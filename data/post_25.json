    "Comments": "Two other positives of the Oxford vaccine is that it should only need to be stored at 2c to 8c, and it costs just over \u00a32 per vaccine to produce, they are offering it to the UK and EU at cost price.Important to note that 99% refers to people who have the antibodies, not efficacy like reported by Pfizer and Moderna. It says in the abstract that coprimary endpoint is efficacy, but it's not reported here. Anyone more familiar with this know why?At this point, the question has to be how many people are going to be co winners of a Nobel prize. Three viable vaccines this week, a year after sars-covid2 was even discovered. Phenomenal.Anyone know what the corresponding antibody rate was for the vaccines that have already announced their efficacy? (e.g. Pfizer and Moderna) - know this is different to the 'headline' 95% (etc) effectiveWill be really interesting to see what the efficacy rate will be when they release phase 3 trial results. Given this is a different vaccine type to Pfizer and Moderna vaccines which had very positive results so far.\n\nLooking at the side effect graphs for the Oxford vaccine does seem to have very common problems for those aged 18-55. Looks like the majority in that group got fatigue and headaches, with a sizeable minority experiencing moderate to severe chills, fatigues, feverish, headaches, malaise, and muscle aches. Fortunately and counter intuitively this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case for the older age groups who will need it the most.[removed][deleted]Forgive the newbie question, but...why doesnt survival from a Covid-19 infection provide a strong immune response?[removed][deleted]I can't even begin to tell you how relieved we all where when the early data readouts occurred. I work close to the industry and we all had a pretty pessimistic view that a vaccine would be viable. \n\nMaybe, just maybe I can get back to the normality of visiting a restaurant or movie theatre next year.Three potential vaccines less than a year after the outbreak. Everyone talking about how we can\u2019t stay locked down forever should\u2019ve just stfu and do what they were told. Much less people would\u2019ve died and we\u2019re probably gonna be able to end the lockdown in the next 6 months or soMan, who are the old people that are testing this.. That would have to be kind of scary for them.Hopefully somebody can answer this question here.\n\nI have a Primary Immune Deficiency condition (CVID) and hence can't take some vaccines.\n\nSo for example I can not take the vaccine for Shingles (Zostavax) but I can take the vaccine for Pneumococcal (even thou after 6 weeks I showed no signs of having taken it)\n\nI do take the Flu Jab every year.\n\nWould this vaccine be suitable for people like myself?Everyone remember that antibody presence is just one factor in whether or not it actually prevents infection.   \n\n\nIt is yet to be seen what the difference between the mRNA vaccines and others will be, though at least Moderna and Pfizer have shown that targeting the spike protein seems to be a winning strategy. That being said, this could have lower (or higher, who knows) efficacy than those or require more boosters.Immune response is NOT protection.\n\nThey reference this in the article but I want it to be clear. Immune response means that your immune system now has produced specific antibodies for component of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. It does not mean your body is capable of sufficiently destroying the virus. Oxford is onto stage III trials where thousands of people are going to be inoculated, and the results will start to speak in volumes rather than pages, but this is just a step in getting our immune systems to be able to combat the virus. This is not a finished product.This is NOT THE PHASE 3 TRIAL RESULTS. This is merely the earlier phase getting peer reviewed. We already had all this info from the pre-print months agoAre we in the midst of a vaccine war?Are all the remaining vaccine candidate sponsors going to rush to finish now that Pfizer and Moderna are at the finish line?  If I'm willing to go get a COVID vaccine and there's one available under EUA, I'm not risking being in the placebo group for Oxford's or anyone else's Phase III.  I want the damn vaccine.[deleted]What about 3/4/5/6 weeks later?How does this compare to Pfizer and Modernas vaccine? Both of those two require freezing temperatures to store it.A murderous rampage meme gets 1k Wholesome awards. This gets 2.At this rate, the next COVID vaccine they announce will have 103 % efficacy.So that's 3 for 3 I'm assuming... Is there anything more that could come up that stops all three in their tracks?\n\nAlso - How does antibody longevity from a vaccine differ from longevity from recovering from an infection itself?Marvellous. How often does it need to be administered though?Was the trial sufficiently powered to draw conclusions about hospitalizations and mortality rates?Is there any research showing transmission prevention on the newly developed vaccines?Wait -- the statements about all ages are very questionable. [Another report](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/oxford-university-vaccine-results-show-strong-immune-response/story?id=74291292&cid=clicksource_4380645_2_heads_hero_live_twopack_hed)notes:\n\n>\u201cThe study includes only healthy participants and not those with co-morbidities or who are frail\u201c The study includes only healthy participants and not those with co-morbidities or who are frail,\u201d the Lancet reports.  \n>  \n>The  study\u2019s participants in the oldest age group had an average age of 73  to 74 and few had underlying health conditions, so the older age bracket  was excluded as were those living in residential care homes. Nor was  there a wide range of backgrounds in the trial participants and \u201calmost  all participants of all ages were white and non-smokers.\u201d  \n>  \n>The next phase of the trials will therefore focus on these groups\n\nSo the test didn't cover all age groups but the headline says it raises hopes \"it can protect age groups most at risk\". Huh?\n\nOh, and gee, almost all participants white. The best of 21st century Oxford clinical science, that? I hope not.\n\n\\[Edited to remove inadvertent duplication in cut and paste, oops\\]Has there been any data / estimates on how long these vaccines might last?Idiot here: But does this prevent spreading of COVID? Does it prevent death or reduce the chances you have to go to the hospital if you get it? I feel like all of the data I've seen so far doesn't answer either of these.\n\nIt seems likely that you can get the vaccine, but still be able to get and spread COVID, it just won't be as severe to you the carrier. Is that incorrect?Have any of these vaccines been tested on young children yet? I have a six year old and 3 month old and I\u2019d like to be as informed as possible.I bet the next one being announced is going to be 99.5% and then the following one 99.9% and then 99.99%...Hell yeah.  Time to kick this viruses ass![removed]It is fantastic the amount of progress that is being made in terms of vaccine development. 1 year to develop a vaccine is phenomenal! I am just really afraid that as this will most likely, become a mandatory vaccine in my part of the world, it might push people towards the 'anti-vax' side of things. Am I the only one that thinks this way? I have seen/heard enough people saying COVID is bogus, that it would not surprise me these people will not get vaccinated.Pfizer: our vaccine is 90% effective but has to be stored at -70C\n\nModerna: our vaccine is 94.5% effective and only has to be stored at -20C\n\nPfizer: Actually our vaccine is 95% effective, we did more tests\n\nOxford Astra Zeneca: Hold my beer.  99% effective, cheap, storage -2C.Anyone willing/able to explain to me how it\u2019s so effective when we have so many mutant variants floating around? How long will this vaccine be effective for? Yearly?Need long term side effects and efficacy levels.  Not enough data to give accurate info at this stage.  \n\n10 years start seeing lawyer ads for covid deaths and severe disabilities because of lack of long term testing before administering vaccine to a massive amount of the population.  \n\nThere is a reason vaccines have an average of 10-12 years for study, testing, and trials.This is good news for the world...but it will still be a long, horrible winter.\n\nAlso:\n\n\"News of the vaccine comes amid a debate in the UK about whether people will be able to see their families over the Christmas period.\"\n\nWhy is this a debate?  Sure, you can see your family...if you'd like to put them at risk.  I think that's up for each family to decide.\n\nMy parents are 90 and 83 respectively.  We are not having any family gatherings this year for Thanksgiving or Christmas...which could be their last regardless of COVID.  I've visited my parents a couple of times (alone) since this started while maintaining my distance and wearing a mask the entire time.  My sister has done the same (though she sees them more frequently as she lives 5 minutes away).\n\nConversely, we're having my 74-year-old mother-in-law over for Thanksgiving dinner.  Why? She's a recent widow and the loneliness is killing her all the same.  That's her decision as well as my wife's.I'd trust a vaccine from Oxford 10000x over anything from US pharma. Its going to be better, and it will be far cheaper and not developed/sold for profit. You cannot trust FDA as well.Read this as Oxford Comma vaccine.  Why would anyone need a vaccine against something so clarifying, easy and beloved?How come there are suddenly thee positive tests published in two weeks? Anyone know any particular reason?Its got a 99.9% recovery rate so I'll pass on the vaccine[deleted]So it's Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford, right?How does the vaccine work and what led to the breakthrough ?Give me all the vaccines!!For how long? This one has a weaker tcell response.Only thing that still scares me about COVID-19 is that we don\u2019t know the long term effects. Could a vaccine like this produce those same effects (assuming there are any)Well, lets give the vaccines to the old and sick and get back to living. That should take about a month.Is this the one that messed up someone's spine, or is that a different Oxford vaccine?\n\nE: Just in case someone reads this comment: it was not.Haha now they want to inject you twice. What\u2019s next 3 times?i give all credit to obama and joe biden they really made this happen. nobel prize for biden for this?Downside is the side effects of getting it are brutal (some cases 103 degree fever), whereas moderna/pfeizer is a little headache and fatigue.Fantastic new - faster, please.ur out of ur mind if you think im taking that vaccineSo now we got 90% , 95% , 99% all we missing is 99.9% and 99.99% like in bleach commercialsyou trust a vaccine that\u2019s been rushed through clinical trials? nah i\u2019ll take my chances.As expected. I called this 6 months ago, \u201cthe first fully successful vaccine with wide deployment will be one of the Oxford candidates\u201d.Something that none of these vaccine makers are talking about is how long the immune response lasts... does it wear off in 2-3 months like the body's natural response? Or does it last for years?Hope so, problems are solved, soon!The doses of vaccine should be given at the same time everywhere to kill off the virus.\n\nIn the US it will be given in stages to allow for reinfection of vaccinated areas.[removed][removed]90% effective to 94.5% to now 99% \n\nI mean, it\u2019s cool and all, but why are they coming out one at a time?[deleted]99%\n\nI swear they're just trying to one up each other at this stage[deleted]Yeah, once again it's all good. But even if it looks like this is the main point unfortunately it's not! You need to show proof for all the people that don't want a vaccine in general until is completely safe! Otherwise soooo many people are gonna refuse to take it! Show that there are no collateral effects whatsoever or anyway mild ones and nothing long term please!My sister told me she will not be getting the vaccine because \u201cwe don\u2019t know the long term effects\u201d. \n\nWhat can I say to her?why is their % just keep going up everytime someone else announce something. first it was 90% effective, then Medera announced theirs at 94-95% and now they up theirs to 99%90% Kraut...oooh err 94% Yank....oooh err, 95% Kraut....ooh err, 99% Brits.\n\nJeez, it's just willy-waving. Of course the Soviets have had a vaccine called Sputnik that's 120% effective since 1957 :)\n\nThe thing to guess is which country will say 99.5% next.What I\u2019m learning is that creating vaccines may not be as hard as we thought If we all work togetherDoes this make three different vaccines with over 90% effectiveness?90% said Pfizer the week before last. Last week Moderna says 95%, now Oxford\u2019s saying 99%.\n\nSanofi press release next week: 103% efficacy.[deleted][deleted]Is there any more known about developing antibodies after a covid-19 infection? Would the vaccine still be required in this case?[removed]What\u2019s the mechanism of this vaccine?The real question I have is does this one come with the same indemnification of liability Pfizer demanded?Only major hospital bill I got actually came in 9 different bills from each physician that saw me, 3 bills for each individual X-ray taken, and 3 bills for each technician, and then the rn, and two doctors I actually saw. It was absurd but I guess because it was a private hospital each of the doctors there were contracted or something? Idk they all billed me individually and it was so strange.And the race is on - who can make the most $  the fastest - why do we still have to take our shoes off at the airport?What I would like to know is how long the antibodies actually stay in the body. Only time will tell.These mRNA vaccines are turning out to be something special, huh?\"Me too! Me too!\"\n\n-- all vaccine researchers right nowThe 3rd was 2 weeks before everything shut downCabt wait till they get it to 111% Ill prob think about taking it then but not until.Time to get patriotic about the vaccine race.\n\nCome on English vaccine!!2 doses?  Interesting.  How many will get the correct 2nd dose?So maybe i can resume ny guitarbuilding workshops somewhere 1st half 2021.\nHappyI'm guessing it won't help against the mink version?That's a relief, the distribution partner here in India for that vaccine has already started manufacturing it. And would sell it at 3$Someone explain neatralising antibodies and if that differes from the moderna and biontech vaccines?What\u2019s it\u2019s effectiveness on the mink mutated strain now in humans?No matter which company gets picked as the \u201cbest\u201d vaccine, we will need atleast 3 manufactures to produce enough supply for the entire world. Looks like Pfizer, Moderna and now AstraZeneca will be the primary soucesIts literally being produced in my city\nHope I get fibsHow long will people be able to resist the virus after having the vaccine?  I thought covid 19 didn\u2019t work with antibodies like other viruses, that people could catch different strains etc.How long do the antibodies last though?[deleted]Is there any information yet about how long these vaccines are effective for?Is it just me or did all these vaccines come out at the same time? The worse it gets the more they sell.By all reports it seems that at least three entirely separate organisations have managed to produce promising vaccine candidates for an entirely novel virus. While I realise it has everything to do with the massive investiture of resources into making it happen, are we just exceedingly lucky in this case?Does that mean Americans will have access to it or are we still focused on the Pfizer vaccination?Good. Now everyone get it and we can continue working and living like normalThis calls for a party! Everyone\u2019s invited.How much time between doses ?What about obese people?Cannot wait to see how long those antibodies last!Curious - we have Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford now - in the grand scheme of things is there going to be a benefit to one over the other, or will they all generally do the same/work the same in the end?Can someone ELI5 how we know a vaccine is effective when we tell the test participants to not go out of their way to contract the virus for ethical reasons? If they are wearing a mask and social distancing how do we know it worked? Simply by measuring antibodies which tells us they, in fact, inadvertently got the virus?Have any of these vaccines been tested on kids?What are the chances the virus could mutate and evade the vaccine?Now watch Trump take credit for this not knowing where Oxford isCan't wait to pay $10k for this in the US...This is the one I was waiting on for the results.Ayyy we\u2019ve won covid is over guysDoes anyone know why all of the news on the vaccines have been released within a week of each other? I get that they all will have started at a similar time, but surely the processes and results along the way differHonest question. Are we ever going to be free of COVID or are we going to have to add this to our booster schedule?Are vaccines usually tested for long term effects as well ? Like long term side effects ?This is the one i want. The 2 set series of mrna based vax that has to be frozen at -73 F is concerning...but it was the first.Care home workers are being offered the Oxford vaccine starting Dec 3rd... Source is a friend who works in a care home and received a letter asking if she wanted the vaccine.Does that mean we are on track to have 3 highly effective vaccines?Very cool. I trust the Oxford vaccine a hell of a lot more than the rushed Pfizer vaccine. Especially now after all the fines that came to light from Pfizer\u2019s subsidiaries.[deleted]What does a vaccine do for someone who already has it? Genuinely curious.So, success.\n\nIt's really unlikely all these vaccines will crap out so one of them with +90% efficiency is going to make it.Hell yeah let\u2019s get this done so we can resume life B.C.Any negative long term side effects?am I allowed to feel optimistic yet?I know people that have been saying not to take the vaccine because it contains mercury. While I understand that studies have concluded the levels of Mercury used in vaccine preservative aren\u2019t consequential to health, it would be much easier to just tell these people that the vaccines don\u2019t contain Mercury at all. \n\nAnyone know how to tell? \n\nI can\u2019t find anything online, and based on what I know, it can be a toss up on whether or not Mercury is used (whether or not vaccines are stored in single use capsules).Not a scientist so feel free to remove this comment, but there are some concerns with the Phizer snd Moderna vaccines surrounding the efficacy process and I want clarification. Are these companies skipping step 2a and moving straight to step 3, or are they merging the two to save time? Either way, could there be long term complications with these relatively early vaccines?\n\nEdit:  not an antivaxer by any means, just concernedSo why is this not on ABC News?Can we expect a vaccine to be released for the public in this next year? Or how long of an estimate would you give for a full public rollout of a covid vaccinationA Prospective Study on Rapidly Declining SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgG Antibodies Within One to Three Months of Testing IgG Positive: Can It Lead to Potential Reinfections?[https://www.cureus.com/articles/46453-a-prospective-study-on-rapidly-declining-sarscov2-igg-antibodies-within-one-to-three-months-of-testing-igg-positive-can-it-lead-to-potential-reinfections?utm\\_source=facebook&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_content=article](https://www.cureus.com/articles/46453-a-prospective-study-on-rapidly-declining-sarscov2-igg-antibodies-within-one-to-three-months-of-testing-igg-positive-can-it-lead-to-potential-reinfections?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_content=article)[removed]Is there clarity on the roll out dates yet? I keep hearing that we'll see it rolled out in the UK prior to Christmas and the approval process is much quicker than the other vaccines. \n\nIs it a case of them releasing results on a Monday, going through approval Tuesday and getting authorisation by the end of the week?It's also a 'conventional' vaccine, rather than mRNA based - so ppotentially a few less unknowns.\n\n**edit** Not so conventional- I have been educated belowAbsolutely essential for poorer countries as we don't have the infrastructure for the Pfizer one.That's huge in regards to storage.  One of the others have to be stored at -100F (-73C)Well we funded the research so it\u2019s only right that we pay cost price for the results.I hope the rest of the world follows their lead with pricing.Cool so if it\u2019s 2\u00a3 per then that translates to virtually unobtainable for us Americans because we\u2019re cash cows.Does it need a booster?This is the results of phase 2, while the Moderna and Pfizer were preliminary results of phase 3 studies. The scuttlebutt seems to be that Oxford/Astrazenica will also release preliminary phase 3 results fairly soon; I'm not sure why it's coming out so close together with phase 2 unless this is finalization of earlier work or an additional study meant to hit different demographics.\n\nThe phase 2 studies are smaller (especially the placebo it looks like) so they going to have trouble getting good statistical results on real world efficacy.\n\ne: fixed some thingsThe results from the Astra Zeneca/Oxford trials are based on a measurable immune response. So 99% of patients who received the active treatment had an immune response. But just because you had a response, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you are actually protected against COVID-19. The immune response may be measurable, but may not actually trigger an appropriate immune response if you actually get COVID-19 in real world conditions. The virus may replicate too fast for the vaccine to actually be effective, or the immune response may not be triggered where it needs it, or a myriad of other things. \n\nSo you have to trial it in the real world, with real viral loads, in the way people actually get the virus. \n\nThe way these trials work is by measuring how many reported cases of COVID-19 there are amongst a huge patient population, I think all the trials aimed for a population of ~40,000 people. \n\nThe null hypotheses would be \u201cif this vaccine doesn\u2019t work, then we would expect to see the same number of people infected in the active group compared with the placebo group.\u201d \n\nSo when you reach a certain percentage of your recruited subjects having tested positive for COVID-19, you then analyse how many of them got the real vaccine vs the placebo.\n\nIf the positive cases are split equally, your vaccine doesn\u2019t work. But if you see a difference, you can start saying just how effective your vaccine is. So if 100 patients in the placebo group get COVID-19 and only 5 patients in your real treatment group gets it, you can say that your vaccine is 95% effective (the numbers are different in the real trials, this just illustrates the concept)\n\nThis is what the Pfizer and Moderna trials mean when they say the vaccine is 94\u201395% effective.You've already been answered basically, but there's a summary here. https://covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/phase-ii-trial-publication\n\nThere are 12 groups of participants in total. This is results from the first three groups. I'm in the Phase 3 trial, which is expecting results soon. \n\nFull paper is here; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32466-1/fulltext\n\nAnd full trial information is in the appendix: https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32466-1/attachment/1246f6f0-bef8-4428-b9d1-cf9aaced64bd/mmc1.pdf\n\nI tried reading through the appendix but it's 213 pages so I gave up a bit. The thing works, basically. The results from the first serology study are page 32, and the group information is page 47.immune response can be directly measured shortly after dosing. efficacy can only be measured after a significant number of participants contract covid (and comparing the ratio of placebo covid vs vaccine covid). this takes much longer.Right. So the question I hand is what antibody results did the other two see? I thought it was 100%. Also, can I get tested to see if I made antibodies?I hope this is our biggest problem of 2021.Only 3.  There can only be 3 people on a nobel prize.We've seen the best and the worst of what humanity has to offer this year. The developers of these vaccines deserve recognition.Nobel prizes aren't normally given out for applications of old technologies, Nobel prizes are for the discovery of a technology.\n\nSo while inventing the adenovirus vaccine may be worthy of a Nobel prize making an adenovirus vaccine wouldn't.\n\nNot to say that they aren't worthy of awards, just not the Nobel prize.> Three viable vaccines this week, a year after sars-covid2 was even discovered\n\nThe work started years ago. It is based on SARS/MERS vaccine.It is a phenomenal timeframe. I believe Oxford has been slowly working on a Corona vaccine for a while now. As you can see by the numbers it shows.The crazy thing is that it took like a month to create the vaccines, and 9-months to test them.  \n\nWe had an effective vaccine for Covid just a few weeks after we knew it was a big deal.  We just didn\u2019t know it yet. \n\nIt would be amazing if we learned enough about mRNA vaccines that in the future, we could confidently develop *and deploy* them on a much faster timeframe.Following established protocols for the purpose of financial gain is hardly Nobel prize worthy.https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-share-positive-early-data-lead-mrna\n\n3.8x the GMT of a normal covid response for young people\n\n1.6x the GMT of a normal covid response for old people.\n\ni wonder if anyone can comment whether this vaccine is more effective at preventing covid than an actual covid immune response would (i.e. a person with the vaccine is less likely to contract covid than someone who got covid and healed).That's just classic \"your immune system is responding\" side effects.  Probably less common in older individuals because of their less active immune systems.Those are normal side effects to a vaccination, because it triggers an immune response. That's what an immune response feels like. Sometimes these are more pronounced than other times. The flu vaccine for example gives me very very mild, almost unnoticeable side effects. But if you know what to look for, you see them, but they're subtle. The worst was the yellow fever vaccination. I actually got a fever for a couple days after that.They are all targeting the same spike protein, so in theory efficacy should be similar. \n\nIn theory.[removed][removed][removed]>The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19,\n\nI.e., how many people still got Covid after being vaccinated.\n\nThis number isn't given in the Findings paragraph.\n\nIs it somewhere else in the paper, and why isn't it more prominent?It does.It does, but it's thought (and this is largely guesswork at this stage) that immunity will last a significantly shorter time than receiving it from vaccines.[removed]Yea this is what I'm curious about. I got Covid recently and I'm still at home in quarantine.\n\nI assume I'll be at the bottom of the list for vaccination as well?I know nothing about this aside from what I've read in this thread and other similar threads but from my understanding we still don't know that antibody response equals immunity so I would imagine everyone would be vaccinated just in case. But somebody who is known to have antibodies would be a lower priority.The Healthcare exodus crisis and suicide crisis will be coming soon. Nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists etc are all absolutely burnt out right now. We are so exhausted. I've seen so many friends and colleagues quit Healthcare forever because of this. I've seen (and experienced myself) so many mental health issues because of all of this.\n\nHonestly, a hard lock down would have sucked for a few months but probably would have been more palatable than 12+ months of fluctuating lockdown. But the virus is only the beginning of a bigger Healthcare crisis.The sad irony is that poor lockdowns increased viral transmission, increased viral transmission got us vaccine efficacy results faster. If we all did what S Korea did (good management, but not elimination), we\u2019d probably be a long way off on vaccine results.So just stay in lockdown, go broke and die of homelessness or hunger?\n\nI don\u2019t think people would be upset about lockdown as much IF THEY COULD AFFORD IT. \n\ni am perfectly happy with it due to WFH, but I wouldn\u2019t be if I lost my job because of it\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also not realistic to ask people to stay in lockdown for like a year and a halfWhat kind of bubble do you live in that you think a year is a reasonable amount of time to be in lockdown? It sounds like you didn't lose your job or your home or have kids that have lost a year of education.\n\nYes, the US response has been terrible. No that does not mean everyone should have been locked down for a year. There is middle ground.On the one hand I agree because the more the virus spreads the more likely it mutates and renders the vaccine ineffective. On the other hand lockdown was mismanaged so badly by our government that I don't blame people for not caring anymore.There are at least ten vaccines that are in various stages of trials, these are just the three that are the furthest along. We'll need as many as we can get.Have you ever been employed or at least are more than 13 years old?\"Shutup and do what your told\"\n\nGreat way to get people to listen to you idiot[deleted]The risk-benefit would be interesting to investigate. Very low chance of dangerous results, with the benefit of covid immunityThis test isn't infecting people with Covid and seeing if they fall sick. They are giving them the vaccine and then testing their blood for antibodies to Covid19. It's not that risky to be in the test group.Whats nice is that this isn't an mRNA vaccine, its a gutted chimpanzee cold virus. Its still been made to produce the spike protein in vivo, so the overall target is the same. This is just a more traditional style vaccine, so hopefully we have a better understanding of its long term effects.From what I've been hearing and reading, much of the resistance to a covid vaccine (even among people who otherwise accept the efficacy and safety of vaccines) is the potential for unknown, long-term side effects of novel vaccines, particularly ones using newer technologies. \n\nHow can we allay these fears?If the R0 is 2.5 [as is the CDC's current best estimate](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html), then we would need 60% (1-1/2.5=0.6) of the population to be immune to lead to the eventual eradication of the virus with no other safety measures. But with >10% of the population already getting immunity the hard way though and measures like concert and bar closures and masks likely to continue a while after the vaccine is being distributed, a lower number will be required to quickly cut it down because those seem to stop just over half the infections that would occur if we did nothing.\n\n(With the [current U.S. Rt of ~1.15](https://rt.live/), a 66% random vaccination changing nothing else would drop the Rt to 0.38. Given it takes on average roughly a week for infections to multiply currently, that would mean if such a level of vaccination magically appeared in America today, our 170,000 cases would drop to under 10,000 cases in the nation within a month.)> Both of those two require freezing temperatures to store it.\n\nModerna's is in a standard freezer though so its not any more a challenge than this one.Only needs to be kept at between 2-8 degrees C, basic refrigeration will do the trick. I hope the phase three results are good because this one is easily distributable.I mean, if all the test subjects go blind I assume that\u2019ll stop it in their tracksWe won't have answers to that until the results of the Phase 3 trial are released. It should be fairly soon.It does *feel* like a press-release arms race, even though I really hope it's not.Those are different numbers, though. This one here simply reflects the number of patients with a detectable amount of antibodies. \n\nStrictly technically, 99% could be developing some antibodies but the vaccine could be completely ineffective at the same time. The number says nothing about the levels of antibodies nor what kind of antibodies. Moderna and BioNtech's data, on the other hand, show the efficacy of their respective vaccines, i.e. how well it *actually* protects the patient from an infection.\n\nNo criticism, of course. Oxford/AZ simply doesn't have that data yet.We don't know how effective it is quite yet, but fingers crossed!This 99% isn\u2019t the effectivenessVaccines are targeting the spike protein, which tends to not mutate. We don\u2019t know how long the vaccines will be effective for - recent studies suggest at least 6 months.Cool, I'm sure you'll be the first one bitching when lockdowns start up again.That's 'cos you can think for yourself and not follow the official narrative, you crazy person...From what I understand these 99% are not the 95% the others reported: this time it was measured wether the immune system produced antibodies, the other two vaccines had 95% of vaccinated people not becoming ill.So far, there are an absolute mountain of potential candidates though.To be exact it is BioNtech (which is the company who discovered the main component of the vaccine), in collaboration with Pfizer, who is in collaboration with BioNtech to produce and distribute the vaccine.Flint stone vitaminestriple autismo\n\njkThat's the big question with all of these.Hepatitis is 2 shots also. American babies like to complain about the smallest things.Have you got a source for this?Got a source? This sounds like an extremely misleading statement.The good news is if multiple vaccines pan out, that shortens the timeline immensely in terms of how long it takes to get into the average persons hands.This has happened with unprecedented speed as is. It's coming.Care to explain?\u201cI\u2019d rather risk lifelong complications from a virus than take a vaccine because there might be lifelong complications.\u201d\n\nNot very rational, are you?There is a reason the trials are for 2 years.  They are taking blood at every appointment to measure antibodies.  \n\nSource:  I am in this trialIt's not odd. It's exactly on schedule. Clinical trials take time, but a predictable amount of time. Late November was always when preliminary results were expected.From their report: 170 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were evaluated, with 162 observed in the placebo group versus 8 in the vaccine group. \n\nThis means that the vaccine group effectively warded off infection compared to the placebo.[This Slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2020/11/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html) addresses this question in paragraphs 4 -- 6. The short version is that we do not yet know if the vaccines will prevent transmission in humans. There are primate studies that give reason for optimism, but we don't have enough data from human studies to know for sure.You definitely read wrong. I think you may mean that the vaccine may not prevent a person from spreading.\n\nMeaning a person who is immune could spread the virus in some way, but the other people around them should be immune too.\n\nSo at herd immunity it would just stop circulatingCan you please provide a source for this? I\u2019ve never heard anything like this.99% neutralizing antibody response does not mean the vaccine is 99% effective. We won\u2019t know for weeks to months if it actually prevents infections. We knew months ago it generated an immune response. The main news here is older people seem to be reacting to it.Please don't comment misleading and incorrect information when you haven't read or understood the article, thanks.Just wait for next week when it's 102% effective somehow.Pfizer did that by bragging when they got to 90%.Do you hear yourself? Or are you just echoing Rand Paul? A vaccine that is 99% effective does NOT kill the other 1%. And the death rate of covid is around 3%, maybe even more.They were devising a plan to get the public to accept it back in July https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2020/200709-The-Publics-Role-in-COVID-19-Vaccination.pdfVery few people are incompetent enough to be anti-vax. Standard procedures are fine for this vaccine, as they are for every vaccine.What do yo mean by \"what can I say to her\"? She's not incorrect, is she?You could list the possible long term effects of getting covid? Lung damage, etc....You say that's a very logical concern and more people need to start using that type of logic.\"We don't know the long term effects of getting COVID\"\n\nThe risk of taking the vaccine is far lower than getting COVIDMarketing> now Oxford\u2019s saying 99%.\n\nIt's not 99% effectiveness. We don't know the effectiveness yet.Oh, so Trump is pro vax now?[deleted]Please tell me this is satire.>ELI5 why 99% builds up antibodies but the vaccine is said to be only 95% or so effective?\n\n1. They've not said how effective it will be at this stage (this vaccine is slightly behind the other 2 in terms of development).\n\n2. If you don't have *enough* antibodies, you can still get ill. It's a bit like putting a lock on your front door - anything is helpful, but if it is too weak, the virus will still kick the door down.Misread as  \u201cgarterbuilding\u201d which was even more interesting. \n\nGood luck either way!This doesn't seem to be a question about the vaccine, but rather the long term effects of COVID19. Another sub might be a more appropriate place to ask this.Not yet. We'll have to wait and see.The goal is to enroll 40k people in the trial and have them go about their lives. After a certain number get covid they\u2019ll compare the placebo group to the vaccine group and see how many more people get sick in the placebo groupThe place III trial is for 2 doses weeks apart. But that\u2019s all we know at this point4 weeks[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][deleted]> Is it a case of them releasing results on a Monday, going through approval Tuesday and getting authorisation by the end of the week?\n\nWe take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's, we go in, take care of Philip - \"I'm so sorry, Philip\" - then we grab Mum, we go over to Liz's place, hole up, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.Not really, I wouldn\u2019t realistically expect any vaccine to be rolled out before Christmas due to the bureaucratic, administrative and logistical issues involved with such a task. I think February is the earliest they\u2019ll be any kind of vaccine available. A lot of what you\u2019ve heard is going to be hype for various reasons, some political others just wishful thinking which whilst it\u2019s good be hopeful I think it\u2019s created a lot of unrealistic expectations.\n\nWould love to be wrong though...It\u2019s not a conventional vaccine though. Conventional vaccines use an attenuated or inactivated virus to stimulate the immune system. The AstraZeneca vaccine is an adenovirus vectored vaccine, which is fairly new technology for vaccines. The virus isn\u2019t stimulating the immune system, its primary job is just to deliver genetic information to your cells. It\u2019s actually pretty similar in concept to the mRNA vaccines because they\u2019re both delivering genetic information that instructs your cells to build their own viral proteins. I think there have only ever been a couple of these type of vaccines approved previously.[deleted]If we want to wave hands though, APCs presenting viral antigens would lead to a more robust immune response compared to 'conventional'. So in that case the mRNA platform would be superior. \n\nI'm just bored, but in reality having multiple options is going to be huge in stopping the pandemic. Vaccines only provide short term immunity? Cool we can stack them and get around that.That\u2019s the Pfizer/biontech and they\u2019re now saying it might not actually need to be stored in a -80 freezer.One study found covid immunity lasts a few years by extrapolating the number of T(memory) cells you retain after infection. Obviously we can't know for sure for a few years but long term immunity looks possible.\n\n[Article](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-role-of-t-cells-in-covid-19-infection-why-immunity-is-about-more-than-antibodies/)No one really knows - Coronavirus vaccines haven't been around long enough to know how long their viral immunity lasts.[deleted]It looks like this is the publication of the peer reviewed article on the phase 2 results. This info was released to the press a while ago already. Getting the publication through takes time afterwards. The phase 3 results from the other two aren't the peer reviewed publication yet either.I see. But wouldn't they have to unblind in order to say x % of people who got the vaccine have the antibody?  And if they're unblinding, why can't they look at efficacy while they're at it?\n\nI understand that pfizer and moderna have set trigger numbers to get that preliminary efficacy %, is it also what's happening here? Do they need to get to that trigger number first regardless?\\>  I'm not sure why it's coming out so close together with phase 2 unless this is finalization of earlier work or an additional study meant to hit different demographics \n\nI work at Oxford for the vaccine. Both really. This lancet publication takes mostly lab data to see if antibodies have been produced. Whereas the efficacy that is coming out soon looks at the overall data. And it just so happens that the results are out at a similar time.[deleted]Two things as to why results are coming closer.\n\nThere are lots of trial groups. They have more recently added in smaller groups of older people to the trial. So this adds to that.\n\nThey also added a second \"booster\" shot to the trial late summer and then did a second round of blood tests. (I just had my 2 month blood test after the booster at the end of October)I just want to thank you for introducing me to the word \"scuttlebutt\". I shall use it daily.>\t... may not actually trigger an appropriate immune response if you actually get COVID-19 in real world conditions.\n\nMinor correction, but when talking about the virus, it\u2019s SARS-CoV-2, the disease is COVID-19. So you hope a vaccine prevents COVID-19 when you are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.[deleted]Thanks for explaining this. The issue I have with this approach is that it ignores asymptomatic patients. What if the vaccine simply reduces symptoms but people still contract the virus? This would go largely unnoticed in trials like the Pfizer one, since to my understanding, they detect covid cases through patient self-reported symptoms and subsequent testing.It's amazing to me that the Oxford vaccine hasn't reported yet. They must've vaccinated 30 - 40,000 people across the world but have yet to have around 100 cases. I wonder if it's a case of designing the trial to early before they realised where the majority of infections would occur within a population.It's not. Climate change is. And also economic recoveries as a result of this pandemic.\n\n\nWell, assuming nothing else unexpected turns up which I'm sure it will.The biggest problem of 2021 will be the anti-vaxxers.  Good luck getting people to take any of these vaccines and getting the pandemic behind us.The Nobel prize is usually received many years after the actual achievement, though. So probably more of a problem in 2035 or something.The biggest problem of 2021 will be convincing people that these vaccines are safe! I\u2019ve heard so many people say they are skeptical and won\u2019t want one just yet!\n\nI suppose on the bright side the queue to get one won\u2019t be as long.Corona health wise speaking wont be over in 2021. Maybe in 2022You think the pandemic will end in 2 months? It will probably continue until next summer.Thanks, I didn't realize there was a cap already set. Makes sense, I suppose.It's certainly their moment to shine and they succeeded with flying colors. Most would not give a damn about them a 2 years ago or so and now whole world is watching them.Well... a little revisionist.  \n\n\nSkipping out the bits of history where millions of people were murdered just because.  \n\n\n2020 has been bad, it's no where been the worst year in history in regards to humanity.I dunno, I would be worrying about the death threats, apparently using STEM to save lives is the work of antifa. (I wish this was purely sarcastic)I know. But the work on vaccines started over a century ago with some milk maids if you want to play that game.All science builds on the science that came before it, always.Nope, by far not all of them.\n\nThe development of BioNTech's vaccine (called very misleadingly the \"Pfizer\" vaccine in American media), the first to deliver phase 3 results, started in mid January.We don't know the answer to that question yet, but I believe there is some reason to think the vaccines might be more effective. \n\nI'm not a virologist or an immunologist, so someone correct me if I'm wrong, but there's been some talk about about problems resulting from the different spike protein conformations. When the spike protein of coronaviruses fuse to a cell (which is how they get into a human cell) they undergo a conformational change. So there are two versions of the virus protein- prefusion and post fusion. Your natural immune response to viral infection may be more likely to form antibodies to the post-fusion spike protein, or form a mix of antibodies. If there are fewer antibodies to the pre-fusion spike protein, then you won't stop replication of the virus in your body, because the virons with the pre-fusion spike protein will fly under the radar and be able to infect cells. \n\nOn the other hand, I believe most of the promising vaccine candidates are using a stabilized pre-fusion spike protein to stimulate immunity. This means your immune system will form antibodies against the version of the virus that infects cells, which would lead to infection being less likely.True but the method of delivery is very different.[removed][removed]I don't believe they have released those numbers yet. Another article I read said they were expected some time in December.How do they actually test that, I'm curious do they give someone from the trail an injection with the actual virus?Thanks!So far the natural immunity is holding strong in the vast majority of casesNot to mention how many livelihoods have been tanked and rent crises to come. I unfortunately picture many suicides stemming from it along with upwards of a year of isolation and years to coming reeling from the economic fallout.I wish more people were able to empathize with those who can't go without working for *a few months*, because even a single 1,200 dollars stimulus doesn't really help everyone, with everything for that long.\n\nForcing tens-of-millions of people out of work for a few months would have absolutely lead to more homelessness, and more suicides. If you get more people having to live outside or in group shelters, you'd see a much bigger spike in infections too.\n\nThis was a *hard* situation, and it was made even worse because the people in charge waited *too many months* to do anything about it. Now it's everyone's problem and nobody really has an answer.You need a fluctuating lockdown though because even if a real hard lockdown happened for 3 months the vaccines are not going to arrive faster than they are.\n\nThe real problem, at least here in the UK is the piss poor communication from the govt, the rules that make no sense with one contradicting another and so many instances of the govt having to u turn because they fucked up.Exactly what I was thinking. Large parts of the world fucked this up badly, but we'd have no vaccine results if they hadn't.It's not realistic to live in one of the wealthiest first world countries in the world, have no safety net, have no real financial continuous  assistance while having politicians dimantle and deny there was a pandemic response in place, deny science, muddle discourse, and use a global tragedy as a tool to personally profit and divide its citizens.  That is what is unrealistic about this whole thing.Thank you! I\u2019m glad someone said this. Everyone wants a lockdown until they have no job. The same people who are fine with staying inside ad infinitum are the same people who stayed inside before this. They don\u2019t understand the psychological toll that prolonged lockdown has. Nor do they understand the implications lockdown has on the economy. Yes I get it lives are important too, but tell that to families that can\u2019t put bread on the table, they\u2019ll gladly take a chance to get sick over bankruptcy any dayA study of something like 18,000 versions the SARS-CoV-2 genome collected from around the world actually showed that it isn\u2019t very prone to mutation. The few mutations it did show were generally random and benign, not selection driven. If those results hold true, things are looking really good for these vaccines long-term.\n\nI\u2019ll try to find a link to the study, read the synopsis in C&EN a couple weeks ago.Yeah but wasn't the whole point of being opposed to lockdown that the government shouldn't tell you what to do?  Those people are just holding their own wants above the needs of the rest of us because they *decide that it's okay to do so*.  Assuming they're being held to their own standards, at least.Vaccine? Or virus?Conservatives have been crying for years that we don't need a \"nanny state\" government, and by and large, people will do the right thing in a time of crisis if we leave their free will uninhibited. We set up our government in a way such that free choice (at least free choice to do the things conservatives want to do) was prioritized over all, and then when COVID-19 came around to test that system it failed in the worst way possible. Just like always we got the government we deserved and now we are finally seeing the consequencesIt's selfish to need to work, pay rent or mortgage, not lose your business, want an education for your child? \n\nThis was a terrible lose-lose situation with no good answers. Yes, the US response was terrible and we have hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths. That does not mean it is \"selfish\" that we didn't lock down for a YEAR. The bubble that people on reddit live in is unbelievable.I believe he is suggesting it\u2019s risky to get the vaccine.As I understand it Pfizer pushed for and received indemnity from any lawsuit for long-term harm from their vaccine (i dont have any information on the other two).\n\n**Not doing that** would be a good start but evidently the company bottom line is more important than lives.Personally, I'll feel much better when the rush dies down to the point that there's enough to go around.  I'm not nearly as worried about the side effects as I am about the quality control implications of trying to make as much vaccine as possible, as quickly as possible.There are unknown long-term risks and effects of actually having COVID-19 too, and preliminary long-term effects data from having COVID not looking stellar. \n\nSo people will have to roll the dice one way or the other. I\u2019ll take my chances with a vaccine, thanks.I've been wondering that myself. I am 100% with vaccinations in general and agree high-risk people should get even a quickly produced one as they are high-risk anyway. But I've never been in the situation of having to decide to get a fast-produced vaccine or not. \n\nI would have the flexibility to just keep doing the like 90% quarantine and being really careful when in public that I've already been doing and could technically wait a few months after it's available to my age group to see if any hiccups happen. As a personal choice, that seems legitimate...\n\nBut if I look at it from the view of doing the best for my community and for the global community, is it still ethical/moral to wait after the vaccine is ready when a huge part of the worst of the disease is the spreading by asymptomatic people? I don't know how to answer that.The biggest problem is going to be symptoms.  Right now I have almost 0 chance of getting corona (My family has been quarantined for 8 monthes).  But getting two shots where the first one might put give me a flu like state, makes getting the second shot less likely. \n\nI think there's also a very high risk.  Everyone is panicked about Covid, this is what people wanted but this isn't some magic drug that will just work, and thus people are still VERY afraid about the efficacy of it, or just finding out in six months it stops working and they suddenly catch it. \n\nThe best thing to do is show early adopter are ok going forward.  While any negative side effect they show will cause panic.... and there will be negative side effects, showing NO negative side effects or telling them that nothing bad can happen is both false, and will make them more afraid.Well this particular vaccine uses much more traditional techniques so hopefully that might help.You can't. I've seen many people present the mountains of evidence that show that the risk of taking a vaccine is likely far lower than getting the virus itself, and people will still dig their heels in with 0 counter-evidence and say \"nope, my bad feelings trump your evidence\"\n\nIt's a futile exercise to try and change their minds. Oh well, I'll get my vaccine sooner and then I'm no longer a hostage of the death cult[deleted]That would be fantastic.This is just serological conversion, while Pfizer for example actually reported rates of covid19. While impressive, until we see actual covid rates with this one, we won't know how they stack up. 99% percent developed antibodies, but that doesn't directly correlate to 99% prevention of illness.BBC: Two weeks after the second dose, more than 99% of participants had neutralising antibody responses. These included people of all ages.\n\nI guess thats not the same - wishful thinking on my part. await peer reviewed phase 3 trial results then.We get a haircut every month or so, that would be a slight inconvenience to return to normal and until something more effective is crafted, \n\nThis has also probably pushed all sorts of vaccine developmental science forward decades.\n\nI\u2019m very optimistic for next year and it feels great after this one.*think of yourself\"The government is using it to control us\" - Alex Jones probablywhy would i get a vaccine for something that kills under 1% of people that get it, and if they make it mandatory... that doesnt scare you a little? especially funded by bill gates (who can end world hunger and still have money left over) who made all his money in tech suddenly decides hes a the crusader of virology for the world is obsessed with a vaccine[deleted]But I do understand it?You will be protected and there's a 2% chance it cures anyone within a 6ft radius.No, she\u2019s not incorrect.\n\nI just wonder what good having a vaccine is going to do when many people are scared to get it.There\u2019s no real way to verify that though. She is a nurse and is convinced she would be fine if she got it (which in all likelihood she would). In addition she is telling my mother who is in multiple high risk groups that the vaccine would be a risk.True, true. I was commenting on the weird one-upmanship going on here. 90% was an impressive claim at the beginning.[deleted]This is, unfortunately, a fairly common belief.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Can anyone explain whether, if being immunocompromised increases the risk from the coronavirus itself, those people are better protected by giving them some or all of the vaccinations likely to become available in the next few months themselves, or by vaccinating those around them? I don't know how well someone immunocompromised is expected to respond to these vaccines compared to someone who is not. I also don't fully understand whether the vaccines being discussed are expected to prevent serious problems developing in the recipients if they are exposed to the virus, or to prevent them from becoming carriers who help the virus to propagate, or both. It seems like who you'd want to prioritise for vaccination in order to protect the most vulnerable as much as possible would depend very much on the answers to those questions.Oxford is a part of OWS.  If the data is correct they will be approved by Xmas for release.You are wrong, fortunately!Maybe in the US, but I know from people who work in the NHS here, they're being told no later than the first week of January and more likely from the start of December.The AstraZeneca is a variation of a MERS vaccine that had been In the works for several years and went into testing this past January. They made a slight modification for Covid-19 and were able to start testing it right away.Thanks for educating me, I clearly got this wrong and have edited my comment. \n\nDo you have a good link that explains how this vaccine approach works? My Google-fu is failingjust a small addition (*italics)* to clarify your excellent summary (for my biology students):  .......they\u2019re both delivering genetic information that instructs your cells to build their own \\[*SARS-CoV-2*\\] viral proteins *that then stimulate your immune system to produce antibodies*.Mutated = replication deficient = can't reproduce \n\nIt is more accurate to say modified than mutant. Mutated implies lack of control. \n\nIt was precision engineered and each batch is analyzed for consistency.Since it's Oxford it sounds like chimpanzee adenovirus vector i.e. ape, not monkey. Also the method has been tested for safety before, it's not the first vaccine based on thisPfft you make it sound so buzzwordy... Just call it what it is, a modified adenovirus that can't replicate but expresses SARS-CoV-2 proteins.If it's 99% effective... the more antivaxxers the better. Vaccines for us, COVID for them.\n\nThen allow health insurances to charge different premiums based on vaccination status. Maybe with a cutoff date (you can still get the vaccine but not the discount).> having multiple options is going to be huge in stopping the pandemic\n\nKind of like the various HIV suppression approaches - treatment was kind of limited effectiveness until the researchers started testing cocktails. Makes it harder for the viruses to evolve their way out of an attack.Yes, adaptive trial designs are the future, but they are complicated and risky.I'm in a phase 3 trial for this now. On the consent it says they've finished phase 2.I think the issue is basically just size. The phase 3 trials that I've seen have had 30k-60k people to get a total of 100ish cases. This has 560 people, with 420 in the vaccine group and 140 in the placebo group. If you end up with 0 cases in the vaccine group and 1 in the placebo, you just can't infer much from that. You'd need super super high infection rates before you could do much with a group that small.What you\u2019re talking about is the \u201cpower\u201d of the study. When an effect size doesn\u2019t meet the statistical requirements to determine that efficacy is due to the treatment a study is considered \u201cunderpowered\u201d. \n\nThe short answer is by having a really large sample size. The larger your sample size, the higher the accuracy.\n\nThey\u2019ll have modelled infection rates to determine a sample size large enough that so long as the effect size is clinically meaningful that they can show with a high degree of statistical certainty that the effects are due to the vaccine and not chance and/or placebo. Which turned out to be about 40,000 subjects.\n\nWith an effect size of 95% it\u2019s pretty clear that the vaccine is causing the effect, not statistical variance.It\u2019s definitely a possibility, but you\u2019re not going to get giving people coronavirus past an ethics board to test whether you simply reduce symptoms =P\n\nBut there will be follow up analysis to further explore whether the vaccine simple reduces symptoms or whether it offers a higher level of protection. This won\u2019t be the end, at all.\n\nUntil the papers are released I can\u2019t really address this further.This seems strange to me. Wouldn't doing COVID tests every few days on all the people in their trial be cost effective and reasonable to track actual cases of the virus?Well it's actually funny in a sense; the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had participants in America, so they got their data quicker because there's so many people infected....Our biggest challenge will be convincing millions of people that climate change is a legitimate threat to human existence.To be honest dealing with climate change isn\u2019t just a 2021 one thing. And we can start dealing with in a much different way than Covid. We don\u2019t need to have it consume every moment of your life and it doesn\u2019t need to have such a social and economic impact. The process of fixing it I mean. \nAlso fixing the economy after Covid is going to be easier than it seems right now.Well, climate change and contending with an ever-changing workforce that will continue to become more and more automated.I wish more people understand the link between climate change and pandemics. As animals are forced to find new habitats it exposes humans to potential new pathogens. \n\nThese concepts are linked but I'm sure the climate change deniers are likely also the covid deniers, flat earthers, anti-masker, anti-vaxer, moon landing hoax believers so it will be hard to get these people on board for these efforts.He says climate change, as literally millions die from a virus.This was going to be a far bigger issue when they were hopeful the vaccine was going to be in the 50-60% effective range. \n\nNow that it is 90-95% effective, even with the anti-vax and the 'wait it out to see' groups we will still be able to achieve herd immunity for the most part.\n\nNo body expected anything like 90%+ efficacy so that's incredible.Anti vaxxers hardly matter. With efficacy so high, as long as you get the vax, you really don\u2019t have anything to worry about after. Sure, anti vaxxers may still be susceptible, but why would I care at that point?With the simulation coming to an end, we can expect more of the absurd and unexpected.They'll have to get it if they want to travel anywhere.I think it has made a lot of people realise what is really important.This is actually really important, though, because SARS and MERS have been really big problems for Asia and the Middle East. There just hasn\u2019t been enough of a critical threat worldwide to justify spending enough to get these vaccines across the finish line. Now, however, there is a real need for the science to get finished.\n\nTo reduce this specific instance to \u201cvaccines exist\u201d ignores the fact that a form of this particular vaccine has been in development for a long time, so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that it appears accelerated.Just as Newton said \"if i have seen further its because i was standing on the shoulders of giants\"It\u2019s also misleading to just call it biontechs vaccine. By their own admission, the partnership with Pfizer has knocked years off the development.\n\nAlso, biontech and moderna are both using the same basic mRNA approach.Also the simple act of having a second dose a month later will undoubtedly mean your immune system has been trained twice, whereas it would be a one off if you get it naturally with no control over the viral load.Statistics and large numbers. When you have your control group that have a significant portion (and I mean statistically significant, not in the colloquial sense) get COVID but your experimental group doesn't, you can start drawing conclusions.\n\nhttps://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine\n\nhttps://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/modernas-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-meets-its-primary-efficacyThat's a whole other issue as well. Hard lock down needs to come with financial safety nets for the populace. I don't claim to be a financial expert though and feel more qualified speaking to the Healthcare issues.they can both be unrealistic man. its not one or the other[deleted]Yeah my layman's understanding is that the attachment protein that illicits the immune response is relatively stable and even the rest of the virus mutates at about half the rate of influenza which is good. That being said, I wouldn't want to take any chancesJust to piggyback off this for a mechanism of stability. \n\nCoronaviruses encode a proofreading enzyme (NSP14 in SARS-CoV2) which lowers their mutation rate to close to that of eukaryotic cells. I can\u2019t quickly find a specific mutation rate for SARS-CoV2, but I\u2019ll edit this if I can find a good citation. \n\nProofreading mechanism and general genomic structure paper, if you\u2019re really [bored/interested](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276520305189#bib79)and people supporting lockdown are/were holding their own wants above the need of the rest too. lockdown has affected many people, they need to eat and mental health problems have increased a lot\n\nmany people are more likely to die from hunger or suicide than covid. those people have needs tooI think the reasons are varied for opposing lockdown, I agree with lockdown for the most part but you would expect the govt. to do their bit (and follow the rules they set out) but they did neither and used it to give billions of pounds of contracts to their friends and family in business. I understand people's resentmentVirus sorry I'll edit, don't know why but I started using the two interchangeably leading people to believe I'm an anti vax nutterThe CEO scheduled a sale of over half his stock holdings when he knew the approx date that the interim results would be released. That\u2019s another under-appreciated red flag. The design of these phase III trials borders on the absurd, too many unknown variables and unanswered questions to assert a reliable confidence interval without a much larger nThis. COVID would probably cause way more damage than vaccine could, especially for people who are high-risk. \n\nI\u2019m not taking the chance of catching it.Oh they won't make it mandatory if you're in the US.  I'm just hoping every public function and school will be asking for vaccine paperwork at the door and barring those who don't have it unless they have other paperwork saying they can't take it for other health reasons.   You can have your freedom, just not amongst the rest of us.  That's the compromise.No you don't. Your comment implies that this 99% is in any way related to the 94.5% and 95% out of Pfizer and Moderna. Those are efficacies. This 99% is a percentage of people who simply showed an immune response.\n\nTwo different metrics from two different stages of the trials. You can't compare them. No one is one upping anyone, they are reporting their data.Roll for initiativePeople won\u2019t be too scared to get it when countries start lifting restrictions conditionally to your vaccination status. Want to travel? Go to a packed theater? You need to be vaccinated.She\u2019s a nurse? Report her to the medical college for being an anti-vaxxer.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be in the medical field if she\u2019s anti-vax.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]I think they may have mispoken. Normally immunocompromised can't have vaccines at all. But if everyone around the immunocompromised person is immune, then they don't have anyone to catch it off, known sometimes as herd immunity.\n\nI think the priority will be:\n\n1) Vulnerable (old people, people with breathing problems like asthma)\n\n2) Health workers\n\n3) Everyone else I guess\n\nMaybe the families of immunocompromised people or something would be included in 2, or in between 2 & 3.I don\u2019t have an exact answer, but I\u2019m semi-immuno compromised (cyclic neutropenia)and when I talked to my doctor she said that I don\u2019t really have an increased chance to get it or anything, but if I were to get it when I was going through a cycle that it could be bad. But also what I have is more affected by bacteria than viruses so it\u2019s not an exact comparisonThe approval of a new drug is much more than just looking at the data of clinical studies.In the US many medical professionals I work with are expecting December time frames too. But that's just for phase 1 groups.Yes that\u2019s true. It\u2019s still not a conventional vaccine.Why if they were able to start testing right away, are there news reports of two other vaccines that appear closer to approval and distribution?I've been trying to find one that explains the premise to a lay audience but haven't found much. [This](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/vector-based-vaccines-come-to-the-fore-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-67915) article talks a bit about the idea behind them, some history, and some common challenges, though.At least in protein engineering mutate doesn\u2019t imply lack of control.And what are we but great apes.Yes, it's adenovirus. Sara Gilbert talked about her work on it and career so far on BBC's Life Scientific podcast on 15 Sep. Fascinating stuff.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/0fCnLRLOeovnN6jleet9jH?si=lZ1-Lg7aSiKQodg9otxfrQ[removed]It would be the first FDA-approved adenovirus vector vaccine though right? At least that was my understanding.\"great\" apes he said, braggart.this monkey's gone to heavenRisky in terms of potentially lost capital / investment or risky in terms of side effects and such?Ah gotcha, I totally missed that. I think I'm just thrown off by the phrase efficacy is the coprimary endpoint in the abstract - like why put it there at all if they can't even get meaningful data yet? \n\nEither way this is still good news. 2 great results, 1 getting there, and we have dozens if not hundreds more in the pipeline.There are 12 groups in the trial overall; this is serology (antibody test) results from the first 3 or 4 groups which are smaller. There are some very large groups and some smaller groups for measuring efficacy of different doses.That\u2019s what I would think too, but perhaps asking 40,000 people to test every few days is unrealistic and would slow down the trial?The even bigger problem is convincing them of that and also that they should act. Many will accept it's a problem, but it's a problem for when they're dead and buried.If the virus has shown is anything, it's that even in the face of overwhelming evidence, those who don't want to believe will bury their heads in the sand and say it's not true. I'm in a hundred years as crops literally cannot grow and fresh water becomes scarcer, as the polar ice caps completely vanish, people will still be talking about how this is just normal variations in the climate and an ice age will come again before long. They'll say it's a hoax and the media is just exaggerating to scare them into putting money toward \"liberal schemes.\" They'll starve to death believing that it was because all these immigrants scammed their way into refugee status and shouldn't have been allowed into their country in the first place.I propose naming hurricanes after corporations with proven history of worsening climate change.\n\n\"Hurricane Exxon Mobil devastating Florida leaving thousands homeless\" will make an interesting headlineIs there a vaccine for it?[deleted]Given how many people have denied a global deadly pandemic that is staring them in the face... my hopes aren\u2019t highWe can definitely reduce the environmental impact we have. We have time to be smart about it and not ruin lives in the process. It starts with accepting nuclear energy and figuring out how to store energy in large enough quantities. We can slowly transition away from gas powered products.\n\n\nI\u2019m still highly skeptical that climate change will cause irreversible damage and the degree of human impact. But hey what\u2019s wrong with finding new sources of technology anyways?No humans continue to hunt and eat pretty much every endangered species on the planet.. climate change will not stop hominid destruction.Not exactly seeing how bats and pangolins poached from Africa who have always been in Africa and shipped to China has anything to do with habitatNew habitats had nothing to do with this. This was man made by mixing species that don\u2019t belong together in a live meat market, and eating those endangered and exotic animals raw. This is China in a nut shell. It happens annually there, this one just happened to be a bit worse than usual.My suggestion, at least in the US, is to tie a stimulus check/tax credit to getting vaccinated.\n\n$1200 check vs Facebook conspiracy theory, who would win?[deleted]>\tanti vaxxers may still be susceptible, but why would I care at that point?\n\nBecause they may still visit hospitals and live with elderly and immunocompromised folks who can\u2019t get vaccinated.you should cause even if you are inmune if they keep getting sick things will remain closedI hope I got a high score this run.I highly doubt other states or even airlines will require vaccines to travel - countries might.I'm afraid that human memory is short and fallible in many other ways, too.This is the best argument against letting pharmaceutical companies\"follow the money\". There were people a decade ago who were quite disappointed that the MERS vaccine wasn't finished just because the disease went away.\n\nWe could have had a covid vaccine months earlier if we hadn't dropped the ball back then.Idk, maybe we're coming from completely different places.  There's a difference between questioning how stringent a lockdown really needs to be vs protesting that you should be able to put others in danger if you so choose.I'm well aware, I read the article and made what (to me) is obviously a joke.Considering most countries don't require the normal vaccinations to go to school etc I think that will be the exception and not the norm.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][deleted]I'm hoping they put teachers and essential workers at number 3 & 4, then everyone else including me. If we are going to keep schools and shops open then give those shelf stackers and teachers the vaccine first. They are in much more contact with people than I am.Prioritisation is going to be more complicated than that, for example in the U.K. healthcare workers will likely be vaccinated in parallel with the over-85s and care home residents in the first phase of delivery.Hopefully this type of vaccine do become conventional.Their own schedule, I suppose. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to be months behind on their approval timeline, either. They also had a pause in their study for a brief period of time which slowed it down, but it\u2019s resumed again.In all of biology I have never heard mutate = lack of control.[removed]As far as I know none of them have FDA approval, but if [phase III](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746) goes as well as we all hope, it should be the first of its kind to get it.people can stop a trial in phase 2 to stop sinking money into it if it is unsafe or ineffective. by combining phase 2/3, you sink money into phase 3 at risk without knowing its safety or efficacy first to make that judgement.Capital and investment.Both those are pretty closely relatedYes.Still, the important thing to realize about this is that the most impactful thing is systemic change: large scale international transition plans, major investments in industry, much higher regulation on pollution, crackdowns on climate misinformation, recognizing that the current structure of economic growth *cannot* continue. If countries such as Nigeria, China, and India ever reach the consumption per capita as the US, the planet will not be able to sustain it.\n\nIndividual action should include doing what you can, but also needs to include work with climate organizations and work to pressure governments to apply priority to climate change action. \n\nThe reality is corporations pushed the \u201ctalk with your wallet\u201d messaging because they know it is completely infeasible: https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Dark%20Money%20Chpt%20SCCC%20Climate%20Crisis%20Report.pdf\n\nOne, many people just won\u2019t do it.\n\nTwo, many people do not have the funds to say buy an electric car when tens of millions in the US alone don\u2019t even have enough to cover a $500 unexpected expense.\n\nThree, many individual actions may \u201cseem\u201d good but aren\u2019t actually good. Look at how oil companies lied about recycling for decades, when it was largely a sham: https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled\n\n*Four, most importantly, our economic structure could not handle if individuals all made the consumption choices needed to be made to slow climate change*. \n\nFor individuals to slow climate change, this would require drastic reductions in consumption. If the hundreds of millions, even billions, of people that needed to do this did this, it would lead to a major collapse in consumer demand. Millions of businesses would go under. Hundreds of millions of jobs would be lost. We do not have a economic safety net that would be able to handle such a drastic change. Poverty and hunger would increase dramatically, and there would be no work for people to get, since jobs would have become significantly more scarce.\n\nLook what happened during COVID when consumer demand was reduced - how many lost jobs, businesses closed, millions entered poverty (world bank estimated extreme poverty will rise by over 100 million this year because of it).\n\nThe reality is we need to reduce consumption and production, i.e. GDP, by a significant margin to fight climate change (and we cannot support the billions of people in the world \u201ccatching up\u201d to US GDP). This can be done well, if it is planned. There can be support structures for economic survival, such as a UBI, but if this degrowth occurs without such planning it will be a disaster.\n\nhttp://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue87/Hickel87.pdf\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652610000259\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/02/10/can-we-have-prosperity-without-growthTbh nobody is going to do anything because we still have people bickering over small things like basic human rights, people don't care that winter is going to disappear and that forests will be on fire all the time because if they can just eat good food and sit around then life's all good until they die. At this stage, we're dead men walking.Forget climate change for a moment,though I fully recogize that it\u2019s the bigger problem.  I have sincere doubts that we could even get people to take a 99% effective COVID-19 vaccine.  \n\nNow try convincing those same people to come together to fight climate change.  We almost need American democracy to fall and be replaced by something that will ignore the extremely vocal minority that doesn\u2019t believe in science. Even then I\u2019m not sure if we can react at the speed we need to if we want to slow warming.Americans will just say it's god's will and that there's nothing we can do, even if it burns their house down in a forest fire or destroys it in a hurricane.\n\nAmericans will go to their last breath doing everything in their power to remove all ethical responsibility off of themselves. \"It's not my problem\" is the American mantra.\n\nThis pandemic has shown that America lacks the ability to do what's right. 250,000 dead and **70 million** people voted for the administration that let that happen.\n\nAmerica is in its death throes. You can't come back from a country infected by the conservative parasite that has eaten its way into the heads of 70 million+ people and made a permanent home. That ship has sailed. There's just no coming back from that.Reminds of this article I found the other day. https://www.theroot.com/they-stop-yelling-at-you-when-they-get-intubated-south-1845691330/UK and Europe they are bringing in some pretty strong legislation outlawing fossel fuels coupled with big sustainability plans. They understand that individuals resuing a carrier bag arent going to cut it and its the governments role to start massively reducing emissions. Obviously we will need countries like the US to fall in line and do the same for any meaningful global impact.Yes forget climate crises, pandemics, and economic meltdowns. We need validation for our plutocratic president.I\u2019m with you 100%. Start slow with smart ideas. Things that feel almost no impact. Slowly get us of fossil fuel for transportation. Find better way to produce electricity. \n\nSounds like a bunch of new jobs to me. \n\nI don\u2019t know why we are going after carbon capture more. We could plant more trees like a lot more. We could start better farming practices. Non of this would have a huge impact on people lives. We don\u2019t even need to worry about cars yet. They are relatively low pollutersThese types of markets with exotic animals have existed for thousands of years and likely did cause pandemics in the past. Only difference is with flying and densely packed cities it spreads more quickly - if this happened in 1500 Wuhan and a couple other close cities would be the only ones affected. London had dozens of plagues in the 1300s to 1700s that didn\u2019t hit much of the rest of the worlddude, on one hand, you are a genius. On the other, I sadly think those people would take the money and get the vaccine but then lie and say they did neither and keep spreading the propaganda.\n\nThough at least they would be vaccinated then so it's like a 3/4ths win.How about vaccine darts shot from helecoptors.  Have you considered using the military to distribute the vaccines the same way we hunt wolves?Yeah, but those immunocompromised people are screwed whether or not I get my vaccine. I'll do my part, get my vaccine, and relish in the fact that I have 95% chance of being protected against the 70 million death cultists that have taken over our nationThat's what I meant.Problem is that you can't entirely finish a vaccine without a disease because you can't test it.  Still would have been nice to have them a bit more developed thoughYeah I don't agree with the protesters in the streets, I sympathise with people who have broken lockdown but not people who oppose it because \"freedom\"There is no sense comparing to estabilished diseases like measles that are firmly under control.\n\nUntil we get this under control (i.e. prevalence below the levels of flu etc.), I\u2019m positive conditional restrictions will be in place.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]True. I\u2019m a transplant patient, I take immunosuppressants. I have had the flu vaccine and Shingrix. As long as it\u2019s not a live virus I\u2019m okay. Not sure how a COVID vaccine would work in cases like mine.Let's not kid ourselves.\n\n\"Politically connected\" will be #1Yeah I understand what different arguments might be but I feel like healthcare workers should be first line because if we have no healthcare workers everyone else has no hopeHe's talking to a lay public, who would be more scared by the idea of a \"mutated\" vaccine than a modified one. This comment thread is about a lay public nervous about taking a vaccine.Yes but I guess the question was whether it poses a risk that a vaccine with severe side effects may end up on the market, and no that's not a problem with combining phase 2 & 3.No they aren't. You can invest financially in phase 3 and lose it all when the results come back less than favourable. A company doing phase 2 and 3 at the same time doesn't change the criteria that the FDA or other health authorities require to approve a vaccine.Hypothetically, if the world moved over to a mixture of green and nuclear energy would we need to reduce consumption?Yep I am on \"looking to which countries will weather it out better and have a higher chances of giving me residence\". I have no hope we will stop this disaster. I mean even if we stop now its going to be ugly. But we will not stop at all and it will be even worst than what it could be.Yeah, if we don\u2019t fix all this stuff I\u2019m starting to think we may all die somedayFascism is a good response to climate change for sureLike a real democracy, where the majority rules?Without any antivaxxers, we could be fairly certain that enough of the population would be immunised to practically eliminate community transmission; this would protect the immunocompromised. Ergo, the more people that refuse the vaccine, the greater risk of community transmission and the greater the risk to the immunocompromised.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][deleted]As the other commenter said, Pfeizer/BioNTech and Moderna are both safe for you.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a huge upside of the breakthrough on these RNA vaccinesoh no, the vaccine, it's mutating!All viruses are mutations anyway. The lay public are better off not drawing random conclusions or it'll put them off for no reason.It's a risk to the people in the trialMore drugs fail in phase 2 trials than phase 3 trials. Also phase 3 trials cost a lot more because of the scale of them is a lot larger.\n\nIt's potentially riskier to conduct large scale phase 2/3 combined trials and than that fail than to have something fail in a smaller phase 2 trial.YesThis is the strategy I'm going with.\n\nAlso trying to figure out how to squeak into the 1% before that door closes forever thanks to automation.The nuclear winters should balance everything out.I am legitimately worried about the potential of ecoterrorism causing a huge backlash. I hope that nobody's passion about climate makes them do anything rash over the next decade.I don\u2019t want to believe that it\u2019s our only option.  But if we keep waiting if probably will be.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Thank you!TruePhase 1 is for safety, there is no additional risk to patients to combine phases 2 and 3. There is only financial risk because you\u2019re recruiting a larger sample group to confirm statistically significant efficacy.Why?[removed][removed][removed][removed]Adverse effects are still identified in phase 2 and 3. \n\nPhase 1 is preliminary safety in healthy people. Phase 2 and 3 are when the drug candidate is actually given to people with the condition. Sometimes rarer effects need a larger sample size or more time to present themselves.",

    "Comments": "[removed]I also don't lock my liquor cabinet, or the cabinet where we store the household cleaners.[removed][removed]I don't believe this to be a good study. Or, at least not one demonstrating what the authors would like.\n\nThe people surveyed were at a \"gun safety event\" (no definition given) at various sporting goods stores (also no definition given). This group does not necessarily represent gun owners in general, and the group also likely skews highly towards people less likely to properly secure their firearms. Let me explain my reasoning:\n\nThe survey takes place at a \"gun safety event.\" Seasoned firearm owners are unlikely to attend an event* like this. \n\n* Firearm safety is an extremely static subject. With the exception of something like RFID user identification locking, the tenets and technology around gun security are relatively unchanged for the past century. Locking up guns, in safes that share designs with those produced decades ago, is not a continuing education exercise.\n\n* After a gun owner has in their possession more than a gun or two, security, not just for the safety of domestic persons, but to protect from theft, exponentially becomes a bugaboo. Longtime gun owners want to keep their collection safe, and would have taken steps to do so outside of an event like this.\n\n* The gun locks, or safety devices, that are given out at these kind of events, are almost always of extremely poor quality. They can sometimes be picked by children, have a very limited variation in keys or combinations, and offer almost no resistance to basic hand tools. Use of them can, in some cases, even damage the firearms they are securing or those adjacent. In some areas these are, by law, provided with each firearm purchase. Most gun owners are quite aware of the devices' limitations. \n\n\\* in reality, these are often not \"events\" in that they have a captive audience, but rather people handing out information and devices at a convenient location.\n\n> nearly all of the roughly 3,000 who submitted surveys said they planned to use the free safety device within the following week\n\nIf we are to believe the survey respondents, then it stands to reason that they are not and were not opposed to securing their firearms, but rather lacked the means or education to do so. Again, this group is self-selecting in that someone who believes that gun safety and security is important, would not participate in such an event's activities.\n\nSo, the study may very well be excluding a large contingent of gun owners, and if so it's exacerbated by said gun owners also owning a disproportionate number of guns. Throw on top of this many gun owner's reluctance to self-report *anything* and you don't have a good representative subject group.\n\nNow, proper firearm safety and security in our society definitely need to be improved upon, and the numbers in this article could just as likely be under-reported as over-reported, but I don't believe they are indicative of any significant findings.I didn't see any mention of if they accounted for things like people who carry a pistol. It could skew a lot of numbers if they just ask \"do you lock all the guns up?\" and people say no, and the context that they don't because the pistol is in a holster doesn't get included even though it's not quite the same as just leaving a pistol on the table.[removed][removed]This was posted earlier, along with some similar statements: \" I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of preventing them, but a matter of determining how many accidents you find acceptable in society. \"\n\nSo, how many fatal gun accidents are there?\n\nTo put this into perspective, there are about 32,000 (thirty two THOUSAND) fatal car accidents a year in the US.\n\nThere are about 500 accidental gun deaths each year in the US. Even though MILLIONS of new guns enter circulation each year, the rate of accidental gun deaths has been dropping for decades, and is at or near record lows now.\n\nHow many accidental gun deaths to children to age 14?\n\nAbout 50 a year. A while back I reviewed CDC data on unintentional external causes of death (accidents) to kids to age 14.\n\n1.2% of those were gun-related.\n\nWhile every accidental death is a tragedy, especially when it is a child, we do need to keep the magnitude of the problem in perspective.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]I find it difficult to find a balance between storing it somewhere safe and having it accessible enough so you can get it at 3 am when you hear someone coming up the stairs.[removed][deleted]I think the idea is that if you lock up your gun it will take too long to get if you need it in an emergency.My dad is very into guns, has been before I was born. The one thing he's always been strict about is gun safety, guns in the safe and those that weren't in the safe had trigger locks on them, any time he let me shoot with him he taught me how to properly handle the weapon.[removed]When I was 12, I would go roaming through the woods. My mother would tell me \"take my gun\" so I would go out to the woods with a .38 pistol on my hip. I looked like an old West gunslinger. I shot my first rifle when I was six. I'm thinking that these gun owners don't lock up their household guns around their kids because they expect their kids to be cognizant of gun safety. If they're good parents they would have taught them gun safety.Just like drugs and sex, if you keep them uninformed, they make uninformed decisions.[removed]This isn\u2019t a problem if the child knows the potential danger of said weapon. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nTreating it like a dirty topic is what makes it dangerous.[removed][removed]How is this related to science?You people cry and piss your pants over any headline that\u2019s firearm related. Gun owners don\u2019t secure *every single* firearm because some of them are intended for home defense.Notice how they said all guns. Lots of people have all but one or two guns locked in a safe.  It makes sense to have a gun near your bed or in a living area so you don't have to run to your safe fine the keys and load your gun when there's an intruder. Granted those guns should be well hidden and out of reach from anyone young enough to not understand them.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]A lot of states don\u2019t have laws about locking up guns around kids. It\u2019s probably a lot higher than 40%. As others have pointed out, this study isn\u2019t great.Guns were never locked up in my house, never a single problem. You knew better.Anyone who went through gun safety (requirement if under 18 in my state), knows safety classes are about safely operating a gun and not storage.If a child is raised around guns that are in the open then they are not taboo they have less interest in messing with them. \n\nThey're idiot Friends that come over on the other hand...Teach your kids to shoot, teach them weapons discipline and how to handle a gun safely. Problem solved.If you have a gun for home defense, having it unloaded and locked in a safe is pointless.\n\nI'd like to see the survey because how the question is phrased can influence the outcome. For example, perhaps the gun owner doesn't have children but when children are over they do not secure their gun because the child is constantly supervised. Or perhaps they keep the gum in an area inaccessible to the child.40% probably dont have kids...What's the percentage for those with kids and the percentage for those without? Seems pretty important to separate those two statistics.If people find this surprising they are out of touch.\n\nThat's not an insult, Gun safes are expensive, bulky, and impractical for home defense, gun locks are often so weak any determined attacker can get the gun unlocked on their own let alone a youtube video to help them and yet again the safer hey are the less practical for home defense. The most practicl solution is to intoduce your kids to the guns in the house explain to them plainly the consequences for unsupervised contact with the weapons and give them the opportunity to fire them and learn more about gun safety at a nearby range or on some land out of the city with a good back stop and permission from the owner.Personally, I wouldn't lock up a gun if I were to own one. I would teach my kids what it is and how it's not a toy. Yes I would keep if out of their sight/reach during times were I could, but locking up your form of defense kind of ruins the point of having a form of defense imo.Locking all household guns isn't gun safety anymore than it's necessary to lock all <insert potentially dangerous item here>.  Teaching and training your kids is.A lot of people who buy a gun do so for personal protection which means buying a gun safe is a secondary objective. So if you have kids and no gun safe the first thing to do is explain what it is and why it shouldn\u2019t be touched.Just about everyone has a knife block on their counter, too. So what?My guns are in a safe except for a couple.   My daughter has had her own 22 since she was young.   She\u2019s known gun safety and hunter safety long before she was in high school.   Only time guns get locked up is when her friends come over.   If I was 1% worried about her mental state it wouldn\u2019t be like that.   But I grew up in rural America and I had my first gun at 6.    Toy guns weren\u2019t allowed because gun safety comes firstBet you the access to hazardous chemicals and poisons is higher.[deleted]Yeah. Maybe we teach our kids about guns and how to not use them as toys. So they understand the gravity of it. If you don\u2019t trust people to own guns; do you also trust people enough to vote?My kids were naturally curious.  I bought a Beretta Neos for them and told them it was their gun.  Only to be used with me around and at the range.  Still would lock up everything up except my nightstand gun at night.  It's great to teach kids, but it's even better to always account for Murphy's Law.\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we need to take the guns away from the other 60% too!\u201d \n\nCmon, give us your guns, what are you afraid of?Are you supposed to keep all your guns locked? I have no kids, but I keep my gun loaded under my bed and easily accessible, I don\u2019t want to be fiddling around with locks if and when I ever have to actually use it.What does \"around kids\" mean here?\n\nTeaching children proper gun safety is more effective than just locking them (should do both though) - but below a certain age teaching won't be effective and above a certain age, locking won't be effective.[removed][removed][deleted][removed]I grew up around guns, it\u2019s not difficult to set boundaries and live without a safe.Proper safety talks with your children prevents most accidentsDid this study specify between \"locked gun\" aka a gun lock on the trigger or \"locked up gun\" as in locked in a safe? That's a pretty important distinction that should be made. I keep all my guns locked in safes that have finger print scanners keyed to me and only me, but I don't use trigger locks at all. My guns are kept perfectly safe from my children while still quickly and easily accessible to me in an emergency situationThat's less than half.  I don't lock any of my guns, but i don't have kids.  If i did i would until they were old enough to be taught safety.  Then i would no longer lock them up[removed][removed]My Dad never locked up his rifle, but he hid the bullets on a high shelf. And I still would have gotten in major trouble for touching the rifle. (Though I remember opening up the closet door to look at it.)Growing up my dad had rifles in the garage unloaded but with ammo nearby in boxes where we could\u2019ve easily loaded them. Unlocked. I never rly did anything with the guns. When I was 12 I went and held them and looked at them but I knew how to load them already and where the trigger was and what not to do with it because when I was 10 we went to a farm and he taught me how to shoot a pistol and then he taught me the force behind a shotgun when we shot skeet. I wasn\u2019t really anxious to pick up a rifle for a while after that. They bought me a cheap bow and some arrows to shoot at a foam block in the garage. Was fun. Now my younger brother which is an adult sleeps with a shotgun under his bed and we have a 10 year old younger brother that runs around the house. We taught him about guns and he knows not to touch it. He has his nerf guns to run around and shoot his friends with in the neighborhood. I think it\u2019s about how you are taught with guns and parents shouldn\u2019t keep these things from you. My parents tried to keep me from things and it just made me want them more. My dad finally let me have a taste of beer and I decided I didn\u2019t like it at 18 so I stayed away from it for a few more years. Knowledge is power. Don\u2019t hold your kids back, keep them informed about what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and teach them WHY they should and shouldn\u2019t do something. Teach them why guns are dangerous and how to handle them so when they do finally pick up a gun they know not to swing it around like a moron and shoot their friends with it.Tip: Utah has a state-backed rebate program up to $100 for buying a gun safe right now.I work retail and I had an older couple come through my line once who said they literally have a loaded gun hidden in every room in case of intruders. I worry about their grandchildren.Odd. \n\n\"and 14% stored all guns unlocked and loaded.\"Yo that\u2019s an airsoft gunFunny how the country thats supposedly the best, most free country is also so unsafe that everyone has to keep guns at home.As a gun and kid owner I can say I do lock one of them up.If you teach your kid that guns are dangerous and don't leave it in places where they could find it or reach it like a closet shelf for example, you should be fine. Also NEVER leave said gun loaded and always keep the gun and it's ammunition in separate places unless it's for self defense.How the hell are you supposed to lock up all your guns / ammo when the purpose of self defense is for them them to be readily accessible in the worst case scenario i.e. a home invasion. \nDo you truly think an armed robber will give you fools time to assemble your weapon after entering your safe code in the dark, loading a magazine with ammunition, then racking it back and finding that sucker who is nuts deep in your house at this point. \nTeaching children firearm safety and how to use them is much more important / practical / helpful.\u201cNot locking\u201d does not equate to accessible by kids.And this is the crowd probably most likely to lock guns. If self reported then 40% is probably low.[removed]Grew up with 3 siblings, Dad never owned a safe until we were all grown and moved out. Guns were placed in the house, loaded, and we were all familiar with them and how they worked. We knew they were there should we need them and also knew they were not to be played with. I do not have kids so I have several around the house. That being said, when we have nieces and nephews over I put all the guns in our bedroom and lock the door because I know they are not around guns often, if at all. I have a safe but that is only for the guns not in a defensive role.[removed]Kids can also access power tools, car keys, household poisons, and knives in the vast majority of American households. According to CDC\n\n>Every day, over 300 children in the United States ages 0 to 19 are treated in an emergency department, and two children die, as a result of being poisoned. It\u2019s not just chemicals in your home marked with clear warning labels that can be dangerous to children.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/safechild/poisoning/index.html\n\nDo the math and *this is 730 kids dying a year from just one common household item.* \n\nSo, how many kids die from negligent discharges? According to USA Today, Oct. 14, 2016, the rate is closer to one death ever other day, or **one-quarter the rate of unintended poisoning deaths of children.**\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/14/ap-usa-today-gun-accidents-children/91906700/\n\nFirearms do not crack the top 10 for causes of unintentional deaths for U.S. citizens (all ages considered). See https://webappa.cdc.gov/cgi-bin/broker.exe\nFirearms are in the bottom of the top 10 for unintended cause of death for children aged 5-24, but *you never see the top five cause on the front page of Reddit, you never see legislation requiring knives, and poisons, and hammers, and circular saws being locked into safes with criminal penalties or non-compliers, you never see people finger waggle at the owners of these items as being implicitly evil, you don't have Bloomberg spending millions of dollars on anti-poison campaigns.*\n\nIf you have children aged 5-24, you need to teach them about guns, what they are, how they work, etc. When kids are taught to just \"walk away\" from a gun, research has shown that they almost invariably pick up the gun out of curiosity. It has the success rate of \"just say no\" and \"abstinence only\" sex education. Kids need to know how to safely handle guns. If you have guns and kids, you need to educate them. \n\n**And by all means, lock up the guns, but what percentage of owners of household poisons don't lock up their poisons in secure safes? What percentage of homeowners lock up the lawnmower, or the sawsall, or the steak knives, or hammers, or hot glue gun, or swimming pool?**how is it an issue since we hear so few gun incidents in households compared to number of guns possessed by so many families ?  aren't there more gun fights/massacres than incidents involving children ? seems like a non issue.Yes let me lock away all my guns so that I can\u2019t have quick access to one when necessary. Liberal logic 101But Freakonomics says swimming pools are *way* more dangerous than handguns. Isn't that what we should be focusing on, locking up swimming pools? It's just one of the ostensibly brilliant man-bites-dog counterintuitive stories in this **new york times** **best-selling** work of non-fiction. I mean, how could they be wrong when they've even got an NPR podcast now?For every one kid that kills themselves with their parents gun, there are 1,000 who don\u2019t because they were taught betterWait... so people recommend locking ALL guns?  \n\nDoesn\u2019t that defeat the purpose of having a single handgun for home security?  I don\u2019t want to be fumbling for a key while my gf is being assaulted downstairs.Hold on Mr. Felon while I undo my state mandated 3-lock system...\n\nThe lock picking lawyer also proves almost all these locking devices suck. Best to talk to anyone in the home and go over the gun talk.Yah I assume alot of those are secured on their hip or within reach for home defense which is just logical.Some people teach their kids to respect guns,  some teach them to fear them.I made the decision not to buy a firearm until they were 12 & 15. I bought it. Brought it home. Showed them how it worked. Taught then Cooper\u2019s rules. Then took them to the range for a few hours.  They gained respect for the firearms and never bothered it. \n\nNo kid truly understands what a firearm can do until they shoot one. \n\nOf course people leave their guns unlocked. A gun that is locked, unloaded in a safe is useless for self defense. Does this include people who lock their ammo instead? I swear people on Reddit act like the ammo is in the chamber 24/7, like a video game. \n\n I wonder if people lock up their kitchen knives with their older kids.Very poor study controls, this reads of bias or extremely amateur selection process[removed][removed]My father is a former Marine, truck driving, deer hunter and gun enthusiast. He had my boys out on the range learning how to shoot since they were big enough to hold a gun. They understand that guns can and will load them selves if they think you aren't paying attention. They know how to check if it's loaded, know if the safety is on or off and they know how to hit a target. The problem is people who get guns and maybe shoot a couple of rounds at a gun range when they get it then treat it like a scary, mysterious object that makes it exciting to children. Learning proper gun safety and understanding the functions and workings of a gun makes them much less dangerous and much less likely to hurt or kill them selves or others. People who buy a gun and think it makes them Billy Badass. Those are the idiots that \"accidentally,\" kill someone.Did the survey include any questions about gun safety education for those who have children in the home? Because that's a relevant qualifier. The implication of this study appears to be that they're putting those children in danger, but there is a huge difference between \"I don't lock my guns up around kids because whatever\" and \"Gun safety education is an important part of my parenting.\"One cannot defend the homestead with a locked gun!?!?I don't have kids, and if I need a gun having it locked up doesn't do me any good. Why wood I lock every gun that I have?[removed]This really isn\u2019t a very problematic thing so long as you instill into your children the idea that guns are not toys, and that they must treat them accordingly. Also the big three rules\n\n1) NEVER touch the trigger unless you plan to completely destroy/kill what the gun is pointed at\n2) NEVER allow the gun to be pointing towards something that you don\u2019t intend to completely destroy/kill\n3) ALWAYS treat a gun as if it is loaded, even if you know with 100% certainty that is is empty, because it is very easy to be wrong.\n\nIf your children are scared of guns, then they will not be able to act responsibly with them. If you talk to them about guns, what to do if they see/find one, and how dangerous they can be if improperly handled, they will learn to use them safely.\n\nThe issue arises when you realize that some people will not teach their children about the guns they own.This is why NRA recommends you always have a backup child.If an intruder breaks into your house at night you're not going to have time to fiddle around with locks and safes.To anyone that argues lack of safety here realize there are estimated to be 120 guns per 100 people in America.  Most gun owners do not lock their guns away anymore than they would lock their ovens or lock their knives.  They have instructed children on how and what these things do and thats that.  If you do not own a gun, you have no idea what you are talking about.....[removed]The idea of having a home defense weapon ready to go means having it ready so you don't need to fumble with a lock while someone's breaking your door down. This is a stupid statistic.A locked gun protects no one. Teach your kids to respect guns.A home defense gun won't do you much good if it's not quickly and easily accessible when you need it.Well, this is pretty stupid. Guns don't just go off because they aren't in a safe. What if you want a gun at the ready in case you need it? The title also says \"all guns.\" If you have 10 guns in a safe and have one in your nightstand, this title implies you are irresponsible. \n\nAnd before people mention kids, I'm obviously not saying leave them out on the kitchen table for them to be accessible to kids. The title says \"even around kids,\" which does not mean all owners surveyed have kids, nor does it specify the age of the kids.Where can I find a non liberal reddit page ? Take a break alreadyI don't lock my knives up, nor do I look up my the nail gun that has killing power as well, you don't need to lock up everything.I have a gun with children and I keep it unlocked. I have a gun for personal protection of my household and it\u2019s rendered useless if it takes me 30 seconds to unlock it. If someone is in your house you don\u2019t have the time to go to it, unlock it, and arm it. I do have it anchored in the top of the closet to where you have to lift up to unhook it, so it would take a ladder for a kid to get to it, but it is unlocked.Unless you have a large house and you're sleeping on the second floor, it is a bad idea to keep your home defense gun locked in safe.I have no kids in my household, so I do not worry about it.  Everyone in the household knows where they are when they need them.\n\nIn the FEW times kids are going to be around, I put them away safely.My guns aren't locked in a safe, but they are stored out of general vision and the ammo is secured. However my children have had gun safety drilled into them for years and are proficient in handling them. Education is a far better deterrent to stupidity than false security ever will be.\n\nEdited because my first sentence was gibberish thanks in part to autocorrect and lack of proofreading.My pistol is only in my safe when my daughters are there. They're the only kids that come over so it's not a big deal to leave it out any other time.Safety's on as good as gone, amirite?Does this number include guns out of the reach of children or worn in a holster? Technically not locked, but also not accessible to the kids. Like if you put a gun on a shelf where a kid can't see it or reach it, but an adult can.If this includes the pistol some people keep in their nightstand for ease of access for a possible night time intrusion then this doesn\u2019t mean much.Why are they showing an airsoft gun in that picture?Clearly 60% of gun owners don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re for then.I'm just surprised it was only 40%.  The people I know who own guns try to keep them available as possible, otherwise doesn't that kind of defeat the point?My dad doesn\u2019t because he knows he can trust us not to do anything with them unless supervised.Guessing this is in the USA where that's not the UK where you're required by law to store guns separate from their ammo and behind a locked door in a locked safe. Guns aren't an issue in my opinion, rather the availability on who gets them and the legislation on safety measures. A quick comparison of the gun crime rates in the UK vs US is good evidence of this. Regardless of legislation everyone should carry out good practice.[removed]Securing the firearms is half of the safety plan.  Educating the kids is the other half.One of the main issues is teenagers/pre teens. More and more studies are showing that teenagers from first thinking about suicide to acting on it- often happens in less that 5 minutes. If a safe slows down their access to a firearm, they are more likely to reconsider suicide to reach out to a peer. \n\nLocks and safes in use WITH proper education on gun handling is the safest prevention you can take to protect your children (outside of not owning a firearm).Which means you should buy a decent safe.[removed]he picked one open with a lego!!![removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Devil's advocate here, did all of these people know they were going to receive free storage from an event *before* purchasing and not safely storing said weapons?It\u2019s not a scientific study, it\u2019s a public policy study.\n\nThe goal of the study is obviously to highlight the importance of the groups own stance that they are needed.\n\nBoth those being said it\u2019s not really a good fit for this sub, the sample size and methodology don\u2019t make for a good generalized statistic.\n\nThe law was recently changed in Washington that criminalizes having guns unlocked and accessible.\n\nSo this is part of a push to help Gun owners meet those new requirements free of charge.\n\n\u201cOwners who keep their firearm in a lock box or safe, or who use a trigger lock, wouldn\u2019t be subject to charges if the gun was somehow accessed by a prohibited person. Nor would the law apply if a person barred from having a firearm obtains one due to unlawful entry, provided the owner reports the theft within five days of the time she or he knew or should have known it happened.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/new-washington-gun-regulations-become-law-as-resistance-hangs-over-initiative-1639/Also of note, many people CCW which means a gun is purposefully not locked, but instead on person.I was at this event in the photo, and you are spot on with your assessment. I happened to be there getting fishing supplies that day.\n\nThey handed out free trigger locks and cable locks that were incredibly cheap. No experienced gun owners would ever be drawn to a giveaway of something like this.It's also important to know that, by law*, all guns sold in the United States come with a free safety device and they are almost nearly never used because they are junk.\n\nIf people have guns, they have gun locks.\n\nUnless the \"safety device\" is a nice safe given for free, then they aren't giving people anything that they don't already have.\n\nEdit: This isn't federal law like I thought it was. It is state law in several states. That being said, 4 out of the 5 firearms that I own came with locks. The 5th was a lower receiver, so it was just a peice of aluminum when I picked it up. I don't know of any mainstream manufacturers that do not include them with handguns. Glock, Smith and Wesson, Ruger, CZ, and Sig all come with locks.[removed]Do you happen to have a direct link to the study, or is this based off of the abstract?You missed the point. Their conclusion is not a generalization about gun owners (see the title the of the study). It's a public health study about promoting gun safety education.\n\nFrom the article above: \n\n>What the participants reported emphasizes the need for these public events, Seattle Children\u2019s and University of Washington researchers say, because 40% of gun owners at the events reported having at least one firearm in their home that was not locked up. In addition, 39% of survey takers indicated they kept a loaded gun at home, and 14% stored all guns unlocked and loaded.\n\nThis is a study about the attendees of the gun safety events held by Seattle Children's. They found that a significant portion of attendees do not lock their guns. The study is here and it actually concerns itself with the characteristics of the people they reached.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743519304359\n\n>Community-based firearm safety interventions are an important component of a multi-faceted, public health approach to reducing firearm injuries in the U.S. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of characteristics of individuals who attend such events and factors that may influence their firearm storage practices. This information can be used to tailor intervention content, improve effectiveness, and reach potentially high-risk populations. In this study, which includes data from nearly 3000 participants in 10 community-based firearm safety events occurring in Washington state from 2015 to 2018, we sought to [1] characterize the sociodemographic characteristics and firearm safety practices of event participants; and [2] assess whether the presence and age of children in the household are associated with firearm storage practices\n\nIf you would like to read the full article, PM me.As a counter argument though, this study could be skewed in the opposite direction. The one uniting factor among all these people attending gun safety events is that they actually care enough about gun safety to attend such an event. This is not the majority of gun owners, as you said, these are the gun owners who specifically want to be more safe with guns. Because they are concerned with gun safety they are likely to have taken more precautions than people who believe that they already have adequate gun safety skills and devices.> Firearm safety is an extremely static subject\n\n1. Treat all guns as if they are loaded.\n2. Do not point a gun at anything you do not wish to destroy.\n3. Know your target and what lies beyond it.\n4. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire.\n\nHonorable mention:\n\n- All unlawful firearms were lost in a tragic boating accident.I mean compounding on this, I'll store the majority of my guns where a kid can't easily get to them, but a locked up gun is kind of useless in the event of a burglary. It'd be like locking the kitchen cabinets to stop kids from getting in there, and storing the fire extinguisher in the locked cabinet. It's not going to help you if you can't access it. \n\nAnd it's not like I want to walk around my own house with a pistol on my hip. It's in a quickly and easily accessible drawer. More importantly, you drill the kids on safety and how it's not a toy; eliminate the mystery and fun and exotic nature of the tool so they treat it with about as much curiosity as the table saw. First it's \"It's not a toy, you can get hurt.\" and later, as they mature, you teach them safe handling.\n\n>  proper firearm safety and security in our society\n\nI'm with you there on the safety, but it's also very much a personal matter that really isn't anyone else's business. It'd be nice to have some standards on safety and best practices, but we've seen globally how quickly such things become abused. California started off pushing \"Safety\" with storage laws, and it devolved in only 20 years into confiscation squads that will kick in your door on the thinnest excuse, you can't own any semi-auto pistol newer than 2009 models, and you can't even buy ammo legally half the time because their \"background check\" system is down.\n\nSuch frameworks, even if the initial cause is noble, without fail, lead to abuse.[removed][removed]I don't have kids, and I don't keep my gun locked away, but if kids are coming over to my place I absolutely make sure the gun is secured.[removed]The surveys had questions about \"other household information\" and one about if guns were locked up. I'm assuming that you don't get published if you lump everyone who has kids in with those who don't and then look at how many guns aren't locked up.[removed][removed]I think that the comparison to cars is easily brushed off.\n\nDrowning is a better comparison.\n\nAbout 10 people die per day in non-boating related drowning incidents. The swimming pool in your back yard is far more likely to kill your child than your gun.\n\nGun safety is important, but it isn't the epidemic that is being disningenously presented.When we demystify the weapon, I'd bet many of those unintentional deaths drop more.   \n\nI fired a gun one time at a gun range, I never need to play with a real gun again, I've wanted to fire the gun more times at a safe and controlled gun range though.[deleted]Also, if we lowered the speed limit to something like 15 mph and strictly enforced it, we could almost eliminate traffic deaths, but as a society we have decided getting places faster is more important then saving lives....>\" I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of preventing them, but a matter of determining how many accidents you find acceptable in society. \"\n\nThis fundamentally has to relate to the actual purpose of the activity in society, yes?\n\nWhen you say 32,000 (it's actually 40,231 as of 2017) fatal motor vehicle traffic deaths, that provides some context for accidental causes of death, but...motor vehicles are ubiquitous in America, and if we waved a magic wand (and to be clear to people who are sensitive about gun ban talk, I do mean a magic wand. Legislation isn't a magic wand.) and removed all motor vehicles from the country tomorrow, society as we know it would collapse in *days*. Tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions would starve to death.\n\nI mean, unintentional falls accounted for 36,338 deaths in 2017, but...what are we going to do to prevent falls? Suggest people not stand? \n\nVery misleadingly, studies exist showing that medical errors cause hundreds of thousands of deaths per year (misleading because the relevant stat there is more nuanced than death. QALY cost would probably be a more reasonable stat and make it seem much less severe a problem. Very ill people are easy to kill by accident.) Should we advise people not to go to the doctor?\n\nWith guns, it becomes a different discussion, because guns are completely unnecessary to life for the overwhelming majority of people (subsistence hunters being the only exception I can think of. And how many of those are there, really?). People might argue self-defense, but...that doesn't hold up under scrutiny, being that owning guns doesn't actually seem to make people any safer. (Also, if anyone starts talking about overthrowing tyrannical governments, I'm going to direct them to some mental health information..)\n\nTo be charitable to firearms, I might compare it to swimming, which sees an average of ~3500 unintentional (non boat related) drownings per year. That's a less-than-necessary activity for the overwhelming majority of people. \n\nBasically all other activities are significantly lower in risk than firearm accidents. All forms of sharp objects combined (cutting and puncturing), all forms of machinery combined, etc. So if you're unconcerned about your child getting into your guns, you should be *really* unconcerned about them getting into your knives, the lawnmower, power tools, etc....at least statistically.  \n\nTo beat out firearms in risk of accidental death among children, you need to essentially be talking about cars (which are the top by a huge margin) or what are entertainingly best grouped as elemental forces: Drowning (water), burning (fire), suffocation (air). Poisoning and falls (arguably earth, but that's slightly grasping) sometimes also beat firearms depending on the age bracket.\n\nI'd also probably mention that while deaths as a method of comparison is...as valid as anything else...When considering absolute risk, you should also include injuries. Being killed is bad, being maimed still isn't great.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that *unintentional* deaths are not the only reason to secure your firearms. Even around children. Once you include homicide and suicide, those stats **skyrocket**.  (And no, someone who is suicidal *won't* always find another way to kill themselves just because they can't access a gun. It's very usually an impulsive decision made in a moment of distress. The means available matter.)\n\n>How many accidental gun deaths to children to age 14? About 50 a year.\n\nI assume you mean \"age 14 *and under*\", otherwise that would be *staggering*. (Also, I know the stats, and know that that's not true, haha)\n\nIn 2017, unintentional firearm deaths accounted for:\n\nAge 0-4: 31\n\nAge 5-9: 14\n\nAge 10-14: 16\n\nSo 61 total for that year in particular. Most of them toddlers.\n\nI'll also point out:\n\nAge 15-24: 117.\n\nWhich might inform some people's choices and understanding of risks.\n\nI'm not making a specific argument here, overall, but if we're presenting stats for consideration, I think yours don't paint a complete picture (and none do), and want to contribute to the food for thought.Yeah, I can definitely see the case if you are not keeping a gun for home defense a breach lock is cheap and reasonably effective to deter unmotivated attacks. However your right to defend yourself should not take a back seat to something which is a borderline non-issue. \n\nIf we wish to reduce gun violence, it would be worthwhile to make the background check system publicly funded and available to private sellers, and once it is widely available, mandatory for private sales. Obviously reducing income inequality and improving access to healthcare mitigates crime of all forms. Far too many gun control measures seem to be concocted to punish lawful or prospective lawful owners, or to disenfranchise the lower class by restricting their capacity for violence.The question which should come up on the gun debate as it is the crux of many arguments is - how many deaths are acceptable as a society due to this cause?\n\nBefore people rush to tell me that it should be zero, I'll remind you that every single part of society has an acceptable number of fatalities associated with it. It's why we still allow cars on the road, why we still drink alcohol and are making moves to legalise even more drugs, it's why we can eat unhealthy food, to be honest it's the reason we're allowed to go outside. All of those kill people but we a society accept it as a necessary evil. To my knowledge all of those kill more than guns in total before we account for the majority of gun deaths being suicides and other subdivisions of the data. \n\nBut that question is never asked, the actual real data on guns and gun deaths is rarely cited, and all too often people will be demanding an emotional kneejerk reaction rather than taking a measured, data-driven response.You can use the CDC Wonder tool to query the 2017 data set on mortality (see wonder.cdc.gov, I used the detailed mortality dataset).\n\nIn 2017, I queried by state and age for deaths coded as W32 (other causes of accidential injury, exposure to inanimate mechanical forces, handgun discharge), W33 ( Rifle, Shotgun, and larger firearm discharge) and W34 (discharge from other and unspecified firearms)...\n\nThere were 486 deaths total (0.1 per 100,000 population).\n\nLess than 1 year: 1\n\n1-4 years old: 31 (0.2 per 100k)\n\n5-14 years old: 30 (0.1 per 100k)\n\n15 - 24 years old: 117 (0.3 per 100k)\n\n25 - 34 years old: 93 (0.2/100k)\n\n35 - 44 years old: 64 (0.2/100k)\n\n45 - 54 years old: 50 (0.1/100k)\n\n55 - 64 years old: 47 (0.1/100k)\n\n65 - 74 years old: 30 (0.1 / 100k)\n\n75 - 84 years old: 18\n\n85+ 5\n\nSo accidential shootings are very, very small in a country of 325 million.\n\nFor comparison:\n\nX33 victim of lightning: 19 deaths\n\nV02 and V04 pedestrians injured in collision with 2 or 3 wheeled motor vehicle, heavy transport vehicle or bus: 326 deaths\n\nAlcohol induced causes: 35,823\n\nSo, by data, we should take 100% of the money spent on locking up guns and spend it all on locking up alcohol. Just saying.[deleted][removed]As long as you do not see them as mutually exclusive. The lock also helps with your kid's idiot friends who may not have gotten that education.Gun-proof your kids, don't try and kid-proof your guns.[removed][removed][removed][removed]Yes, you can choose not to have a gun in the house for protection. If you do, but you lock them up, they may as well not be for protection, but for strictly sport. You\u2019re not going to have much time in a real emergency situation.\n\nIf you do have a gun in the house for protection reasons, it is ABSOLUTELY your responsibility to make sure your kids not only know about it, but understand what can go wrong and how it can go wrong. \n\nI know a lot of people are sensitive to the idea of bringing kids to the range to learn at a young age, and while I think this is the best option because it can also preemptively reduce their curiosity, it\u2019s not 100% necessary. Just please teach your kids as much as you canAlso, if I have a gun for self defense in my home why would I have it locked up. Theres an Australian comedian who does a great bit on this, I just cant remember his name.\n\nedit:  Jim Jeffrey's, go take a watch its hilarious and brings up a good pointThis is exactly why I think we should teach gun safety in school.  Just a couple days, go over basic function and how to handle a gun safely.  It would probably save a few kids lives.Exactly. My dad had several guns around the house in plain view and us kids NEVER touched them. We knew the damage they could do, we knew that they weren\u2019t toys, and we knew we\u2019d get our ass tore up if we did.I don't see a definition for \"locked up.\" There are varying levels of security when it comes to storing firearms, and there may be a lower level for different firearms in the house, notably in a bedroom.Kids can find anything. A small bedside safe with a 4 digit code can be unlocked in seconds, gun can be loaded and ready to go.I disagree. They're waiting \"for free firearm storage devices.\" So they're people who haven't been locking up their guns and now want to be, most likely. If you already lock up your guns then you're not showing up for the free storage or the survey they give you before it.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Information and education is the best safety tool.[removed][removed]wasnt gun education an actual thing in the public school system in the 20th centruy? as well as driving[removed][removed][removed][removed]Shhhh. Your talking about education.  Someone might get offended.Stop.\nDon't touch.\nLeave the area.\nTell an adult.Why is this so hard for some people to understand?[removed]Yeap. When I was a kid, my brother and I always played with cap guns which my dad always said treat it like a real gun and never point even a toy gun at anyone. Before I was born or my siblings my dad gave his guns away to our uncle who was a gun dealer as well to hold onto his guns until we were older and didn\u2019t have to worry about us getting into them.Ignorance is not blissThere are some jokes you just don't do such as pointing a gun at someone.We never had gun locks as kids.  We would however have caught the belt if we touched them without our parents there.  We were also taught early about how to act around firearms.  Just like we were warned to not drink poison, touch a stove, light matches without an adult...My grandfather did this for me with cap guns. He said to never point my toy gun at anyone, never know if it's a real gun. An unlikely scenario, but it worked.Stop! Don't touch! Leave the area! Tell an adult![removed][removed][removed][removed]That\u2019s what my dad did. He took us outside, we lived on acreage and he told us to look at the gun he had in his hand. He said it was dangerous and to never touch it, then he said to cover our ears. Then he shot an old metal trash can and it disintegrated. He may have shot it a few times. We never played with his guns, he just kept them in his closet.Bingo.  My children grew up around guns.  Every time they see one we talk about the safety rules, what to do, what not to do.  \n\nI also understand that no matter how safely I store my firearms, one day they could be at a friends house and hear, \u201chey want to see my dad\u2019s gun?\u201d.\n\nWhile no parent can 100% predict how their child might respond, I am confident that with my kids the \u2018cool factor\u2019 has been removed and also that they know how to properly handle a firearm and why.You should make it clear that theres nothing cool about this kind of stuff, i had a conversation or 2 about drugs with my little cousin and i always try to make drugs look uncool so he loses interrestBut why should I have to parent a kid when I can just complain and ruin it for others?Eddie the Eagle!We just went out and watched a watermelon get shot by a hand gun. It\u2019s super neat and after we tried to do the same damage with our bare hands. I still remember that 30ish years later.Shoot it in front of them. No joke. It gives them a healthy respect for the danger. A kid that knows guns is *less* likely to play with them.First thing I did when I brought my shotgun home.  Everyone say and talked gun safety and kids were told of they see it out, or any shells, they don't touch and get an adult.Because knowing is half the battle.My dad showed me where and how all his guns worked. Even with the anonimity of the internet I can say I never went behind his back and grabbed any of his guns.Same thing as a car, or pesticides, or 100 other things. At some point you can't save your kids from danger unless you educate them.My dad made it a point to teach me and my sisters gun safety and made it clear they they were never to be touched unless he was present. The first rule in handling a firearm was to clear the chamber even if the person handing you the gun said they just checked it and it was fine. If you didn't do that, away they went and whatever plans we had for them were cancelled. It instilled good practice for me as an adult. Guns aren't scary if you aren't afraid of them.Never too soon, honestly.Bingo.My father is a gunsmith.  Avid semi-professional marksman in his day.   Small arsenal of both historical and modern firearms in my basement the entire time I was growing up. Had a loaded gun stashed in the front hall closet.  \n\nHe taught me respect for firearms very very young. I learned to shoot at 7. That came with education. A firearm is not a toy.  It is not to be played with. It is one thing that can deal out death which has no reversal once done. And now as an adult i have a healthy respect but also fear of firearms. Because you need some fear.  Once the fear is gone you become reckless. I have a five year old to which I plan on doing the same lessons. \n\nTalking to children about the weight of responsibility that comes with owning guns should be a no brainer.My parents never had guns, but my next door neighbor\u2019s parents had guns. I specifically remember one day I was over at their house playing, and the dad took us out in the garage and pointed to his gun safe. He told us to never, ever go near it, and we were never, ever to pick up or touch a gun. Now we had no inclinations to try to get into it, but I definitely knew it was not kid stuff, it was not a toy.mines almost 4 and he seems to understand that you never ever point them at people. Now he just has to figure out what a real gun is and whats a toy.Even if you don\u2019t own guns or never intend to own one people should be educated about proper handling of a weapon.Yup. If you're going to own guns, assume that safety mechanisms (safes and trigger locks) will only stop accidents. Malicious intent is something entirely different, and that's much more on the education side.\n\nEdit: safes, not wages. Thx autocorrect.Even not owning one, guarantee your kid might have a friend who lives in a house with one. Still important to teach them, for the same reason teach them to swim.I and at least 4 of my friends would not be alive today if we'd had easy access to firearms. Every second that suicide is delayed decreases the chance of an attempt. \n\nDemystifying guns is a very good step to take when there are kids around, as well as teaching them proper safety and maintenance, but most semi-intelligent teens and pre-teens can figure out how to crack a basic lock. Using one that only you can unlock and/or keeping it in a place hard for a kid to reach adds on more time for a suicide to go from an attempt to an unfulfilled thought. Not even mentioning kids who want to pull pranks or 'just have a little fun' with dad's gun and end up accidentally killing someone>More and more studies are showing that teenagers from first thinking about suicide to acting on it- often happens in less that 5 minutes. \n\nThis doesn't just apply to teens. People usually commit suicide in a moment of crisis, it takes work to psych themselves up to it. The more barriers there are (like having to drive to a bridge) the less likely they will be to go through with it.\n\nThat's why gun control would cut down on suicides by such a large margin. No people wouldn't just find another way because guns are by far the simplest  and quickest option.Even these crappy safes would stop most children. LPL knows exactly what to look for and how to defeat these things; just because he shows a safe *can* be defeated with a thin strip of plastic he cut off an orange juice bottle, that doesn't mean every kid is going to get a shim and start stabbing around in the right place. Now, if your kid is looking at your safe and punching the exact model into YouTube to get LPL's channel to see how to defeat it, that's one thing, but then anything that can be defeated by something other than normal picking (an acquired skill) might as well be straight out.Real gun control would be providing citizens with good safes. Might cut down on burglary too. I know I keep all my valuables in a gun safe[removed][removed][removed][removed]Yes, because that\u2019s part of the goal of the event.\n\nThe law was recently changed in Washington that criminalizes having guns unlocked and accessible.\n\nSo this is part of a push to help Gun owners meet those new requirements free of charge.\n\n\u201cOwners who keep their firearm in a lock box or safe, or who use a trigger lock, wouldn\u2019t be subject to charges if the gun was somehow accessed by a prohibited person. Nor would the law apply if a person barred from having a firearm obtains one due to unlawful entry, provided the owner reports the theft within five days of the time she or he knew or should have known it happened.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/new-washington-gun-regulations-become-law-as-resistance-hangs-over-initiative-1639/More than likely that they knew. These events aren\u2019t usually a \u201csurprise gift\u201d type of thing. More of a \u201cattend a free safety seminar and get a free lock with this flyer\u201d kind of thing.You don\u2019t conceal carry your safe? You monster!Also a home defense weapon can be locked up when you're out of the house or during the day. But a locked up home defense weapon at night when you're laying in bed is no longer a home defense weapon, it's a useless paper shredder you keep locked in a vault. \n\n\nAt night, your firearm should be accessible within seconds, or it is not a home defense weapon and you're kidding yourself if you call it that. You'll never reach it in time. \n\n\n\nSo as a responsible gun owner, I too would admit to not having all my guns locked up. Most of them are, but not my handgun, that sits on my night stand.Federal law requires all HANDGUNS sold with a lock, not all firearms.\n  \nSome states (like California) require it for all firearms, but only some.[deleted]Obviously this is just anecdotal but, as someone who grew up around firearms and got their own .22 at about 10-12 years old, I\u2019ve seen far more responsible gun owners than irresponsible gun owners. You always hear about the irresponsible owners, but from what I\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re far outnumbered by those who care about safety and do everything possible to make sure those who are vulnerable are well educated and the firearms are kept and stored safely in case of an unforeseen accident.[removed]The point of the headline is to skew perspective. They didn't separate them in reporting on purpose.[removed]They did a whole study and produced this headline.\n\nLike most gun studies it is result driven and separating those groups would hurt their objective.[removed][removed]Better still is alcohol: ~90k deaths a year attributed to alcohol. If someone is more interested in stopping 500 deaths a year than they are 90,000 then, at the very least, their ability to think rationally is in question.>Gun safety is important, but it isn't the epidemic that is being disningenously presented.\n\nWell said.> I think that the comparison to cars is easily brushed off.\n> \n> Drowning is a better comparison.\n\nNo. Alcohol is the best comparison to gun because alcohol is not \"needed\" for society to function, just like anti gun people say guns aren't needed for society to function. America has around 75,000 alcohol related deaths per year which means 7,500,000 have died from alcohol in the last 10 years. Alcohol consumption is involved in 90% of domestic abuse cases and 60% of all crime in america is committed under the influence of alcohol. No one needs to get drunk. No one needs an assault pack of beer. No one need a gallon of hard liquor.\n\nAlcohol is much more detrimental to society than guns. We need to ban alcohol, oh wait, we already tried banning alcohol and it gave the mafia more money and power than they could have ever imagined.Everything the media says about firearms has been grossly exaggerated and has been for decades.  Almost as if there's an anti gun agenda or something.[removed]It is worth noting that homicide rates go up and down, for reasons poorly understood. Homicide, including gun homicide, peaked around 1991. Even though MILLIONS of new guns enter circulation each year (that is, every year there are more guns than ever before), by around 2015 the homicide rate, including gun homicide, had dropped about 40%.I remember accidental poisoning was a surprisingly high number when reviewing the data.I have a bit of compassion for anti-gun folks. Their opinions are rooted in fear, and it's not entirely their fault.\n\nThey often haven't had a reason to use firearms before, and the media biases the information they share towards what gets people to read or watch. So they have an \"availability bias\" in that the only kind of information they see is about accidents and catastrophes.\n\nPair that with their limited understanding of the weapons and honestly I can understand why they would be anti-gun. People usually don't have the time to actively go through every one of their fears or beliefs to reconsider it. These heuristics we develop used to keep us alive when we didn't have civilization and advanced technology, but, they no longer serve us so well.\n\nIn fact most of our political problems these days boil down to the different, unrealistic fears people have about one thing or another. There are gun fanatics that likewise have ridiculous fears about conspiracies to seize their weapons.There's not really a lot of accidental gun deaths. The vast majority of deaths caused by unsecured firearms is suicide.You will probably get a lot of hate-responses to your comment. But I agree with you.> but...motor vehicles are ubiquitous in America, \n\nThere are more guns than cars in America. You can look it up.Yup.   My parents were keen on tucking all the firearms away when I had friends over until they knew who they were dealing with.Many of these loaded firearms aren\u2019t really just out in the open, they are hidden for easy access. I know when I was a kid there were only a few guns in the house loaded that weren\u2019t locked up, but none were in places someone would accidentally look (or were impossible for a kid to reach).[removed][removed]Good comment right here. The responsibility is on the parent. My son is 12 and there is nobody I trust more to access my firearms.It's amazing how many times people will plea that ignorance leads to hate on issues about racism but refuse to believe it carries over. It applies to almost everything.[removed]This needs signal boosted hard: If you survey a bunch of people waiting in line for a drink if they're thirsty, your data is going to be busted.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Careful with that as they get older (not sure how young you mean when you say \u201clittle\u201d). That kind of thing is what made DARE fail. Don\u2019t lie to them. Dangerous, taboo things, for many people, *are* cool, even if they\u2019re not to you.\n\nExposure and education (of the bad *and good* or fun) are far better teachers. And much better they can do things like shoot guns or drink beer or smoke weed (not simultaneously) under adult supervision than alone with their friends who convinced them that those things are *super cool!*.We're encouraged to remove critical components from the firearm where possible here in Aus. E.g. bolt from rifle. Store it separately so if someone takes the rifle in a hurry or without understanding it there is more work to do to accidentally or intentionally harm.Yep, a responsible parent does both. This isn't an iPad where getting 30 more minutes of screentime is the consequence.Ironically those LPL videos are making these gun safes even less safe because 13yo's use reddit and YouTube- the two places these videos and tricks gain publicity.[deleted][removed][removed][removed]The only thing stopping a bad guy with a gun is a good guy standing on top of a building getting ready to drop a safe on him.[deleted]I'm pretty sure my Mossberg 500 came with a cheapo cable lock. And I am in Oklahoma. It is entirely possible that manufacturers follow the California guidelines like they do with most cars simply to streamline their processes l.Those cable locks are like $7 and usually come with the gun\n\nEven in the most lax jurisdictions in the deep south, your gun is probably coming with a lockI think you're \"clicks are much sexier\" comment sums it up quite well. There's no money in being ethical or sharing the truth. There's money in people reading your articles.\n\nScientists by and large are interested in the truth, however, they are trying to publish in a world where the publisher doesn't care about anything but how much money they're going to make. That means they won't be so successful in publishing information people need to see, but rather will be judged by the number of publications that have information people want in it.\n\nThat's why there is a reproducibility crisis.[removed]\u201cKids under the age of 18\u201d or \u201csmall children\u201d\n\nThe methodology of the question is very misleading[removed]The US did outlaw alcohol at one point.  Didn't work.But guns bad and scaryyeah but this wont sell on main media nobody is gonna vote for the president who says he/she is gonna stop drunk driving etc.The epidemic word is universally overused.Good point.\n\nAlcohol is also a great example of why prohibition doesn't work and would not work for firearms.IIRC the NSSF did a press release last year, stating (with source) that the homicide rate in the US dropped by 49% between '93 and '17.\n\nDuring the same time period, the federal Assault Weapons Ban expired and the largest rise in legal civilian gun ownership in US history happened, plus many states implemented Constitutional Carry laws.\n\nBut, y' know, take the guns first, due process second. \ud83d\ude44The saying I've heard is that there are over 400,000,000 legal firearms in the United States. If they were the problem, you'd know.The vast majority of all gun deaths are suicideI don't need to look it up. I know that's the case. However, somewhere between 32% and 45% of American households have a gun, while 95% of American households have a car.\n\nGun owners just tend to have a lot of guns. A thing is ubiquitous because it is found everywhere, not because there are a large number of them in a few specific places.[removed]The actual message of the study needs to be signal boosted. It's not a generalization about gun owners. It's about the impact of safety events. 40% of the people they gave locks to don't lock their guns. Thus their event does a pretty good job at reaching the intended audience. That's the point of the study.Yeah Teenagers have a longer list of enemies.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Will he take my mossberg and give me an AA-12?[removed]Ah, the bugs bunny approach.I prefer pianos for this duty.

    "Comments": "[deleted]In case anyone wondered, n = 12 (where n = number of participants). Still pretty awesome though. Pardon me if this is a dumb question but how do schizophrenic people know they are hallucinating?[removed]> they were asked to play a video game while in an MRI scanner, using their own mental strategies to move a computerised rocket\n\nCan anyone explain what the process here was? Did they have external/internal electrodes hooked up to their brains to communicate the controls by thought? Or did they verbalize the desired piloting, and thus it was just a matter of mental focus? Or did they have a physical hand-held controller?[removed]I'm actually impressed that they are able to play a video game in an MRI machine. Those things are cramped and really loud.What I wish people understood about schizophrenia is that while hallucination and delusion are symptoms that get a lot of attention due to their sensational nature, they are not the only symptoms and only tangentially related to the dysfunction that people w sx experience... \n\nIn my experience that dysfunction is due to the gross disorganization of thoughts. People who have less thought disorganization can deal with hallucination (as they can rationalize and minimize its effect on them.) People with more thought disorganization don't even have to have hallucinations to be dangerous to themselves or others.The anti-gaming sentiment surprises me. My son has a variety of mental problems and I noticed teraz ago that certain games work therapeutic on him (combined with parenting). His patience and determination increased when I showed him how to get through Zelda.\n\n I'd say Zelda is better than Ritalin for a six-year old. [removed][removed]How do I get into this field where I can create studies showing unique ways to help mental disorders? [removed][removed]Could something like this work for tinnitus?Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't an MRI really loud? How could you possibly hear the voices in your own head with a machine that loud?Does anyone know why it also turned down the volume of external voices?I mean.... neurofeedback has been around for decades. It sounds like they're sort of re-inventing the wheel, but in a more extreme, expensive way [removed]As someone who occasionally suffers from auditory hallucinations, just knowing these results (even with such a small sample size) makes me feel far more secure in my agency over my own mind. As someone with a S.O. that has Schizophrenia, this was horribly worded. They could have easily said \"People with Schizophrenia can train their own brains\" or \"this may work as cognitive treatment\" - not \"[They] can be trained\", like dogs. \n\nOn another note, this is really neat info! I'd love to see the study replicated with better parameters.What could be the possible application for people without schizophrenia? Is there one?OP neglected to mention whether it's positive or negative type schizophrenia. I assume positive type, since hearing voices was mentioned.\n\nSource: my mother is a negative type schizophrenic and I own a copy of the DSM IVI wonder if this would work with deaf people with schizophrenia. I know people which Charles bonnet syndrome see disembodied hands using sign language at themDoes this mean that certain therapeutic video games could be made available to the public (most likely in the future, not anytime soon) that would basically act as an effective treatment for schizophrenia? And could this be utilized to help treat other mental diseases?How about other types of hallucinations? I have multiple sclerosis and often get visual and aural hallucinations during relapses. Would playing video games possibly help with those hallucinations?Did they do a control with patients in an MRI machine doing nothing?Isn\u2019t there another video game therapy that helps to \u201crealign the clock in their brains\u201d that\u2019s helpful for symptom relief?There has been some work done using external electro magnetic stimulation to induce specific brain activity which can be mapped when the patient is in a Functional MRI machine. The popular book for lay people \"The Wisdom of Psychopaths\" explores this. I don't know much about schizophrenia, but are there any severe cases where *visual* hallucinations occur? Not like distortions of physical things, but actual images conjured up?How is this different from biofeedback for ADD?This seems to relay on the patient beeing aware of their sickness. I was on a similar program called nerodynamics. They used video games to help teach a individual how to concentrate on tasks using a neural feedback system measuring d waves or somthing.I think that spaceship might be a unity standard asset.When I first read that the auditory hallucinations are actually heard and not just in their head I was blown away Another new, different, and very effective method for treating auditory hallucinations called AVATAR therapy has recently been developed. \n\nIn short, the researchers created a digital avatar and matched its voice tone and quality to those of the hallucinations as closely as possible. The patient interacts with the avatar, which is controlled remotely by the therapist/psychiatrist, who speaks through the avatar with the patient. \n\nOver several weeks the therapist gradually alters the nature of the hallucinatory voice such that it becomes less persecutory or hostile. One of the main problems in patients who hear voices is that they feel helpless against it. This helplessness significantly decreases over time using the avatar and the content of the hallucinations becomes less unpleasant. The first random double blind study had n=75 in the experimental group. \n\nThe study can be found here\n\n http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(17)30427-3/fulltextDifferent cultures have different types of audio hallucinations too. I think in india they are mostly all playfull and happy It\u2019s also used to treat ptsdSo, I understand that schizophrenia can be difficult to diagnose at times. What if this method was used in diagnosing patients? If they can \u201ctrain\u201d a person and control the part of the brain linked to verbal hallucinations, can they then diagnose schizophrenia? Vs a person that they are not able to \u201ctrain\u201d, they can then rule out schizophrenia? Obviously it\u2019s not that simple... But what if? Could be a useful tool. Mental Health Nurse here, part of me rejoiced, part of me worried for my jobAs long as that video game isn't Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice I have a schizophrenic friend and I will definitely suggest this to him Does this reinforce the belief that free time is a big contributor to psychological problems (maybe not necessarily as severe as schizo) such as depression, or social anxiety?\n\nI've long wondered why labourers tend to have less chance of developing severe mental illnesses. They simply have less time to get lost in their thoughts.Is there such a thing as verbal hallucinations? Surely you mean auditory hallucinations? This also just makes sense, since while I'm playing video games I'm even able to shut out voices that *really are* there :P[removed]I see quite a few video-game related studies that tout the benefits of reasonable amounts of play. But, what does this replace that we are missing? I know that regular activity and exercise 'replaces' or helps compensate for the activity we have lost from agrarian work and pedestrian travel, but what do video games specifically aid us that other brain activities like reading does not?\n\nI hope my question makes sense...It\u2019s not schizophrenia but every once in a while I\u2019ll get really bad anxiety and play video games till it goes away. It helps me because what I\u2019m playing requires almost all my attention so my mind can\u2019t wander making it worse. [removed]This sounds similar to Neurofeedback. Does anyone know if the processes are similar at all?It's good but don't see it as a long term solution, unless there is a drug that modifies ones biological mechanism causing schizophrenia.  Sounds hopeful but also exhausting. I'm sorry for those who suffer this. Remember when we used to worry that video games would \u201crot our brains\u201d? Kind of ironic, right?I think the loud banging of the MRI drowned out those external voicesWere there a control group?So basically Neurofeedback Gaming? Pretty cool :)Could this have to do with how people with schizophrenia perceive actions and things to be out of their control/not of their doing, and retraining them to feel like they have control over something? Or is it simply distracting them?It reminds me the trick used in STNG against the Borg...So with a propperly designed game can you induce mental illness?So the opposite might be true too?Video games!!!  What can\u2019t they do?  PTSD?  Play Tetris.  Hand-eye co-ordination?  Action games.  What\u2019s next?  Cure Cancer?  Well, probably not.Reddit looking for more reasons to play video games, but yea, this is pretty neat even if the sample size is small.You had me at \u201cpeople with schizophrenia can be trained\u201dDoes this help prevent the brain tissue loss associated with schizophrenia?I'd be really interested in taking part in a study like this. I've always lived with my various hallucinations. Hell, I didn't know anything was wrong until I asked someone if they had any tricks to make the voices and shadows go away when they weren't able to sleep. Until that point, I thought they were something everyone had.They can tickle themselves and feel it tooWhile fMRI has many good qualities, its temporal resolution is not one of them. They say there was a delay of about 6s for the neurofeedback (although this seems ambitious), but even this strikes me as a long delay for a training mechanism. Perhaps EEG or MEG could be a better option? Albeit at a cost of spatial resolution and deep-brain structures.Aew yeah. A few more years and we may not even need to get up to get the remoteEveryone on the internet who reads this:\n\n\"Did you guys know that video games cure schizophrenia?? They really *are* good for you! My obsession is valid even though I don't have schizophrenia!\"So this is essentially neurofeedback training?Concentration drowns out internal voices just like it drowns out your single internal voiceRead the book Schizophrenia by psychiatrist Thomas Szasz. It's interesting how many neurotypes (rather than mental illnesses) all converge with auditory processing problems.\n\nAutism has at its core auditory processing issues. I'm autistic and my readings on the topic led me to conclude that -- it's why this schizo article stood out to me in the first place!\n\nAnxiety via hyperawareness could easily be perceived as an auditory processing issue.\n\nADHD is one giant auditory (among other stimuli) overload. \n\nMaybe there are a handful of switches here, and in typical people, none of them are pressed...but in neurodiverse people, different combinations of slight changes in auditory processing (say, at different steps along that process) leads to each of those neurodiverse outcomes.\n\nIncluding, it seems, schizophrenia.\n\nThere might be some benefit in looking at the neurodiverse community from this perspective. There might be some way to do something at the brain level (some kind of chemical software patch) that fixes the auditory processing and solves a whole bunch of different conditions.If they can be trained to control the part that has verbal hallucinations, you bet we can use it in some way to induce them as well.\nWould this work with tinnitus :oPeople who no longer have Tinnitus experience increased hearing.So this is true. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia but playing game keep my mind thinking and not distracted but focused. This is one of those studies that we already knew but science had to prove. That is, \u2018playing games distracts you from the shit in your life\u2019. \n\nI wonder if next they\u2019ll study the caveat, \u2018only so many hours per day\u2019 or the surely inevitable \u2018only if the game is made by Valve/Bethesda\u2019...It explains the popularity of KSP.Would it work for Tinnitus?My dad said all the hours of playing video games was a waste of time. Now we know it benefits mental health. \n\nCheck mate dad. No not you George, dad.\n\nWha.. quiet you! I was talking to dad. Hey... can I do this for my tinnitus? this is a stretch to say the least imo.\ndoes it work in reverse?I have a patient who requested some Thorazine for \u201cthe voices are telling me to cut myself\u201d.  They didn\u2019t work, his other PRN was zyprexa.  \u201cThat never works, but if it\u2019s all I got then I\u2019ll take it\u201d\nThis guys arms are all scarred up from cutting... the voices must be torturing him.  \n\nIn case anyone wondered, n = 12 (where n = number of participants). Still pretty awesome though.\n\nAuditory* hallucination?I can confirm that while playing metal gear solid, my hallucinations virtually vanished. pardon the pun.[removed][removed][removed]Can someone explain to me how this is more significant than say, reading a book? I would guess that any activity that takes your total concentration would see a turned down volume in these external voices as well. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love games and enjoy reading about research into their educational and healthy uses, just trying to think of the practical uses for something like this It may be a great solution but the real problem is getting schizophrenics to recognize that they have a problem that requires treatment in the first place. In their world they are sane, the voices are real and everyone else is crazy.Hi Guys,\n\nI never really understood Psychosis until I played Hellblade:  Senua's Sacrifice on PS4.  You hear voices constantly in your ears.  Your character sees and experiences things that aren't there.  It gave me a genuine appreciation for having a clue how hard it must be to have a mental disorder and survive in the world.  The game designers had worked with many people in the field.  Give it a try.This makes me wonder if the game could train the opposite to be true. Can a game increase symptoms as well? Fascinating to wonder how much control over the brain's function can be learned.There is a brilliant book by Julian Jaynes called \u2018The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind\u2019 that argues that these sort of hallucinations are a vestige of the past when we had some sort of ongoing and present connection with \u2018god\u2019 and those words were an efficient way of moving data around the brain.  Highly recommended read![removed][removed]So kind of machine learning for humans? [deleted]Seems to me that it might be easier to put them in a jungle setting and learn meditation and yoga. At least for the less intense onesExtended water only fasting cures most schizophrenia. trials in Japan have had remarkable success  I basically got kidnapped by a guy with schizophrenia once.\n\n wish he would have played more video gameslet's give these people, I dunno, dark souls. It'll replace their current mental condition with something better, like intense rage and bouts of murderous intent! So focusing on something really hard makes you stop hearing people who want to talk to you even if they don't exist?\n\nIn latest news, people who once were thought to suffer severe mental hallucinations are found out to be telekinetics and psychics. Science has discovered a simple key for unlocking their power, but first does this dress make Brittany look fat?What if the video game is Outlast or something like that? Does that change the outcome? Does this mean the opposite can be true?  Yikes![removed]So the title meant \"Aural\" hallucinations. I was thrown by the language.Whatever the case is, I don't see putting patients inside an MRI to play \"mind games\" as a realistic treatment plan anytime soon with todays technology. MRI's are big and require big teams to operate and prep work to be in. They're also REALLY expensive. \n\nIt's good research for the future when we may have better wearable technology to scan brain signals in the same or similar way.So the real question is if it is because of significant distraction reducing the verbal hallucinations, or does specific motor skills being activated while playing the game cause them to be reduced. Either way, these types of disorders can use any help that they can. \nThank you for sharing.Hey, I'm at the gym and don't have enough time to look at this in-depth just yet, but I have a question. Is the obvious conclusion that the video game required focused attention, which drowned out auditory hallucinations? And if so, could this explain higher rates of schizophrenia in musicians?\n\nSource: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2899997/Maybe it can be adapted for tinnitus relief!! It\u2019s all in the brain supposedly. For background:  I am not a clinician; however, I have worked in the administrative world of a residential psychiatric treatment facility where people with severe positive symptoms have chosen treatment and residence.  (It is unique and was born over 30 years ago due to the warehousing of those in an extended care ward of a state run hospital.) \n\nOne of the most successful approaches that our clinicians have seen is that social connection and engagement, along with good oversight of psychiatric symptoms/medication and cognitive behavior therapy, have seen the most improvement and stability for the patients we serve.  Mind you most have some very serious issues with insight, judgment, medication self management, and difficulty with cognition.  However, they have developed close friendships with peers and staff; experience a safe place to live; have support for mental as well as medical treatment and symptom management when unable to provide for themselves, and are provided good nutrition.  They are voluntary residents and can choose to leave but almost none do choose to leave.  This is interesting and must mean they feel it is \"home\".  Complaints have always been addressed immediately and mistreatment/abuse is not allowed as we have seen in so many mental health settings.  \n\nAs to your research, ANY research into methods to help people with a mental health diagnosis that creates roadblocks to wellbeing is beyond needed.  I am encouraged by those doing such research; however, I think it is very important to look at the holistic needs of every individual.  Depending upon the individual's ability to function and manage themself should be a larger focus.  Tools to assist any individual are needed; and any engagement appears to reduce positive symptoms.  I would encourage a study that encompassed engagement as  a whole in the environment to determine symptom relief.  \n\nI mean no disrespect nor mean to detract from the research.  Good luck going forward.\n\nEdit to add:  In addition, a major portion of the program for the resident/patient is facilitating the individual awareness of personal responsibility and control to the level that they are capable.From all the Hated Gamers for years and more to come: \"you're welcome\"[deleted]If it's consistent across the board that's a great number. Unless we got the 12 out of 50 million that reacts positively to it though.\n\nJokes aside, even if it is working on just 10%, it is risk free and can improve millions of people's lives. So no need for the good ole reddit pseudo debunking Which is a normal sample size for experiments like this.[removed]For an MRI study on patients that's actually a really decent number. Effect sizes in these experiments tend to be high enough to show consistent effects with ~15 people.Someone took stat101. But seriously your comment is very misleading. This isn't a survey.Sample sizes are tough with small populations like schizophrenia. A pilot study like this, even with a sample size under 20, can still be valuable for justifying further research.[deleted]What kind of p value does n=12 give?[deleted]what does r mean?[removed]Typically, I believe it's by consciously trying to consider the sources of the visual or auditory stimuli: if you're hearing voices but there's no one in the room, it might be possible to establish that they're hallucinations. Which is part of why getting help is so important: diagnosis allows for establishing a clear explanatory pattern for hallucinations-- \"I have schizoaffective disorder and these are hallucinations, they are not coming from real people.\"[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Sounds like they wired them up to monitor their brainwaves, and knew that a certain way of thinking reduced the symptoms so they designed a game where thinking in a specific way controls the rocket and that gives them feedback that they are thinking in the correct way, training them to control the rocket (but it's actually training them to reduce symptoms by thinking)Ive been hooked up to this game for a different reason. In my case it was a bunch of electrodes to measure emotional stress and tension in muscles. As far as i can understand it, any way of measuring a good or bad response can be translated into the game. They were in an fMRI ('f' = functional) which allows for real-time monitoring of brain activity.  \nThe game itself was probably a small screen inside the MRI right above their head, which is held still with a brace\n\nRegarding response time(-loop), I'm clueless\n\nNo wires required :)It sounds like they're reinventing neurofeedback[removed][removed][removed][removed]Maybe give CBD a try, works wonders for me. After minutes of trying it my mind went quiet. Caught me off guard at first, I almost cried.For tests and such when I have been in them they supply a kind of headphone so you can hear the tests and such. Still impresses me they have a monitor that works in there.My first and only time in an MRI made me almost have a panic attack. Just the combination of cramped quarters, loud sounds, and being unable to move really freaked me out.[deleted][removed][removed][removed][removed]Typically you would need to train as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. To be a psychiatrist, you need to complete medical school, i.e. complete an MD; to be a psychologist, you need to complete a PhD. Both types of programs are difficult to get into, so you usually need a stellar undergraduate record which includes research experience.[removed]There is something kinda similar, where you can find the frequency of the tinnitus and run it on a loop with headphones to try and make the brain tune it out when the headphones are off. Certain blood pressure meds can help with tinnitus. You know the palms trick right? Actually, there are studies about neurofeedback (what they actually did in the article) to treat the phantom sound percept. Due to the fact, that tinnitus, its origin and the connectivity within the network are not fully understood, the treatment is not standard (yet)\nNo? That's a physical problem, not a mental one. MRI machines are very loud. I've never experienced hearing voices (other than one time, like 20 years ago, I was sitting in my room and heard a woman say just my name). \n\n\nMy guess however, since \"hearing voices\" doesn't involve any actual audio input, a loud MRI machine probably won't interfere with that. Hearing voices is more like having intrusive thoughts that don't feel like your own thoughts (from my understanding. I'm a doctor of nothing, unless you count burgers). While outside audio for myself can distract from some of the voices/thoughts that I hear other times they are overwhelming. That said the few times when I have been in a MRI they give me a kind of headphone.They probably meant that the hallucinations are \"external voices\". Later in the article the author mentions that the therapy helps some internalize the external voices which makes them less stressful.I thought of it more like martial arts training. You have to be trained in a skill before you can use it on your own, and that sort of visualization is difficult to do.I had the same thought. It was worded in a way that caused me to immediately bristle.[deleted]From the article:\n\n> Dr Orlov added: \"Although the study sample size is small and we lacked a control group, these results are promising.\n\n> \"We are now planning to conduct a randomised controlled study to test this technique in a larger sample.\"For myself they happen more rarely. Usually they are alterations of existing things as you say but I do believe some things that I have seen can not have been real.Yes. While auditory hallucinations are much more common, visual hallucinations do occur for some people. During my psychosis, I had visual hallucinations, delusions, never voices but it felt like there was a message, through the radio, people talking around me, etc. In the hospital waiting to be admitted my family\u2019s eyes looked different. I remember seeing a spaceship out the window, metal bending , the door opening by itself, the list goes on As your comment seems to imply, this awareness is rare and often fleeting.\n\nAnosognosia is far more common.I had never really looked into this and may need to. My knee jerk reaction is that likely they have the same ratio but it goes unreported or undiagnosed. Thanks though as I have something new to look up.I think they mean auditory hallucinations that manifest as voices.\n\nAlthough I don't know whether it might work on hallucinations of other noises, knocking, banging, car horns and that kind of thing. Perhaps the brain network they were working with is specific to speech? This isn't about a regular kind of video game, it's one that is controlled by part of your brain being read by an MRI Machine.\n\nThey used their brain to land the plane, the part of their brain that can silence audible hallucinationsI would say that it's probably not reasonable to assume all people are fully healthy by default without the activity we lost etc. We are going to experience bugs just because of genetics and living life. Some people have in built problems like schizophrenia.[removed][removed]I mean the study just demonstrated a linkDoes it have any impact on the cognition deficits in SCZ patients? A friend of mine has done research in this area for years and she said that while hallucinations are the most outwardly perceived symptoms, the inability to learn and acquire new skills is why so many SCZ sufferers end up homeless. So true. However,at least in the states,how will they be able to even *afford* such therapy? That's my burning question. [removed]In the UK we have the NHS. Also, it's more about developing the theory of it first, then refining it to more practical treatments methods.I'm pretty sure the MRI machine isn't part of the treatment. I think it's just there so the researchers can view the results. The actual treatment is probably all in the game.\n\nEdit: yeah I think I was wrong. I think they are using MRI in this study to monitor the effects of the video game, but ultimately the benefits are not caused by the MRI. So hopefully they can just use the video game for treatment without the expense of an MRIThey can use it as a stronger proof of concept then develop a system that works with single channel EEG or something - that's a much cheaper solution if they can get the computation side to work right.Biofeedback can also be monitored through MEG, which is still absurdly expensive to build, operate, and maintain, but much more comfortable for the patient, and could be considered \"wearable\" tech.\n\nEDIT: also, I don't really think that treatment without the presence of a medical professional is the goal in these types of patient populations.People forget that you get thousands of data points from fmri, so you can get highly statistically significant results with a small number of participants. No control group is a bigger issue, and skepticism is always warranted with novel findings, but it's important to clarify that n=12 doesn't mean \"pack your bags everybody, junk science and statistical ignorance are the only reason this study exists.\"[deleted]I'm actually still quite grateful for the reddit pseudo debunking. It spawned a whole discussion that probably taught some people about what actually constitutes bad experimentation, and it reinforced the good aspects of this study. That's what makes skepticism so beautiful. Imo it didn't bog down this thread at all and it makes me feel more confident that actual (close-to) worthless science will be identified in a timely manner. edit: well I guess one problem I do see with it is the way reddit sort of locks-in opinions over time because of the rating system.[removed][removed]> Unless we got the 12 out of 50 million that reacts positively to it though.\n\nStatistics don\u2019t work that way. Think of it like this. In theory you could flip a coin infinite times, meaning whatever sample you take of flips of a particular coin is from a \u201cpopulation\u201d that is infinitely large. But if you flipped a coin twenty times and got twenty heads, you would be sensible to consider that it is likely to be a biased coin.Actually, are we 100% sure that MRI scans are safe yet? I thought you were supposed to avoid them as much as possible (not taking them if not necesarry) because even though we suspect they are harmless maybe we haven't done enough (long term) research. Or am I wrong?Eh, not saying it did, but if something like this were to cost my personal tax dollars, as someone without schizophrenia or schizophrenic family members to benefit positively, I\u2019d be pretty unhappy with a 10% success rate after a certain cost. For me, if even a dollar of my money went to something with a 10% success rate, when it could have gone to something with a 90% success rate that screams ineptitude of decision makers. People want to make the easy decisions and give everything to everyone, which is why we are gonna need earth #2 in about a decade. Sometimes it\u2019s ok to look at things skeptically and question society\u2019s ROI. \n\nI think critically looking a this stuff adds many voices of reason that we need to get the full picture. What leads you to believe it is risk free?\n[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]What kind of control? I assume you mean a different kind of attention-based task to compare with? p-value is actually pretty complex to calculate, and requires an in-depth understanding of the experiment (which I don't have right now) to account for certain variables.\n\nHowever, a good rule of thumb for a binomial experiment (only two results exist) is you need at least 10 successes (n\\*p >= 10) or 10 failures (n\\*q >= 10) to determine if the results are statistically significant.Depends on the effect size, number of trials, length of time in the MRI scanner, MRI parameters and a host of other factors.  I will say that 12 people in an fMRI study is well within the normal range.  fMRI is extremely expensive to do.Yes. If you ever see n= in a study it's the sample size IndeedYour days sounds like mine exactly. Too afraid to leave my room, too afraid to shower when anyone else is home, too paranoid to make food when people are home. That all-encompassing, engulfing feeling of something terrible, but you're never quite able to shake it, and it eats away at your sense of self, til there's nothing but your worst parts, and everyone else telling you you've still got the good parts underneath, but you can't ever quite believe them. \n\nI don't know how much longer I can take of this. Spot onI've met people with psychosis from mania and they could mostly tell fact from fiction. They would think things that they knew were irrational. That didn't necessarily stop them from acting on it, but they would acknowledge what they thought was paranoid or incorrect.\n\nI'm not sure how it goes with schizophrenia. there might be no one in the room, but in some cases they say it's government that implanted tiny microphones or aliens, or something else that is almost invisible and only \"they\" can remove it.[removed]I hear people calling my name and asking me questions.  Usually when in public settings but it's happened when I was completely by myself a few times.  \n\nI also get lucid dreams and astral projection dreams almost nightly.  I always assumed I had an active mind but it's been getting pretty ludicrous recently.\n\nI honestly believe I have mild schizophrenia but it's so mild no one can tell.  [removed][removed][removed]Ah thanks, that makes a lot more sense.  I was so focused on the control aspect that I hadn't even progressed to the application of diagnosis & treatment.So I\u2019m still a little confused- do we know what about this game specifically made more of a difference? \nPut simply, you win the game by having good style thoughts...? I've been offered an incredibly similar process for my ADHD. Was the first thing I thought of when I read this headline.> monitor their brainwaves\n\nNope, it's MRI, so not about the synchronous activity like EEG.  You're actually observing blood flow to active areas of the brain, not how in sync the neurons are (which is what \"brainwaves\" reflect).  So essentially you're looking at how \"hard\" an area is working relative to the others.So is this just the same as any kind of biofeedback monitor, such as the Muse headband for meditation?I've also been hooked up to a game similar to this, but for ADD/ADHD treatment. There were a few variants that seemed out of this world when I was younger. I'm impressed to see that the technology is maturing, it helped me focus when I was a child. I'm sure it can be so much more.This was my thought too, having done lots of neurofeedback. Would it be similar though?[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]Illegal in my country. I microdose with just normal pot. Turns many voices into one. I try not to bring it up much, there ain't much research on it so it comes across as anecdotal. Oh man, you said it so well. It's a hard row to hoe, I feel for you.\n\nMy ex would be like this while driving... Truly unsafe on the road, had a hard time following the rules of the road but never had outward symptoms that would merit a 5150, not even when he was ticketed for reckless driving:  \n93mph, passing on the right, at 1130pm in driving rain, and I told the officer why this happened.[removed]You could also get an education in neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, psychoneuroendocrinology (might be a stretch for some areas of neuro, but does come into play in a big way for memory and some mental illnesses), neuropsychology, neurology (which is actually a medical specialty but also strongly associated with research), etc.\n\nMost psychologists and psychiatrists have a practice.  If you want to go into research, you can have a practice on the side, but generally you stick to academia.Wouldn\u2019t that make it worse? Like songs getting stuck in your head?[removed]What is the palms trick Also potassium blockers that block the KCNQ potassium channel might help, although there would probably be side effects.There are different causes.  Tinnitus is either neurological or physiological depending on the cause.  They used to think it was damaged inner ear follicles that send a recursive feedback loop, but the newest research suggests that it is often from a feedback loop in the brain.Actually some meds can cause tinnitus like antidepressants or antibiotics. All physical problems are in some way mental ones. The brain can learn to ignore the abberant signals.I also rationalized it as coaching - after the fact. I'm sure they didn't really mean it that way.  However, as a Scientific Research Technician, I've read a fair amount of papers and it really stuck out like a sore thumb to me.  As professionals, we should be vigilant about the way we present things, and mental health already carries so much stigma and marginalization as it is.Openwater CEO Mary Lou Jepsen says they will have an MRI-resolution scanner using near infrared light in a few years in a ski hat type wearable at a smartphone pricepoint. So that may be a possibility. \n\nBut, there are case reports of the utility of neurofeedback in schizophrenia without using fMRI. Thanks!As a schizophrenia victim myself I think it is because mental stress causes mental illness whereas physical stress causes physical illness.[removed]You might know this already, but we generally categorize schizophrenia effects into \u2018positive\u2019 symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking) and \u2018negative\u2019 symptoms (apathy, lethargy, social withdrawal). I can\u2019t speak to the degree to which each causes disability, but as far as treatment goes, we\u2019re way, WAY better at treating the positive symptoms than the negative ones.\n\nIn schizophrenia, there\u2019s a hypothesis that dopamine is too high in one part of the brain (causing positive symptoms), and too low in another part (causing negative ones). We treat the positive symptoms with antipsychotics, which block dopamine receptors... but they affect them everywhere. That means we fix the positive symptoms, but the drugs can actually make the negative symptoms worse.The answer is \u201cmaybe\u201c. It depends upon where the person is in terms of their symptoms severity and whether they are experiencing cognitive deficit to the point they can\u2019t really function (and thus participate in training) ...amongst many other factors. I can say for certain though that some cognitive training and meditation practises do help if done gently, regularly and over a long period of time. \n\nSource:Family members and friends with schizophrenia who have benefitted from these practices. Again though, it takes years of training to make a noticeable change and only as an adjunct to medication and various support systems and practices.Generally **Yes**. But this answer is neither absolute nor generaliseable. Its not as black and white, rather nuanced really. Firstly we should put aside (but stay mindful of) thought disorder and hence disorganized speech. Though I suspect there is definitely an interaction here, and most certainly with a lot of SZ's negative symptoms that result in cognitive \"deficits\" (I find this a generally, crude way of describing the manifestation, which is more like cognitive \"disorganization\" and hence people perform worse in typical cognitive domains).\n\nOne must consider, essentially, all the emergent reactions of a \"normal\" human mind to SZ's particular symptoms. Now this depends on said pathologies and place on the spectrum. Hallucinations, delusions, disordered thought as well as issues with *self-ipseity* (resulting in dissociative affects) are all related pathologies in schizophrenia, yet with potential for intense interplay and ensuing confirmation bias. What ia very important is their active interaction through cognitive engagement. Finally, a common pathology with SZ, which is independant and merely due to being a human being; is **anxiety**. Anxiety and fear are incredibly important elements in the disorder that is SZ. Partly (and importantly) due to stigma, common societal ignorances (passive stigma) as well as the simply confusing and disturbing nature of hallucinations which results in demonization and threat-association. Even when, literally speaking, said hallucinations are (mostly) harmless perceptual distortions, which represent random activity breaching perceptual thresholds, or metaphorically represent the general state of mind (potentially analogous to a phenomena similar to synesthesia; eg; emotions manifesting as linguistic streams), they are either way typically instantly labelled as threatening, \"abnormal\" and terrible by affected individuals. This is where a lot of cognitive issues can arise from, and are not necessarily inherent in; SZ. The process kicks in vigilance, hightened anxiety and causes an individual to quasi-innately engage strongly with the stimulus (in an effort to avoid, nullify and/or rationalise away the hallucination). As you would with any other salient threat, yet in this case it isnt only quasi-automatic for this to happen (due to social and personal reasons), its also paradoxically extremely detrimental, as the percepts cannot be actively resolved/resisted/avoided/elminated by the individual, and so a vicious cycle of reinforced fear and hightened general anxiety (and hence as well general, basal neurological activity) leads to increased frequency and negative intensity of hallucinations. This can obviously lead to profound delusions, ego dissolutions (due to intense perceptual incoherence) and finally intense engagement in anxious, chaotic and ruminative cognitions. And the driving force is literally mostly anxiety. This results in an individuals cognitive capacities; such as attention and working memory, literally being constantly consumed (and not truly reduced) in this vicious cycle (because of a perceived threat, that never gets resolved in this way). In my opinion this element is drastically under appreciated in society, as well as some clinicians and *especially GPs* (that really shouldnt be allowed to prescribe squat for psychiatric issues) whom just try and attend to the positive innate symptoms. The individuals reaction is IMO just as if not more important, just like if you were to acutely become psychotic, (because these people on average really arent *that* abnormal, what is normal anyway? A pragmatic societal notion?). Essentially anxiety can result in hugely introcepted, chaotic, ruminative, dissociative, cognitively consuming states of being. Particularly if you are quite literally fearing a part of your own (more [relative to the norm] subjective) reality.\n\nAnd I can tell you from personal experience, having OCD/Generalized anxiety with dissociative symptoms that this can be *hugely* intense (while in my case it was merely the irrational *fear of* psychosis/hallucinations, in my acutely dissociative episode). It consumes all of your attention and functional capacity, me telling my crisis worker with a straight face that my sister was 7 (she is 16) and my dad consequently staring at me in confusion, or randomly pulling my pants down when getting to the couch to *attempt* to watch some TV, constant and seemingly uncontrollable inner monologue, I felt like a hyper stimulated, near-insane spastic, and hence started thinking I had some kind of brain damage or prionic infection (after being reassured I wasnt going insane!). Really it was just anxiety and terrible introspective psychology (coming from a 3rd year neuro major, which says a lot about the average persons mental relationships), which all resolved when my anxiety; ignorances/irrationalities/distortions in psychology (which are *very* common, disorder aside) were resolved. I not only finished uni but wrote the best paper of my degree the following semester, which a few months before felt impossible.\n\nPeople with Schizophrenia (and shizoid/typal) disorders typically initially present with distortions in their perceptive realities, variations due to error or hyperactive pattern-finding, really just a reality that is \"over 2 standard deviations\" from the mean. Yet we stigmatize, misunderstand and demonize these variations, so guess what, people with SZ will do this to themselves, to their own reality. **A reality that is truly no less beautiful than anyone else's**. It is possible to have Schizophrenia without having a disorder.God I really hate how important this question is.There are a growing number of congregate sites that work with people experiencing Schizophrenia. Having this kind of video game in the house would be a great help with treatment (if the study holds up). Though it is true that many with schizophrenia would not have the resources to use a game like this.[deleted][removed][removed]Yeab, but NHS, or the Norwegian alternative doesn't make MRI machines and MRI Techs more available and numerous. and while it's a terrible conditions, I'm pretty sure cancer and blood clots and such come first.\n\nI mean, as I said the research is awesome and will be useful, but it needs more portable and user friendly technology than MRI. No, the feedback part requires active monitoring for the game to work.I guess that makes sense. But the it seemed like they used the mri/mind to control the gameYep. People get caught up on sample size, but it's highly contingent on the type of study being done. Cross-sectional epidemiology study? n=12 is a joke. fMRI neurofeedback case-series? n=12 is pretty greatThanks for giving us credit, but we didn't forget shit. We plain had no clue. could you elaborate on this, how can you get thousands of data points from fmri with only 12 patients?I wonder if there is any connection between hallucinations and anxiety attacks ?  \n\nIn other words are schizophrenics having some kind of anxiety that manifests itself in different ways ?   \n\nOr another possibility is that hallucinations can't really be classed as anxiety attacks, BUT...if you were compare the brain activity to schizophrenics suffering from hallucinations VS.  the brain activity of people suffering from \"classic\" anxiety attacks... then you might find some interesting/useful overlaps/similarities  in the data...\n\nI used to suffer from pretty severe anxiety attacks and in the past few years have experienced some mild tinnitus... my subjective experience is that there seems to be some similarities between the two phenomena... \n\nIn my experience, the more I mentally focus on the sound of tinnitus, the worse it seems to get and when I used to get anxiety attacks, the more I focus on my racing heart beat, the worse the panic got... the two ailments seem extremely similar in that way. \n\nAlso, distracting myself from concentrating on the physical sensations of an anxiety attack seemed to be an almost surefire remedy ( when I was successful at distraction )... Basic distraction worked so well for me, that I've only experienced a handful of anxiety attacks in the last 10 years, and the ones I did experience were very mild.  \n\nLikewise with tinnitus,  any sort of constant noise that washes out the sound seems to work very well in making the tinnitus completely disappear after about 30 mins to 1 hour of having distracting noise present... It usually disappears to the point that I will no longer experience the tinnitus for the rest of the day/night even in total silence. \"Debunking\" is a bad word to use, because it implies that a low n=false finding. Low n just means \"we need more information to be confident that we're correct.\" [removed][removed]You can read the FDA's article [here](https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MRI/ucm482765.htm). [deleted]There are so many vastly more horrible things your tax dollars are funding, stuff like this shouldn't even be on your radar at this point. [removed][removed][removed][removed]I guess the control would be...the patients when they don't participate in the activity?\n\nI don't know.  It is a good question.\n\n>\"While this is preliminary data, it's particularly promising that patients were able to control their brain activity even without the MRI scanning - suggesting that this may be a strategy that people, who have followed the MRI neuro-feedback training protocol, can benefit from at home.\"\n\nI'm interested in there being more thorough research into this even based on this glimpse, as do they.  And fleshing out a control group does pose interesting questions.Well we need lots of things to be controlled to properly quantify any findings. \n\nControlled populations, tasks, frequency and duration of exposure to tasks, as well as to stimuli... \n\nThese guys took 12 schizophrenics and had them play a video game and liked what the saw...Wouldn't 5 successes be significant at the 5% level?I hear you, hang in there. The moments of clarity do make it all worth it even if you cannot see it at the time.If I have a moment of insight during my psychosis, a new delusion comes as like a \"fence\" to keep me delusional. Often things that involve me getting hurt/killed for \"resisting\", or that they can read my mind so stop thinking, basically things that discourage me from doubting my delusions. Like my brain's self-defense mechanisms to hide its defects\n\nIt's like even when I know something sounds ridiculous, when the stakes are so high for messing up and making the wrong decision it makes me hesitate. And if I'm manic my decision-making is even more impaired and the danger seems even more immediate, it's just an awful synergy.Yep, exactly.[removed][removed][removed][removed]You should get help now, in case the symptoms get worse.I think you do too. Source: functioning schizophrenic. [removed][removed]I don't know how the game works exactly, but the thought patterns are what make the difference. The game is a tool to train their brains to suppress the voices they hear, improving their control of a specific part of their brain to lessen the impact of the voices they hear. As for the 'style' of thought i don't know what they think of but it seems as if it's  done by thinking in a specific way, following a pattern or focusing on a thought.Hi I am working in a similar neurofeedback field right  now, and without reading the paper (too lazy, just here for the comments) I will assume they found a cognitive state that reduces schizophrenia, (e.g. producing lots of a certain type of brainwave) and then rewarded the player for putting their brain into that healthy state by moving the spaceship. \n\nI probably could have just read the whole thing in the time it took to type this on my awkward-ass phone.Do it . I have been doing nuero for add ,insomnia and anxiety and it works wonders . I found that it helps alot . For insomniacs like myself its amazing as while its setup for sleep training and your playing the game , you nearly just fall asleep constantly , though obviously you have to stay awake to continue training . After awhile you recognise and can direct your brain to that setting and get more healthy sleep . Its worth every cent .Mine was ADHD and sleep therapy. You play the golf game too?[removed][removed][deleted]For those wondering how thought disorganization contributed to the example situation: he was overwhelmed with the task of driving in the rain, at night, while navigating holiday traffic and his reaction was to flee.\n\nOther examples of disorganized behavior:  \nHe couldn't do any paperwork including one page job apps or his own Medicare application and health plan selection when he was approved for SSDI and automatically kicked off Medicaid. (That one caused him to go back into the hospital because his insurance and hence, medication lapsed.)\n\nKitchen tools had to be duplicated because he could not find them or put them back in the right place. He had a hard time matching alike things so our recycling was always messed up, he only wore one kind one brand sock; matched sets of anything were an impossibility. \n\nNo, our brains tune out many strongly consistent signals. It's like when a fan shuts off, you realize you didn't hear that it was ever on (you filtered it out), but you recognize the change and that it became silent.Yeah. It's not a cure just a temp relief for some. Put your palms over your ears facing backwards and tap your skull with your middle finger. It reduces symptoms for a little while.I have tinnitus for 10 years. And while i finally managed to 'reduce\"  it somehow during last couole of years and had the best month of my life in december finally pushing myself and my career from the dead end.... But... during the january something snapped and it is louder than ever, im literarly spending half of my awake time trying to calm myself and stay sane... Mine started after acustic trauma... Moving my jaws or head can increase the severity sometimes.. God im cursed. My biggest issue is that it is on maximum volume when I wake up, while when I was in better conditon it was tuned down when waking up and I could keep it quiet and not notice it by quickly turning some music on and keeping my brain busy... Now its maxed and intrusive from the moment i open my eyes.. Sry for the rant.. Felt like a place where i could share..I know you can stop it for a while by snapping your fingers against the base of your skull, wouldn't that imply that it's purely physical? Those would still be physical effects...?[removed][deleted]As do I...But when I see stuff like this posted in Health,or Science subs,I can't help but think that very thought, and I think it a *lot*.\n\n  Yeah, this is remarkable they can do this now,but since most people with serious shit like schizophrenia are poor as church mice...Welllll..... I did not know about this. Thanks for the information. Maybe if funding could be provided in libraries,etc. for these,they might help some folks.\nAnyway,thanks for the thoughtful response.There are other ways to identify cancers and blood clots. In practice wouldn't PET be more useful for blood clot patients?\n\nAnyway, I don't pretend to even mostly understand how the treatment works, but if it yields benefits for a while after treatment, then that'd definitely make it quite worthwhile (obviously if it's only effective while the person is in the MRI scanner then that is less useful).\n\nAs I said though, it's the theory of it first, now we know that such methods can be used to help them, refinements and different implementations can be tried. Artificial lungs have (or are being) developed for breathing normal air, whereas in the past only purified oxygen was suitable. Theory then refinement.Reddit credo; we love getting credit, but we also know we don't deserve it. We didn't know we were ignorant but we learned something new when you explained it to us!\n\nNow to go repeat the one factoid to others with unfounded confidence.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]I'd go with getting schizophrenics to play a video game, any video game and giving them the same amount of information that the experimental group had to rule out any placebo effect for instance. If you told a group of schizophrenic individuals that they were playing a special version of Skyrim that could potentially help their condition how many would see an improvement in ability to deal with the voices?You don't want the same people in control and treatment because  whichever they receive first may impact how effective the second is.I got diagnosed with bipolar 2, I've had mania but no psychosis (hypomania I guess it is). My judgement and temperament get worse the more nights I don't sleep or sleep very little. It's like Jekyll and Hyde except it's only me and I'm sometimes an asshole.  \n\nBest of luck in your mental health. [removed][removed][removed][removed]In my opinion, wouldn\u2019t that be the most helpful information to disclose? What about this method that helped the schizophrenic individuals, rather then just titling it something along the lines of \u201cvideo game helps silence schizophrenic voices\u201d? \nI\u2019ve been curious about how much and how video games help schizophrenic individuals in general. I\u2019m familiar with someone who went undiagnosed with schizophrenia for years, and coped by obsessively gaming. He claims it was the only thing that silenced his mind when he was stressed. My issue is that I moved for college, I trust my psychologist a ton, and from what I understand is more permanent than medications ever could be. I would just have to wait for a free summer when I'm back at my parents.Not a golf one that I remember! I did play the rocket ship one, some sort of PACMAN-esque game, and then there was one that hooked up to a little train set on the ground, and it would move on the tracks with the right stimulation.Being his passenger often felt like having a gun to my head.\n\nEdit: I know that it harsh so I wanted to give Kudos to you for recongizing the stressful effect this can have on others. Unfortunately, I think my ex has some Cluster B disorder mixed in (jury's out on which) which means that he often just doesn't give a damn about others' reality (why he's ex- now).Just making the distinction it's not always from noise or direct trauma. It\u2019s what I was taught during my psych clerkship in med school, so don\u2019t have a reference on hand... but the Wikipedia page for the [dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_hypothesis_of_schizophrenia) seems to be pretty good, albeit probably a little too technical.Schizophrenia.com/diag\n\nI'm a psych major currently, positive/negative symptoms are a key characteristic of Schizophrenia. Positive symptoms can be thought of as adding issues that shouldn't be there(i.e. Hearing voices or having delusions). These are additional behaviors you would not see in normal people, so they are \"positive\" because you are adding them.\n\nNegative symptoms are the opposite. Negative symptoms are when normal behaviors and feelings are negatively affected or absent. Flat affect(no tonality in the voice), lethargy(low energy), apathy(why should i care about:), anhedonia(lack of pleasure, even in activities once found pleasurable).\n\nI can find more resources for you depending on what you want to know and i'm happy to try to answer any questions you may have[removed][removed]Going further you could make it a double blind experiment where neither the people recording data nor the participants know who got the therapy video game and who got a normal video game. If you still see a improvement when the data are combined then you potentially have a winner. I hear u on the Jekyll and Hyde. I can't believe some of the shit I have done. Especially during long episodes it really does feel like I become another person. During my first episode I was manic for 9 whole months, and I'm still traumatized by it two years later.\n\nI'll bet ur not an asshole, everyone's mania/hypomania can present differently. Mania's not always the giddy euphoria everyone thinks it is. It's like being drunk, there's different \"forms\". But none of them are the real you.\n\nHope everything goes well for you too, good luck\n\n\n[removed]It does say that it's not the actual game that helps, its the way they control the game. it's like learning to use a muscle. The game is just a tool to help visualise you moving an intangible muscle. With enough training they can do it without the need for a feedback method to see if they are doing it right. Generic games do not help (in the category of curing or reducing effects) it's the patients ability to fine-tune their thoughts and direct them to a specific outcome that is treated as the input to the game so they can see that they are thinking 'correctly'. It's this thought pattern that combats the effects of schizophrenia as it \"helps to internalise voices heard and decrease their volume\".So am I schizophrenic or just depressed? I have all the negative symptoms but don't think I have any of the positive. I disassociate a lot and try to not focus on reality whenever I can[removed][removed]Best bet is to see a licensed counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist. They'll ask a bunch of questions and probably see you regularly a little while. They may not have an answer right away, but that's ok. They need time to get communication right etc. Not a medical professional, but have read a fair bit on the subject. Apparently it can be tested for using a combination of a blood test and a CT Scan (MRIs wprk too, but much more expensive).\n\nNot sure if negative symptom only schizophrenia is a thing, but if it is, it would likely have very high misdiagnosis rates.\n\nEdit: Was curious so did a bit of reading, for anyone interested google \"Schizophrenia Deficit Syndrome\"[removed]",

Facebook is such a cesspool of nonsense and information bubbles that it rots your brain[removed]Now show me a study of people who use Reddit as an additional source of newsWhat does it mean to \"get your news from Facebook\"? All the news I read on fb are shared articles (often the same ones I see on Reddit). Are they referring to opinionated rants on personal statuses, like there are people who would somehow consider that news? Or is it just easier to say that anyone who shares on fb is likely sharing misinformation..?[removed]Ah yes, facebook is the problem. \n\nGood thing I get my news from the reliable reddit.  No way this website would be suffering from the exact same plague of misinformation, right?[removed]Same for Reddit or any social media I\u2019d bet.[removed]*\u201cDo your own research!\u201d*\n\n- people who use facebook as a news sourceThe expected answers to the questions are in some cases controversial, though.  At the risk of being struck by lightning here, I'll point to the masks question:\n\n\"\\*Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe survey expected the answer \"False\" to this.\n\nAt the time of the survey, there was a much larger (or at least louder) chorus of experts suggesting against mask use in healthy persons.\n\nIf this survey were given today, presumably the 'correct' answer would be True, despite reasonable experts continuing to opine on both sides.  On the other hand, we're also seeing very little effect in population-level outcomes from mask use, so it's possible that things are swinging back in the direction of False.  If someone answers one way or another, how do we know whether they're ahead of the curve or behind it?\n\nSo the frustration of the data here isn't only in the news sources, but in the epistemology of how to code some of the responses.According to this research, \u201cFacebook, Twitter, and online newspapers have been identified as the best platforms for monitoring misinformation and dispelling rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories among the general people\u201d. They found that most of the COVID-19 \"rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories were identified from India, the United States, China, Spain, Indonesia, and Brazil\"\u00a0(The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene: [https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/103/4/article-p1621.xml](https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/103/4/article-p1621.xml))Absurd propaganda garbage, like everything posted by this user[removed][deleted][removed][removed]Since settled science is by consensus it\u2019s very important we all agree with the settled science, so that it can remain settled and not disturbed in any way.I remember reading a poll asking what people thought their chances of dying from Covid were.  Most people (non-elderly with no comorbidities) gave answers two orders of magnitude higher than their actual chances.  Humans are notoriously bad at risk perception, but FB and media ramp up the fear to play with it even more.I never read news on social media. So many false information on there. If I really want to know what is happening out there I just go to the legit news websites. The most concerning part is that People read false information on facebook and spread them around to other social media platforms.And those that listened to Trump are REALLY fucked.[removed]So I should listen to CNN and CBS only. Got it. Thanks.  I feel much more iNfoRmeDReddit was pretending Covid was the plague for months so I'm not sure I'd class any social media platform as a good source of information.\u201cTrusted news source\u201d such a thing does not exist> Our study is limited by a lack of racial diversity or urban representation.\n\nSad that every author feels the need to drop a line like this at the end.

Now you have people treating them like magic in that you need to keep wearing them when after you're fully vaccinated.There is more false information here on Reddit.[deleted]I just took one of those.

The last time I checked fb it's just baby pictures and guitar videos. Does it look like Reuters to other people?People failing the tests: \"These tests are run by the deep state!\"\n\nUnfortunately, none of this helps in convincing the people who need to be convinced, and the rest of us already knew they're cultists.There are no Facts on Facebook.\u201cTrusted News Source\u201d??

Care to share a few?Something I noticed when reading this. \n\nPiece of information directly from this article. \n\n> Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. (False\u2020) (20)\n\nYet the cdc is still recommending masks and requiring it on transportation. \n\nMaybe the lack of knowledge is not a so much a problem with Facebook in this instance but the general incompetence of the people seen as experts and the information that they provide that seems to change on a daily basis.Facebook was a mistake.Facebook is not news. Even if it says news feed it is not news. I call cocaine news but guess what it's not news.Most people suck at answering questions like this no matter what they read. But the difference is one group is overtly proud of their ignorance and wear it like a badge of honor. Facebook grads if you will.Facebook is targeted misinformation masquerading as a news source.Facebook, a brain damaging virus.Only the history will show how \u201ccorrect\u201d the answers really were.These low N non peer reviewed works are super pernicious.

News and journalism is in its death throes because they are rage bait or poltically slanted to one side or the other you dont get actual information and facebook never ca red to do anything but get you to click ads in the first place. Twitter too. Hell Reddit is full of misleading headlines aimed primarily at getting likes by sharing something that subreddit wants to hear.[removed]I would like to see the surveys questions.Facebook is a social cancer[removed]and who decides what the correct answers are?Close your FB account now. Do a favor to yourself.\n\nEdit: typoAnyone that gets their news from Facebook is stupid, lazy, not serious about getting credible news, and needs education about Facebook's business plan.  Selling your data is the least of the FB evils.  FB pushes news stories that you like.  So if you like conspiracy theories,  you're going to get more of those.  It's the rot behind society's hatred of truth and credible news.Does it say anything about people who use r/science to shape their political views?Please check me if I'm being dumb here:\n\n>\\*Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. (False\u2020) (20)\n\nI'm not able to find anything on the CDC specifically about healthy people wearing masks, so checking my (non-facebook) knowledge that I haven't updated very recently:  healthy people don't benefit significantly, but still benefit slightly (like 1-2% reduced odds of catching or something insignificant).  And I'm guessing the CDC doesn't say it that explicitly because people confuse \"healthy\" with \"pre-symptomatic\", which is one of the more important times to be wearing a mask.\"Trusted news source?\" No news source is truthworthy. Maybe Glenn Greenwald has integrity.[removed][removed]How do you determine if a news source is trusted? It doesn't sound scientific.Facebook just needs to be broken up, should have been done 5 years ago.Ah, yes, the floor here is made of floor.Wow, what a finding. What's next, weight correlates with what you eat? Fitness correlates with exercise? Keep it coming.You have to be a moron to use facebook as a information source.  /FacepalmThis probably says more about the type of person who would admit to using Facebook as a news source than anything else.What a perfect coincidence with this post. I was having a conversation with my mom and she concluded that people my age are more likely to believe fb articles than people her generation (I\u2019m a millennial and my mom is gen X) - all this after telling me how she saw a post on fb which said that AstraZeneca\u2019s name means \u201cweapon that kills\u201d and that is why she won\u2019t take the vaccine, among other reasons... fmlFacebook is a cancer. It\u2019s responsible for so much of the misinformation that\u2019s circulating nowadays.\"The test is rigged and just a tool of the democraps to trick their low iq and illegal voter base to keep trusting low rating CNN and FakeBook.\"\n\n- A conservative somewhere right now, probablyPeople who use Facebook ...Dumber in every way,Facebook is a societal cancer and every single person who works there and has other comparable employment options is deeply immoral[removed]Such a good study.\n\nNow here's a question: Who made the questions?  What did they consider the \"right answers\"?  The actual right answers or the same answers the \"trusted news sources\" were saying?\n\nIf you make a study about answering the same things a certain group is saying, comparing people who listen to that certain group vs the people who actually do research and listen to more than just their opinion, you'll obviously get the results you wanted.\n\nWhen 3 actual doctors go on youtube to talk to an actual politician about the pandemic (and YT pulls down that video), does that mean the actual words of actual professionals telling you the actual science would be considered wrong according to this very accurate test?[deleted][removed]My uncle doesn't even have Facebook and he has some of these facts engraved in his head. Shits wild[removed][removed][removed]It almost like F is positioned for idiots who believe anything in internet. No way!Okay\u2014now do other topics. The results probably won\u2019t be too far off.We just need to axe social media. It was a bad idea in the first place. The only non-destructive case for its continued existence would require so much regulation its users and operators would never tolerate all the rules, let alone implement/follow them correctly.Stay from FB, it\u2019ll rot your brain!

I feel much more iNfoRmeDQuitted fb, that\u2019s why I\u2019m hereWait a second here..are you telling me Russian spam and propaganda isn\u2019t the truth?!?And who is defining what the correct answer to a Covid-19 question actually is?  You are saying there is a single point of unbiased truth?  Not hardly.people who use facebook for news would argue that they answered the question correctly, but that the test was wrong.  Really it's not just facebook, though...if you use any social media site for news, hell if you even use just one single media outlet for news, you're going to get inaccuracies.\n\nAll sources of information are worth research, ALL information must be vetted.I'd love to have this, but with YouTube.I use Telegram to read news on official channels of news websites which is much more reliable. Facebook is mostly used by me for contacting persons, organisations and companies whom contact number I don't have and it is also used for wishing people on their birthdays. Reddit is another news source but I find Telegram much more convenient and reliable. I hope my banks will start providing their services on Telegram too, currently they support WhatsApp for communications with their customers.You guys still use Facebook? That was so 2020 and before. Time to delete!I often wonder how I am gonna teach my future kids how to use the Internet properly and learn to learn in the Internet. My main approach will be to create a big, exhaustive Power Point and hope it works.\nA collaboration for something like that would be quite nice.I wouldn't be surprised if people who use FB for anything are less likely to be correct on most things.Why am I not surprisedOooo what an interesting post to farm.

Question 10 as seen in figure 1 in that article is as follows:\n\n>Healthy people should wear face masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19\n\nThe correct answer was FALSE.\nInteresting.People with more than one phone are more likely to answer the same questions than people with two phones.[deleted]Facebook is a cancer on humanity.Hm, sure, depending on what you think the \"correct\" answers are ... I can't believe these sorts of studies regarding a topic where the \"correct\" answer changes basically every day. No matter what you \"believe\" or which \"camp\" you're in. Science is an evolving matter. What is true today can be outdated tomorrow. And yes, this has happened and is still happening with everything regarding Covid. This \"study\" serves one purpose only: to incite more division instead of unity. Despicable. Social Media posts spread misinformation ... but it doesn't matter who we're looking at. Everyone does it.Hope Reddit doesn\u2019t go that way. Bet it will tho with the new majority share ownership :/TV news as source also didn't do well, the results look as bad as Social Media as a news source like FB. Dr Twitter, Dr Youtube and Dr Facebook censored information. Propaganda was pushed and was not consistent with information from the CDC or the WHO. \n\nThe Media this week \"CDC risk of getting Covid on surfaces low\" one year ago on the CDC's website: \"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says the coronavirus \u201cdoes not spread easily\u201d through touching surfaces or objects.\"Where can one find this,' trusted news source' you speak of?This probably correlates to any facts, most of the world thinks memes by their favorite influencers are news.I'm not going to lie, n=5948 sounds like an extremely small sample size for Facebook users.I only use Facebook as an additional source of information about just how terrible people really are. To think people had these insane thoughts in their heads all along and we were all oblivious.They should broaden this because you can find contradicting arguments and facts from any news source this day and age.Heres some news off a moderated censored website about how the news on another censored filtered website is a poor choice to get news. \n\nPeople, its not the secondary source that matters but the actual source. If it fell out my butt but was a peer reviewed journal, its still a peer reviewed journal that came out of my butt. \n\nHello clown world, Im watching you.In this day and age, truth is relative. These morons think Newsmax and Uncle Bob\u2019s Facebook status are trusted news sources.What is a \"trusted news source\" in 2021?  It seems like every one has its own agenda.Those questions are... Questionable at best.Which covid info are they going with?  Since it\u2019s changed over time again and again you could prove anything. Anyone else old enough to remember that masks were only for medical staff? Ha!Those who consume only approved sources have approved knowledge and give approved answers.Tell me which news source is trustedHow do you teach \"correctly\"? What is the hard science and what entities are putting forth the facts?First off let me say that I've gotten my vaccines and did so without hesitation when they became available. I also have no issue wearing a mask when in public. \n\nHaving said that, the CDC and Dr. Fauci haven't exactly helped when it comes to clarity during the pandemic. I think the scientific community shouldn't be pointing fingers at outside sources (which were admittedly really bad) until they fix their own issues.So people who read government websites are most likely to know what government websites say? Not exactly suprising.It's funny how people have always claimed the media to be spreaders of misinformation and lies and manipulated...and now the largest source of misinformation is through Facebook which allows people to spread news directly to eachother.How likely were they to catch covid?What about those who used Reddit like us?It's the top news source. It's not news. It's a piece of paper. This is a big issue.Soooo FB makes people dumber....got itGreat, i am going to share this on Facebook.Let\u2019s study Parler/Gab usersIs it just me or has this sub become much less about scienceAccording to the NYU-based group, Cybersecurity For Democracy, far-right accounts known for spreading misinformation are not only thriving on Facebook, they're actually more successful than other kinds of accounts at getting likes, shares and other forms of user engagement.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/03/06/974394783/far-right-misinformation-is-thriving-on-facebook-a-new-study-shows-just-how-muchI was 21 years old when my friend told me we are in the age of misinformation. 10 years later, and I still believe him.Only COVID-19 or any newsworthy topic?Isn't this a circular study?Hey, those FarmVille invites not looking so bad now huh.This not surprising at allHow is \u201ccorrectly\u201d decided?

How about you make decisions best for you and let everyone do the same and not grade everyone as correct or incorrect on something that has no definitively correct course of action?Thank you for sharing this!Typical Reddit trash\n\nHere was the finding:\n\n- \"In summary, adults whose most trusted information source is government health websites are more likely to correctly answer questions about COVID-19 than those with another most trusted source. Individuals whose most trusted source is television news and those who use Facebook as an additional source of news are less likely to correctly answer COVID-19 questions.\"\n\nIt was basically anyone who relied on non gov health sites - be it TV news or Facebook.Some of the correct answers are funny:\n\n> *Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. (False\u2020) (20)\n\n>*A vaccine for COVID-19 should be available within approximately 3\u2009months. (False) (26)\n\nThe first one is arguably true. The second one, while not exactly true, is actually much closer to reality than \"expert\" predictions indicated. Anyone remember 12-18 months timeline being extremely optimistic?\n\nLooks to me like they were measuring who is more likely to listen to the \"experts\", rather than who actually holds true information.As /u/everythingiscasual pointed out-\n\nMost education systems train kids to accept what they\u2019re told and move on instead of encouraging skepticism.\n\nWinner winner chicken dinner>(n=5,948)\n\nWhat does \"n\" mean here?So only one social media platform was included in this study? What's the purpose of this study if all social media platforms are not included?It\u2019s bizarre having been on Facebook in 2009 and using it as a new alternative to MySpace along with everyone else I knew, and seeing how abysmally far it\u2019s fallen since. It went from being a social platform, to being a gargantuan incubator for some of the worst aspects and traits injected into our societies, while leaking / selling your personal info to boot. It baffles me that despite Zuckerberg\u2019s blatant unwillingness to do anything about any of it, nothing has been done to revolutionize people\u2019s right to their personal info, as well as reign in social media giants and explore ways to reduce the negative impacts they\u2019ve brought upon our societies.A reminder of what reddit looked like this time last year.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fe2oqg/aita_for_sending_my_son_to_school_with_medical/There is perhaps a particular group of people who do not use Facebook.People use Facebook for news?Good going Zuck!

But they kept contradicting themselves. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what lead people to use unreliable sources (i.e. \u201csocial\u201d media), because people are dumb in general. The misleading/false info spread like wild fires on \u201csocial\u201d media though and people won\u2019t use the organ between their ears to do independent research. They\u2019d rather take Mary\u2019s meme as gospel.Facebook is a hungry aggressive corporation who lies to usI was reading the table on what was and wasn't factually incorrect and I read a few that are definitely wrong and I was super confused (ie usage of steroids, people with symptoms should be tested, should healthy people wear masks were all marked as false) and then I saw in the materials this survey was conducted in March 2020. Crazy how much has changed.Under the TRANSPARENCY section they should show the questions and answers.\n\nIm willing to bet a lot of \u201cAnswers\u201d might be highly contested by other scientist.>Those whose single most trusted information source was internet news were similar in overall knowledge compared to those with other trusted sources (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00, 1.17; Table 2). **Those whose single most trusted information source was television news were less likely to answer questions correctly than those with other trusted sources (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83, 0.91).** Those whose single most trusted information source was government internet news were much more likely to answer knowledge questions correctly than those with other trusted sources (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.16, 1.26). **Respondents who selected \u201cFacebook\u201d as either their single most trusted source or as an additional information source were less likely to answer knowledge questions correctly (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88, 0.97) than respondents who reported a different primary source and did not to use Facebook as an additional information source.**\n\nIt is odd that they combined facebook as a trusted source with facebook as an additional source without doing the same thing with the other sources.[deleted]That's so awesome to hear something like this is being taught to jr. high/high school age kids.\n\nAbout a year ago I tried to pitch a *single lecture* on mis/disinformation in health care and my administration shot it down.[removed]When I was in 10th grade and got my first computer in 95 (an old machine still on Windows 3.1), my parents told me that since anyone could just put anything on the internet with no verification (unlike the news, which was evidently solid and dependable), I shouldn't trust anything I read there. Most of my friends were taught that as well.\n\nNow everyone uses Facebook.There's an app very similar to that for kids. The developer company name is iCivics and they have a bunch of different games to teach kids about different aspects of government and civicsGreat! I introduce this topic with students drawing a picture on each other\u2019s backs (on paper). By the time the 3rd student draws the image on the board, it looks much different than the original showing how information changes from the original (primary literature) to news article and then again to meme, getting worse and worse the more it\u2019s cited. Great example is a study that said covid reduces sperm count, a news article said the scientist suggested freezing sperm before getting[vaccinated](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.local10.com/news/local/2020/12/20/study-investigates-effects-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-male-fertility/%3foutputType=amp). Two completely different statements. \n\nI then use a google form to have students fact check two science related statements once a week. We then discuss how to search the internet effectively and reliably and also get to learn fun facts about biology at the same time!Teach Facebook abstinence to kids.

Some medical studies with very dire risk of bad outcomes if there is an error might use a lower alpha of 0.01, but 0.05 is pretty standard for this kind of social question.A p of 0.025 is pretty much always permissible to reject the null hypothesis. Typically anything less than 0.05 is acceptable (though some studies decide to tighten the margin to 0.025, 0.05 is more common in psych and neuroscience research at least). It is certainly cutting it close though.>\t1) One of the questions is: \"Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\"\nAccording to the study, the correct answer is False (which facebook users mostly got wrong).\nGiven what we know, would you agree that the correct answer is False? I am not a doctor, but I'd answer True.\n\nIt\u2019s even worse than that. Their justification for this is that was the official answer according to the CDC website on March 25, 2020, when the survey was sent out. So they\u2019re claiming that people who primarily get their news from government sources are more likely to answer questions correctly based on government guidance, whether or not it\u2019s right.> 1) One of the questions is: \"Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\"\n> \n> According to the study, the correct answer is False (which facebook users mostly got wrong).\n\nYeah, this is a very problematic question. There is a very technical case for the answer being false, because a truly healthy person need not wear a mask. The issue is that there are two more relevant questions:\n\n\"**Apparently healthy** people should wear ...\" (this by the way is what many people may assume the question is asking). \n\nand\n\n\"**Prudent public policy is that all** people should wear ...\"\n\nThe answer to both of these of course is **True**.So wait, healthy people shouldn\u2019t wear face masks in public to help prevent the spread? \n\nI know the question presented to participants didn\u2019t include \u201cin public\u201d but seems like a reasonable inference. \n\nDoesnt wearing a mask by healthy people help prevent the spread by reducing people touching their face/mouth, and prevent spread by people who are asymptomatic or who have it and haven\u2019t shown symptoms yet?[deleted]Completely agree.  I also say something recently that was a poll of TV News watchers and like 60% of respondents thought if you got Covid there was like a > 50% chance of getting hospitalized or something\n\nI forget the exact numbers but it was basically the majority of the population was off by a factor of 50Not relevant to the rest of your comment, but you just made me realise it's not \"burying the lead\". I thought it meant hiding the \"lead\", as in getting rid of evidence that would lead someone towards finding out the truth. TILOne interesting aspect of this though is that these populations are not demographically identical - so there is some self-selection going on. \n\nPeople who ONLY watch television news are significantly older, and likely lack computer skills. \n\n\nMeaning, I'm not sure if the conclusion says more about the media channel vs the people using it.Yup. Study already seems suspect to me. They clearly have an agenda here, which is to bash social media. TV was likely worse, or at the never least, no better than social media. \n\nAlso very curious to see what these questions were. I\u2019m skeptical about what kind of \u201cobjective\u201d questions they were asking, when to this day we are still lacking a ton of data and are still working off of hypotheses as to what works.The survey was done in March 2020 when the CDC did not recommend masks for healthy people. This tripped me up too. It's in the footnotes of the table.I'm also really curious about if they thought COVID-19 was the virus or the disease caused by the virus. Seems like even science-oriented news sources equate COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.I agree with most of what you said. P values are very subjective and p <0.025 means that if we run this study 100 times, we would get the same results 97.5 times. Usually the cut off for significance is around p<.05 but it\u2019s so arbitrary.\n\nIf you\u2019re a pharmaceutical company and you want to make a small effect look extremely significant you can just increase your number of participants. So the effect can be absolutely minuscule and not even clinically significant but on paper it can say p<.001 \n\nSo really it depends on strength of association and N. \n\nI\u2019ve seen really convincing studies with 22 participants with a p<.000001 and that research seems to suggest significance. Whereas pharmaceutical studies that help patients marginally can appear significant.\n\nI\u2019m rambling at this point but we should question the arbitrary cutoff and also how money can make it easier to find significant results if you look hard enough and recruit enough people.> \n> \n> Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 **False**\n> \n> Currently, the CDC recommends that everyone with COVID-19 symptoms should get tested. **False**\n> \n> COVID-19 testing is not recommended for individuals with no symptoms, even if they were exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19 within the past 2 weeks. **True**.\n\n\nThese are ... interesting.  \n\nI understand these were at the time.> 10.  Healthy people should wear facemasks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 - False\n\nThese people and their misinformation...\n\nThis makes the whole study seem awful.\n\nThe people who had the correct information which is now accepted were misinformed becaue the mainstream guidelines at the time were different?Jeez, that's a difficult test. My Facebook studies really didn't prepare me.Asking anyone who hasn't worked in an ICU about how to treat ARDS is ridiculous.What\u2019s funny is the CDC and the WHO would have failed this test with how many times they flip-flopped on policy. Maybe they should get off Facebook.Thanks for this info. It seems there should be a follow up study to see if people follow the scientific method when getting information on Facebook.Number 7 is a terrible question. Compared to what? Compared to 85+ year olds or Compared to 15-20 year olds?\n\nIf I'm not mistaken I think children under 1 had a higher rate than ages till maybe 35+?\n\nEdit: from info I've found my above statement is wrong, but my point still stands. It could be lower depending on what specifically you compare against.Facebook is what forwarded emails were 20 years ago.[removed]It\u2019s an echo chamber that you self assemble\n\n\n\n\n\n^Although ^I ^guess ^reddit ^is ^tooSo even trusted sources would correlate with increased incorrect answers when compared to themselves?Yeah, I hardly even get on Facebook anymore.Actually, there\u2019s a sub called /r/science that would be a perfect sample for the long term effects of editorialized confirmation-bias pop sci articles.People usually like random FB pages or groups over time. These pages/groups will post random editorialized half truth articles from somerandomwebsite.com and then your racist uncle larry posts along with some colorful language.Yeah I don't get it either. I guess I could say I get news from Facebook because I follow pages like The New York Times and NPR because they post links to their own articles.It probably has a lot to do with the fact that most people don\u2019t actually read the shared articles, they just read the title and comments from other peopleMemes and infographics maybe? I know some people who definitely never read past a headline so a certain kind of infographic with a wall of text presented as fact and a little url at the bottom that no one follows would count as news to them.Yeah, I've always wondered this myself. I've turned my Facebook into a literal news feed. I scroll and it's just a stream of news from NYT, NPR, BBC, The Hill, Washington Post, etc. So I imagine I'd be one of the outliers who does get a lot of news \"from Facebook\" but, since it's actually real news, I'd probably be able to answer the questions correctly.It\u2019s based on if the respondent perceived themself as getting most of their news from Facebook. Yes, it\u2019s as weak as it sounds. Combined with the fact that respondents were formed from a convenience sample and you got yourself some purely circumstantial data.   \n\nWhat\u2019s funny is their own study showed that bias towards trusting \u201ctelevision news\u201d actually had the highest impact on their knowledge test, with television underperforming even facebook; but the study clearly has a motive against Facebook. This is why pseudo-science is so dangerous because without any statistical/scientific literacy amongst Reddit users, r/science mods can keep posting politically motivated fake studies to reinforce people\u2019s opinions.> \u2020Correct response according to information publicly available from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control website as of the date the survey was distributed (25 March 2020).\n\nThey added this footnote. This was conducted in March of 2020 when the general public was still being told not to wear masks.Also most questions have a \u201cshould\u201d in them and hence aren\u2019t facts. Another silly question is \u201cincubation period is up to 21 days\u201d which they code as false but I would say it\u2019s true, unless they want to argue that the incubation period routinely exceeds 21 days. In general, the conflation of CDC guidelines with facts is infuriating, when the CDC was wrong on most key issues for many months (airborne transmission, masks, fomites, ventilation), in comparison to public health officials in Asia who are actually competent.[removed][removed]BuT fAcEbOoK iS wOrSe. Followed by some pseudoscientific article based on a study of a couple hundred students with loosely defined tests. Ironically posted from reddit.You are smart you should start a podcast so I can get my info from you easierIt is but with a deeper divide between the ideological wings. Facebook demographics slant older and generally more politically moderate. Reddit is home to more radicals of both inclinations, due in part to a younger user base. \n\nGranted, this is just my subjective experience but news from Reddit tends to be easier to glean truth from because the sources literally force their bias down your throat. Its easier to pick apart opinion pieces and see where the facts overlap between radical right and radical left sources than it is with better funded mainstream sources that have literally billions of dollars to spend on obscuring truth and pushing a narrative.\n\n\nEdit: sources for FB / reddit demographics \n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/376128/facebook-global-user-age-distribution/\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/261766/share-of-us-internet-users-who-use-reddit-by-age-group/[removed][removed]Seems like this post itself is a good example, according to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/mpbd8m/people_who_used_facebook_as_an_additional_source/gu93qpc/)Pause and notice that we've all been reprogrammed since the time of the survey to consider \"healthy\" as \"assumed healthy\" rather than \"actually literally healthy\".\n\nIf someone is actually literally definitely for sure healthy, they do not need a mask, even now.  That is true.\n\nHowever now there is no such thing as that sort of healthy, because we're to assume everyone is unhealthy.  Sort of like assuming everyone at the airport is a terrorist until proven otherwise by TSA...Agree, I think it's a little odd. \n\nIn theory, a healthy person shouldn't need to wear a mask, hence the answer. The problem is there is no way to tell if someone is asymptomatic without a test, they may think they are healthy, they appear healthy, but they aren't. In that case, our imo, healthy people SHOULD wear a mask in case they are asymptomatic.\n\nI also have issue with the timing of the survey. If it was performed a year ago, it was difficult to have any accurate info on Covid at that time. It was new, it was spreading like wildfire, I'm not sure we were even asking the right questions yet to get the correct info we needed. Although better to get info from a reputable source, like a health organization, that was even questionable at that time as well (at least here in the US because it was filtered by the administration). I think now we have more accurate sources to go to, but whenever there is a \"frenzy\", you have take info with a grain of salt, it's preliminary, it may change, even from a reputable source.Context matters. In March of last year there was a mask shortage. Do you think, at that point in time, it would have helped to prevent the spread of COVID-19 if a healthy person who was not likely to come into contact with the virus took a mask away from a front-line medical professional who was dealing with COVID patients all day? No, that would most likely not have helped.\"Most of the rumors came from where people live.\"I come here mostly to revel in the conservative butthurt when the mismatch between their views and reality hurts their feefees.[removed][removed]Did you even read the study?It still is...Half a million dead is not a plague? *Edit* that's just the US not global.I tend to agree.

The illiterate naysayers on this sub are so predictable.No, don't be dense\n\nI understand medical journals are harder to access and navigate for the average Joe but the average Joe doesn't really need to keep up in that regard because honestly they're much easier to read and access for someone actually in the medical field. \n\nThere are outlets and sources that will write articles, however, that will further explain and simplify important issues being posted in medical journals, and cover relevant topics about things like the science of spike proteins and mRNA. Investigate and research independently from qualified sources until you're satisfied you understand what you sought to learn.>mocks people for falling for fake stories\n\n>genuinely still believes the russian bot stories.Your argument is a straw man.Real change for the better cannot be made on the base of assumptions, the more scientific info about things you have, the betterplease say you wear a mask...Did you even read the study?Did you even read the study?Currently (procrastinating) a paper on the importance of Media Literacy for my M.Ed \n\nIt\u2019s so crucial now.[deleted]I don't think any amount of vetting will be of much use. Nearly half of the USA thinks using evidence is political and has a track record of ignoring science for the past several decades. \n\nThe largest issue I see is how to deal with indoctrinated idiots that do not care if what they believe actually matches with reality.The news used to tell you that something happened, then you had to decide what you thought about it. Now the news tells you how to think about something, and you have to decided if it even happened.My English teacher way back in the 90s taught the first media literacy class at our school.  It raised an awareness in me that I am eternally grateful for.  I question everything. But I'm also able to accept reality and facts, and parse news from opinion.\n\nBut I still get suskered sometimes.Critical thinking/logic skills is just the broader category of what you said, so I\u2019d say critical thinking and logic skills are more important, since then you can use the skills to have media literacy, but then you can also apply it to other things.This is 100% true. Media literacy is irrelevant if there is no media accountability. When most of what we're presented with is misinformation, then even the most skeptical among us will be deceived\n\nTo add to this, corporations have huge advantage over individuals. They have financial incentives (increased revenue, user engagement, etc), expertise (there are literal classes taught on media psychology, and corporations have enough money to higher leading experts in the field), and reach (even if some of us are experts in digital literacy, corporations can just focus on reaching everyone else).\n\nMore than media literacy, need media accountability. And I'm including social media in this too. All of it.\n\n(just to be clear, I do think we need media literacy as well. But it's moot if we don't have media accountability. It's just another area where we blame individuals for their \"shortcomings\" but never addressing what led then there in the first time. It's like blaming someone for falling into a pit but never asking who dug the damn pit in the first place.)I would agree with media literacy and add how to (or spend more time teaching how) effectively read scientific research studies/journal articles and how to determine legitimacy and how it can be used as a tool to manipulate.  Public health should also be interwoven in highschool curriculum.An entire generation went from \u201ccan\u2019t trust anything on the internet\u201d to \u201cwell this Facebook article says\u201d in less than 10 years.  Shits insane.>It doesn't matter what it is.\n\nI feel that this collection of words doesn't communicate your thought very effectively.   If you replaced the second \"it\" that would help.\n\nAgree that source vetting is more important.  We know lots of background on who \"Anderson Cooper\" or \"Tucker Carlson\"  or \"The BBC\" is so if each of them report \"The Chinese vaccines aren't as effective as Pfizers\" we can judget the motivations and decide to accept that fact or not.  But people know nothing about you or I or randomers on Reddit or Facebook so cannot judge our trustworthiness or motivations.    But how do you solve that? - require a state-authorised bio on every user instead of pseudynoms?Sadly the cycle will continue since social media is also profiting from it. The best way is to forced open soirve algorithms, make a moderator and vetting team and have a system to show additional news and information alongside the news being read before the user clickbl on it or there a trust raiting powered by croudsource system. as well fine social media companies for allowing misleading information into the platform.I'm not surprised at all. My wife gets an enormous amout of push back from a handful of parents. One parent in particular has independently post almost every example of misinformation she has provided to her class.[removed][removed][removed]>Now everyone uses Facebook.\n\nThis is the problem.I was also told never get in cars with strangers but now Uber is the only way to get anywhere.Yeah, that was the received wisdom, and then as the internet matured and recognisable brands arrived, and new ones built, it sort of blurred that message I suppose. I'd totally forgotten that it was what everyone thought back then, that the internet wasn't trust worthy. Things like don't put your real name on it, don't buy things, don't build friendships with people because they're just out to scam you.\n\nMy guess is that as trustworthy things came online (Tv channels, your school, banks, etc) people dropped their guard. That's pure conjecture on my part though.iCivics was founded by Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor!I saw this happen yesterday on reddit.\n\nA post from conservative linking a \"news\" (you never know) article that said that, in cities with BLM protests, the rate of violent crimes increased.\n\nI got curious, thinking how this information was being spun and where it came from.\n\nThe article cited another article from another (a little more objective) news site. The title was already completely different. \"The effects of BLM protests\".\n\nIn this second article they cite, quote and properly reference the original scientific paper which, surprise, mainly focused on the effect on police violence in cities with BLM protests.\n\nThey found that the rate of homicides BY THE POLICE decreased in cities with the movement.\n\nThey also found, incidentally, that violent crimes increased but, without much more data (because this latest finding was not the initial focus of the study), could only make a hypothesis as to why.\n\nThe strongest why was police taking a less pro-active stance in the midst of the social climate created by the movement (police doing their job LESS) and people having diminished trust in the police, so resorting to their help less frequently.\n\nThese two factors coupled resulted (they theorize) in a temporary uptick in violent crimes.\n\nSo we go from BLM decreases the rate by which police kill civilians and creates and furthers a climate of negligence and mistrust in the police to BLM is bad in three links.\n\nEdit: grammarThat doesnt solve anything. As far as I know kids dont use FB much any longer. There will always be new cool site. Teaching them how to deal with them is much more valuable than prohibiting one site...We\u2019ve that abstinence only education doesn\u2019t workShe wanted the underlying message to be that social media is a net detriment but her administration felt that was a bridge too far.Kids aren\u2019t on Facebook nearly as much as 40+.

These comments sound like the nonsense she's already covering with her students.Don't like it?[removed][removed]I\u2019ll add, most pupils come out of high school and don\u2019t even understand how student loans completely work. By the time they do, they\u2019re already in debt.You realize that school systems around the country are cutting social studies programs to push reading and math because they need to meet standardized testing goals, right?[removed][removed][removed][removed][deleted]This whole study is a perfect example of why scientific literacy is so much more important than so-called \"media literacy\". Media literacy doesn't help when the most reputable websites are amplifying expert claims that are scientifically unsubstantiated. What does help is a healthy skepticism of any claim made by any source (no matter how credibly) which doesn't have scientific data supporting it.I don't believe that any definition of \"healthy\" includes \"not an aymptompatic carrier of any pathogen\".  That would exclude every person alive, if it were even measurable.  So I don't think your technical case is even valid.\n\nAnd that's not even considering the fact that a mask does help slightly with preventing acquisition (though much less than it helps to prevent spread), especially indirectly by blocking the mouth from absentminded contact with your hands.And you also have to consider the possibility of healthy people picking up the disease from someone else.\n\nEarly on, it was established that masks help prevent an infected wearer from spreading it to someone else. But it wasn't clear early on that masks help protect a healthy wearer from getting infected. Later, this second thing was shown to also be true.\n\nDuring the time when it wasn't known for sure whether masks offer the wearer any protection, you have to ask what \"should\" means.\n\nDoes \"should\" mean that public health officials say it's necessary? If so, for a period of time, the answer would have been no, you don't need to.\n\nOr does \"should\" mean that common sense tells you it can't hurt to wear a mask and it might protect you, so it's a good idea?\n\nAlso, what about the fact that random strangers you encounter in public don't know whether you're healthy and don't know whether you should be wearing a mask? Even though a healthy non-mask-wearer is not creating a real risk for them, they are creating an awkward situation. So \"should\" could be interpreted as asking whether it's a good idea to cause needless problems and annoyance for others.How could you even make a policy differentiating between \"apparently healthy\" and \"healthy\" if symptoms are all anyone can go by?\n\nAlso, masks do reduce inhaled pathogens when worn by healthy people. This wasn't some sort of ground-breaking new science as Fauci had claimed. The studies date way back to 2010 and earlier, when they were studying similar viruses like influenza and SARS. The entire claim that masks are useless was just a piece of misinformation that got amplified by some rather reputable media sources. What we need is scientific literacy, not \"media literacy\".In March of 2020, when this survey was made, the cdc was actively recommending healthy people to not wear masks. The common thought today is that they wanted to ensure medical staff had access to masksMy layman's understanding: for most diseases, healthy people wearing masks doesn't do much to prevent the spread and still costs resources that healthcare workers need - but the problem is,  for COVID-19 with such a long incubation period, you can't _tell_ if someone is healthy or not, so better for everyone to wear one.Worse, OP is a mod as well, so naturally all their garbage is right at the top.what.  you've used \"lead\" in ways that remain unclear\n\nlead as in metal\nvs\nlead as in a horse[deleted][deleted][deleted]> If you\u2019re a pharmaceutical company and you want to make a small effect look extremely significant you can just increase your number of participants\n\nThis is a misleading way of framing it. It's not just playing tricks, there's real information gained there. What looks like a small effect with a low sample size may turn out to be no effect at all with a large sample size. If the small effect persists with a large sample size, you know that there actually IS an effect rather than just an apparent effect from random noise.March last year, there was serious rationing of tests and masks in the US.Correct responses at the time, despite some being considered laughable now. \n\n\"COVID-19 knowledge correlates with \"Trusted News Sources.*\"\n\nIts a bit dystopian in some contexts. I was wearing a mask and encouraging others to do so in early March 2020 and got in trouble at work for \"making people scared\" etc, because 'The News disagreed with me.'\n\nImagine if we'd taken the paranoid conspiracy theorist approach of masking up and staying apart back in March, in some of the hotly-hit areas. Things might've been different. Maybe not.\n\nBut the whole \"TRUST MEDIA CONGLOMERATES\" bit is a tough pill to swallow for me. Sinclair Group and all that.\"Correct response according to information publicly available from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control website as of the date the survey was distributed (25 March 2020).\"I don't even make political videos, I do gameplay, back then before the first case was spotted in my country (Brazil) I made a video playing plague inc, talking about this new virus, telling people to be careful saying it's a virus, there is no way to \"cure\" it really, that we'd need a vaccine for that, and meanwhile people shouldn't gather in parties, and probably should watch their higyene, wash their hands often, etc...  \n\n\nBut it was way before the world media even realized this thing existed, because they are all mental midgets who don't do any research at all, so my video got permanently demonetized and all of it's reach was cut off simply because I was saying common knowledge ahead of time.  \n\n\nAnd what's funny: If they had done the test back then, comparing the answers the WHO were giving out to what I was saying, which we know to be true today, they would show on these \"research pieces\" as proof that people using the internet are poorly informed too.  \nPS: Check the questions and answers in this \"study\"So, really what they are saying is that people who relied on news sources other than Facebook and Television talking heads were less likely to believe the abject falsehoods the public policy people were telling. There are some serious issues with the way this paper is written up.[deleted]\"Correct response according to information publicly available from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control website as of the date the survey was distributed (25 March 2020).\"Taking it absolutely literally of course they don't need to wear a mask SINCE they are healthy as in they are not infected.

And a few people figure out that if they build a big friends list, and then one day set their posts to public, those \"forwarded email\"-tier posts can get amplified by hundreds of shares from their friends, who forward it to even more friends.  But now instead of the forwarded email becoming detached from its source, it carries a link to the account that originally posted it everywhere, so now you have hundreds of people building Facebook pages that do nothing but share these \"forwarded email\" type posts until they build a large following, then start posting links occasionally - some even get paid by fledgeling \"news\" sites to post links to \"news articles\" (which, in these cases, are just poorly-written rehashings of either completely  false information that was already circultating via \"forwarded email\"-type posts or rehashings of existing headlines written with a definite political bias) or they start their own \"news\" site (usually just bolting a blog engine onto a cheap domain name, copying a lot of their initial content from other such sites, and editing their \"About\" page to say something along the lines of \"Here at [bullshitsource] news, we have a vision to share honest, unflinching coverage of current events without the [liberal/conservative] bias seen in establishment journalism\"Whoa. It\u2019s almost as if the one common denominator is that there were certain people alive using technology then who are also still alive using technology now. Like a specific generation or something. Idk, can someone help me figure it out?[removed][removed]I think you got their comment backwards. They meant \u201cnot just covid - all information\u201d, rather than \u201cnot just Facebook - all news sources\u201d.My question is, what the hell is a trusted news source?No, I mean all news subjects that make the rounds on Facebook, not all news *sources*\n\nMatter of fact, im pretty sure there have been some papers on how \" factually informed\" people are based on what news channels and social media outlets people get their information from and iirc Facebook and Fox scored the worstOoh there it is, I don't belong to any groups so I'm just reading what my friends and family are posting. ThanksWhoa, there! As a charter member of the League of Larrys, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to please choose a different name for your hypothetical uncle.So many of the actual articles are paywalled or have an adblocker-blocker tactic, so eventually I quit clicking on them.\n\nAt some point in the 2000s almost every article got read because paywalls weren't a thing and there were no anti-adblock tactics yet.  Information was free and not everyone switched to clickbait headlines (some outlets still had integrity).\n\nNow you can't trust a headline to be a valid summary of the article, and can't read the article (without disabling adblocker - nope - or paying a subscription - also nope) so I guess information stalemate.[removed]So they do a test about something experts don't even agree on, and base the answers on the \"official\" answer which is what the experts who happen to work for the CDC say not what others do.

Correlation is a perfectly good conclusion.Not at all.  Learn your fallacies bro.I'd be interested. I mean, where does one even learn Media Literacy without it being biased in any way, shape, or form? I mean, bias is a problem in any form of learning (especially schools of higher education), but where does it start?That is partly because they didn't have good education about critical thinking when they were younger. Getting that education into kids now (media literacy would be a big part, by the nature of the type of education it causes critical thinking) will allow the country to get better over time.This thread is the perfect example of that. The study found that people who watch news on tv answered more questions wrong than any other group, but the comments are about how terrible Facebook is for misinformation. Reddit is just as bad as any other form of social media, it\u2019s just that the misinformation spread here conforms biases that the majority of people using Reddit have.The media has always been trying to influence you, you just didn't notice it.  People seem to want the simplicity of objective truths and falsehoods, but the world is usually more nuanced.\n\nEven if the media companies did not have corporate (or national) agendas, the people working there still have personal biases.  The consumer needs to think about the news from multiple angles, but also just accept that the opinions that we form from it will not be completely accurate.It always said how to think, there were just fewer sources so it seemed more factual.Blame Hunter Thompson for coming up with Gonzo journalism (the writers opinion carries as much weight as the facts).You bring up a great point about accepting facts. It makes me want to plug my ears every time I hear \u201cdO yOuR rEsEaRcH\u201d from far right conspiracy nuts. They have no idea what that word means and what they actually do is seek out absolutely anything that confirms their beliefs and actively reject factual information, no matter how it\u2019s presented. \n\nIf a person has no desire to discover the best and most vetted information available, there is no lesson that will help. The value of critical thinking and the willingness to change your view based on the best information available should be taught early and often. Otherwise we get Q.How do you teach critical thinking skills? Why wouldn't a section on media literacy provide opportunity to critically think? It's practical application, use the topic of media literacy to teach critical thinking.Sounds like the parents need the class as much as the kids.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]No matter the technology, people will always be the problem.  Anywhere you go on the internet it will be the same as long as there are people out there who can benefit from selling lies.I didn't know that! Thanks for sharing, that's really cool!Avoid sex with bots at all costs.I feel like saying social media is a net detriment in general on Reddit in a thread pointing out that some people fall for false information on social media is hilarious.\n\nSocial media makes it easy for false information to get to people, but it also allows for discussion and spread of actual information. Lack of critical thinking is the issue.[removed]Absolutely! Seems like there\u2019s something sketchy going on with this study.I wonder if all fields of science need to adopt physics 5 sigma approach.  I could even make an argument that given the political implications of different fields of science on things like court cases, laws, and government policies, social sciences need the level of strictness more than physics does when it comes to protecting people from bad science.  If physics decides to declare FTL neutrinos and only realize they are wrong a decade later the impact on people is basically 0.  The same doesn't hold for science used directly in law making, law enforcement, or the court room.Healthy skepticism? That sounds like conspiracy theory talk comrade. Just repeat state endorsed message and do not think about it.> And that's not even considering the fact that a mask does help slightly with preventing acquisition (though much less than it helps to prevent spread), especially indirectly by blocking the mouth from absentminded contact with your hands.\n\nThat's all true and a good point. My brain was not fully engaged when I wrote my comment. I was mostly thinking of an asymptomatic person spreading to others.In fact.. From that date to a year later our nation's epidemiologist (Dr. Fauci) went from saying not to wear a mask to saying \"it makes sense to wear 2 or 3 masks\"You can just say they lied. Because that's exactly what they did. The CDC and surgeon general lied about mask effectiveness to prevent a store run on masks.Dude/dudette, spot on! People can transmit the virus prior to experiencing symptoms of it. And for people that have allergies they might think their runny nose is due to allergies when it\u2019s actually corona, and then BOOM give it to grandma for her 90th birthday.> My layman's understanding: for most diseases, healthy people wearing masks doesn't do much to prevent the spread and still costs resources that healthcare workers need - but the problem is, for COVID-19 with such a long incubation period, you can't tell if someone is healthy or not, so better for everyone to wear one.\n\nPlus, the CDC doesn't recommend guesses. They followed established doctrine and revised instructions once new data was available.\n\nThat's how science works. Start with what we know and make as many changes as necessary along the way.\n\nPeople are throwing tantrums that the guidance kept changing. It's anger in hindsight that the CDC didn't automatically know everything about COVID-19 right out of the gate.The term is \u201cbury the [lede](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bury-the-lede-versus-lead),\u201d not \u201clead\u201d\n\nWe can assume from the context that they were using the \u201clead\u201d that\u2019s pronounced the same way as \u201clead\u201d rather than the metal.Damn. Thanks for the info !Good point, didn\u2019t look too far into it. Cant say I know too much about p hacking since I\u2019ve not really conducted any of my own research.Yup. They were specifically being told not to bother with N95 masks so that healthcare workers could get them more easily, and most places hadn't said that cloth masks were mandatory or even recommended yet.That reminds me of when my SO had to drive my mum to the hospital in the middle of the night last year. She has so many health issues that getting COVID-19 would definitely be fatal. And thus she wore a mask at the hospital. But what did the hospital staff do? They kindly asked her to take off her mask because it might make other patients nervous (?!). \n\nWhen she refused they had her wait in a hallway outside of the waiting room (and then they of course forgot about her so my mum and SO waited for over an hour before they realised something was wrong and had to go ask what was going on...but that's a different story...). \n\nThen when she actually saw the doctor they didn't think her wearing a mask was necessary either. Of course roughly a few weeks later wearing a mask at hospitals (and public indoor areas in general) became mandatory. Oh well.To be fair, I think Youtube demonetized *anyone* talking about it, without difference.The problem is you\u2019re classifying it as deceit when it\u2019s just not. Recommendations were based on the best available information at the time. As we learned more about COVID we came to understand better how to treat it and how to help prevent the spread of it. Rational people understand this is how science works. You start out with an educated guess then research the subject and come to a conclusion. Hell, anyone who\u2019s ever participated in a school science fair should understand this.Yes, and the CDC was wrong.Spam filters were how they did that, but generally they erred on the side of showing you spam rather than hiding the ham, so while the infrastructure was there it never seemed to be used as destructively> Add to that an overlord algorithm controlled by a private company who can influence the visibility of everything shared.\n\nYup. My opinion is that algorithmic selection for news should be completely banned at the very least for all political topics. Ie you shouldnt be sheltered from the other side of political spectrum. But I dont think there is a problem with just giving you sport news about football only.[removed][removed][removed]Possibly. Thanks.Associated Press, Reuters, many (not all) local news outlets: [https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/center/)\n\nThey're boring af (i.e. not sensationalized clickbait), but it's just facts.View more than one source throughout your days. I don't want to list any because you should choose your own, but public broadcasting companies (PBS, NPR, many others) and the outlets that have been around for a century (Associated Press, Reuters, etc.) are often a safe bet.  \n  \nIt will also be labelled \"News\" and not \"Opinion\".The ones that have been around for 100+ years, verify their sources, and largely say what the other matched criteria sources say.Friends and family often repost from these pages/groups as well. That's how the disinformation spreads. Facebook is wildfire for propaganda.Well you\u2019re not paying for the information itself, you are paying the journalists for their job of gathering it and writing the articles - that obviously can\u2019t be free. \n\nBefore the internet, newspapers all cost money, it was completely normal to pay for them. Now nobody buys them on paper anymore, but media still have to get money somehow to function. So more serious redactions turned to paywalls, less serious redactions turned to clickbait.\n\nI\u2019d say the best solution to this is to pick one or two media networks that you trust and want to support, and buy a subscription. This way you gain access to good, non-clickbait journalism and support free press at the same time. As I said, everybody was paying for newspapers not too long ago, and the fact that almost nobody does so anymore is what\u2019s causing all the problems.[removed][removed][removed]Idk where he got CNN and CNBC from other than from within his own head.Sorry I meant reddit is still acting like it is the plague.Conveniently ignoring the primary mode of contracting the virus which is direct inhalation if respiratory droplets.

That is in direct contradiction to one of the correct answers.  Weird.I would have expected most of the population to get these wrong no matter their news source. The CDC and WHO have changed position on some of these over the last year and different governments have different recommendations on things like testing.So is this saying healthy people shouldn\u2019t wear masks?You clearly don't though. https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htmYeah, but some of us understood what that means and some people inferred things that weren't said because they have to make contrarian comments here.There\u2019s the kind of bias you get when the news outlet has a political affiliation or is trying to pander to a certain set of expectations from the readers. You can often balance that out by choosing centrist sources or offsetting partisan sources.   \n\nThe one I\u2019m finding more difficult to deal with is the inherent bias towards \u201cinteresting news\u201d.  Ad-based popular media and even much subscription based popular media, find great value in making their publication interesting.  This skews which stories get covered and how they are covered, and especially the headlines.  \n\nI don\u2019t know how you get past this unless you have the time to drill down into primary sources, or if you\u2019re interested in a very specific area with trade publications aimed at people who have a serious need to get to the actual truth of things. As long as the audience is largely driven by novelty and curiosity and scandal and conflict, you\u2019re not going to get unbiased news.*Understanding Media* by Marshall McLuhan, one of the pillars of the field and one of the greatest thinkers of our time. Too bad the advertisers got ahold of his ideas as a \"how to\" manual rather than the intended audience.[removed]Let be honest, our school system was inadequate when it was still actually training the factory workers it was designed for.I\u2019m convinced that at the root of all this is religion.  The idea of trusting faith rather than evidence is often a central tenet, which sets people up to not think critically, because the institutions themselves can\u2019t withstand logical examination.\n\n Voltaire, paraphrased:  \u201cThose who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\u201dThe study discussion is actually fairly unclear about TV vs Facebook. It says that both TV users and Facebook users are less likely to answer questions correctly compared to government information users. It also states that TV users who supplement with Facebook are even less likely to answer correctly. However it never directly compares TV as a primary vs Social Media as a primary.\n\nI agree. The article title and thread lead you to believe \"OMG Facebook baad\" (it definitely is). But I think the moral here is that any type of media, that isn't a direct source, seems to be misleading.The title for this thread is the perfect example of \"If there is a way to evoke a response in people, someone will take advantage of it for profit.\"\n\nWhat I took from the article is that both television news and sourcing news from facebook led to misinformation, but television was not singled out as being worse. Perhaps I missed something?\n\n>In summary, adults whose most trusted information source is government health websites are more likely to correctly answer questions about COVID-19 than those with another most trusted source. Individuals whose most trusted source is television news and those who use Facebook as an additional source of news are less likely to correctly answer COVID-19 questions.Looking at the results it listed government websites (1.21, p < .05), general internet (1.08, p > .05), then tv news (0.87, p < .05). The results then say, \"Those who used Facebook as an additional source of news in any way were less likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who did not (OR 0.93, p\u2009<\u2009.05).\"  \nTraditional news at 0.87, p < .05 seems worse off than Facebook involvement at 0.93, p < .05. Am I reading this right?  \n  \nEdit, I'm confirming based on your statement saying as much, but the way the results are written makes it seem as if Facebook involvement was categorized differently since it was targeted.[removed]What makes reddit better is that there is posiblity to get more than one opinion about an article without getting it deleted for no reason to make a whole bigger picture of the subject. better not bestAccurate.Reddit you can at least do a better job of crafting your own experience whereas Facebook kind of constantly rams things into you. So in some ways it\u2019s worse and other ways it\u2019s better. You have to be more intentional about creating an echo chamber where Facebook kind of feeds you whatever your chamber is.\n\nThere still has to be some ability to sift information but there are a fair amount of high-quality subs with good information. r/COVID19 was a good resource for me during the pandemic. The more serious subs with tight moderation tend to be good. But I also have some experience with being able to identify and get primary sources and have a decent ability to read studies and such that help.Every clear cut issue was solved long before it became an issue.Even if the media was completely objective, people will still get mad. The outrage I've been seeing over how much the media is \"fearmongering about AstraZeneca blood clots\" makes this pretty apparent: if an objective truth is scary, we apparently shouldn't report on it.That would literally just be one section of the class. \n\nProbably start with math/algebra/raw logic. Then you\u2019d probably learn about logical fallacies, then you\u2019d probably learn about how language carries information...\n\nIdk exactly where you\u2019d go from there, but probably history and/or media literacy could fit in shortly after that.If you consider that education curriculum is continuously improving, they parents will ALWAYS need the lesson more than the kids. It's unbelievable how much of a barrier parents can be because they never were taught what is taught now.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]>people will always be the problem.\n\nWords to live by.Describing something as a **net** detriment specifically does not preclude any benefits from existing.[deleted]This can\u2019t really happen because then the sample sizes you need to conduct social science research would be enormous. Plenty of effects are smaller and it is very difficult to recruit thousands of people, especially for specialized samples. This would make it so only people at the best and most funded universities can do research\u2014which is a bad form of gatekeeping.\n\nThe focus should be on replicability, not on one study with a small p value.I trust the science.I can't tell if you're angry that they lied?  Because they were right to be worried.  I had to borrow TP from my neighbor.TIL!!!\n\nAnd I was in Yearbook and Journalism in high school and worked post-school at several publishing jobs.  Always thought it was \"bury the lead\" like take the leader and bury it so there is nothing to follow.  Had no idea a \"lede\" was even a thing at all whatsoever, which is odd, considering I know a lot of other useless junk about typography.\n\nAlthough the end meaning is the same, muddying the part you're supposed to follow.>most places hadn't said that cloth masks were mandatory or even recommended yet.\n\nNot to mention that just buying a cloth mask back then was still a bit of a challenge. I ended up paying for a few off of Etsy and I paid far too much for something that was handmade and fairly uncomfortable.I like how people think there's some shadowy cabal that knows all literally behind everything. People need to realize the other alternative is the CDC literally says nothing beyond \"We'll get back to you in a year when we know for sure\". And then people would be infuriated that they weren't providing guidance.>The problem is you\u2019re classifying it as deceit when it\u2019s just not. Recommendations were based on the best available information at the time.\n\nI don't quite buy that. They knew damn well there was at least *some chance* that it's airborne. It was unproven, sure... But that means nothing. That doesn't mean you don't need protection-- it means there's no *proof* you need protection, and it only requires a little critical thinking to realize this.\n\nThey knew that wearing masks was the safest thing to do, in the event that this turned out to be true.\n\nAnd if it was normal for every household to have a small supply of N95 masks, I virtually guarantee that early recommendation would've looked different.\n\nE.g. \"there's currently no proof that it's airborne and masks need to be worn, however the possibility exists, so we encourage people with masks to wear them.\"\n\nBut they knew most people didn't have N95s just hanging out in their home, and they didn't want to cause a run on masks, because hospitals etc were already under-supplied, especially in the event that things got much worse...\n\n(And if you read between the lines of some of the public statements, they almost said as much.)\n\nAnd to be fair, that would've been a bad situation, and even as it happened things were pretty bad early on, for professional PPE in some hospitals.\n\nI feel like they carefully weighed the pros and the cons, and made the choice that hospital workers should be prioritized. So they released the statement they did, knowing it might cause some people to be less safe-- believing that was a better alternative than starting to lose hospital workers to COVID.\n\nBecause if they had said \"it may be airborne, so feel free to wear masks but *please leave the N95s for hospital workers*, because they need the *more effective* protection...\" that many people would disregard this advice, and do whatever they could to obtain some N95's.\n\nThat's why we got the statements we did...You have to consider the situation. Masks were in an extreme shortage and hospitals were struggling to keep stock up. When there aren't enough masks for everyone, then it's best to use the masks we do have for the sick and healthcare employees. This bought manufacturers time to kick it into high gear and produce enough masks for the healthy as well. We're now at a point where masks are easily accessible, which was not the case when this was posted.Health authorities deliberately lied to the public about the effectiveness of masks so they could ration them to healthcare workers.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to measure knowledge about covid-19. Most of the survey does a good job of that. However, marking people as correct for believing a lie proliferated by health authorities doesn't measure how informed the participant is about covid-19, it measures their trust of authority, which makes the results of the study less valid.Yeah but why? Wrong by force or ignorance?No, they just didn't have enough masks to go around at the time. The medical staff needed them first.Wrong is not the correct word. They were working off of incomplete information.[removed]I disagree. I news source that has been around for 100 years is in no way better than a news source that has been around for 100 days. It all depends on who is writing the news and what agenda they are following. Framing is happening in pretty much every news article nowdays (probably has always been the case to an extent).  \n  \nThe part about verifying sources is good, but for the \"commoner\" it's still not easy to confirm news, but it helps if you're actually linking the studies (for example) you are talking about, instead of just saying \"take our word for it\".  \n  \nI also disagree about consense. Just an example: Most news outlets in my country get their stories from a central news network. You can basically read the same story 20 times in different national news papers ad verbatim. Just because \"the others\" are reporting the same thing doesn't make it any more true. Especially when it's coming from self-proclaimed \"fact checkers\".  \n  \nThe only thing you can do is try and find out as much as possible yourself from contradicting opinions. You'll find the truth or something approximating it somewhere right in between. e.g. Covid is neither a deadly killer virus that is going to eradicate us nor is it just a common cold in all cases. It's that simple, really.  \n  \nNews also have a very terrible long-term relevance ... the known facts change each day. And I stick to this, because I can see live how the media has changed the tune over the past year. They WANT to sell you what they believe, but WILL sell you what you want to hear eventually. At least most of the big papers do. Whether they are right or left leaning in my country.[removed][removed][removed]https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fe2oqg/aita_for_sending_my_son_to_school_with_medical/\n\nThis would be a fun time capsule for you ;)[deleted]The big conceit of a study like this is presuming that there is an accessible and indisputable truth to these questions. Many of them are judgement calls, and the call you make will depend on who you are. Governments, for example, have different priorities for testing than doctors and testees have.There are plenty of centrist sources that have poor quality information and analysis. perhaps another way of framing it would be widely respected (across the political spectrum) news sources: the Associated Press, the BBC, Reuters, the Guardian, NPR. these are organisations that all have their own biases, but are known for having a good factual basis for their claims, and you can assess what the biases in their analysis might be, from the facts presented.>You can often balance that out by choosing centrist sources or offsetting partisan sources\n\nIf you think \"centrist\" sources don't have biases...I tell people to look for the AP tag.Our school system does a few things fairly well. \n\nWhile not all of these lessons are learned by all, and I certainly don't think all of these lessons are positive, I'd say a vast majority of (western) students walk out the lessons imparted; \n\n* It gives students a place to learn how to interact with their peers positively, and negatively, as well as how social pecking order operates in a semi-contained environment that simulates most working life. \n\n* In addition to the above, it teaches kids that bullies and bullying can be successful regardless of justice or fairness. \n\n* It teaches kids to self limit in the face of authority. \n\n* It teaches kids basic mathematical skills to handle most basic household economic trade (the components of bedmas in a large enough degree to handle working a register and their own basic purchases and savings).\n\n* It teaches kids the basics of literacy for reading, and I'd argue the basics needed for comprehension (although the latter seems often misused these days).\n\n* It provides a place for adults to park their kids while they work. \n\n* It provides exercise opportunities for kids. \n\n* It can spark lifelong passion in various areas of interest, across subjects of the core curriculum and optional (music, law, construction, mechanics, etc - school depending), which we need some kids to gain for future employment.\n\nSpeaking as a former teacher, there's a lot more I think school does do (and reading back, my comments do read rather negatively), but in the face of how capitalist (and most societies) operate, that's pretty much all that the government, whether they are consciously aware of it or not, really cares about. \n\nDo you listen to authority without interruptions? Can you read? Can you understand enough math to pay bills? Were your parents able to work at least some hours instead of watching you? If so, school was a success.Religion is highly problematic but is more a symptom than root of the problem. The amount of non-religious and left-leaning people who are biased in their own ways is a good counter-example. Trusting prior views of our \"tribe\" over new scientific data is a universal human condition, likely stemming from very deep psychological/evolutionary instincts. There was even a study proving this, where offering new data only convinced people to believe in their original belief even harder, didn't even matter what the issue was.One on the challenges is that even if any one source is being fairly even and factual, a thousand sources all saying it at once can can cause an unintended (or intended) amplification effect that makes the message seem more severe.\n\nIf you heard one neighbor say \"someone got hurt at the corner store\" you might wonder if they was a minor accident. If you heard one hundred neighbors come out and tell you it (often in lieu of telling you something else in your brief interaction) you might understandably wonder if the roof had caved in at the store or there had been a mass shooting.\n\nIt's hard to know how to handle this given the mass of voices and independence of each in their decisions. Certainly modern media literary probably needs to include practice at countering that automatic human response when it comes to headlines.The generation that harped on about \"don't trust everything you see on TV\" is oddly trusting about everything seen on Facebook.Depends on the parent.  Those who can afford the time and are also good parents keep up with the improvements on their own.  Some may even have been part of discovering or creating those improvements.[removed][removed][removed][removed]I wouldn't say it is exactly cheap for physics either, yet they have the requirement despite it having so little potential to harm society.Isn't that one way that physics gets to the 5 sigma value, by replicating studies multiple times?  Otherwise how would they account for possible errors in the experiment.  With the FTL neutrino case it wasn't an issue because everyone involved believed it was an experimental error given how shocking the results were, but for far less shocking results it would be a realistic concern.Yeah, I'd prefer it if my government could find better solutions than damaging the public trust in their announcements than deliberately misleading people. \n\nThey could've just had people make their own masks from the get-go, but instead there are clips and clips of Fauci and others literally chuckling and dismissing reporters asking them if people should start wearing masks and then they would response \"oh there's no reason for a healthy person to do that, you're more likely to get sick because you're going to be touching your face more, etc, etc- just wash your hands more\"\n\nThen 2 months later they act like \"oh well we just learned new data, we had **no idea** that the coronavirus could be transmitted from person to person by spitting on them\" like ffs. Then compound that with Trump making EVERY effort to **never** be seen in a mask in public until like June, and even then was like \"oh well.. you know, only if you *want* to\". For whatever reason we decided to convince like 80% of republicans not to wear masks. Absolutely absurd. \n\nAnd then 3 months after that Fauci was just like \"oh yeah, well we were concerned about the supply of masks\"\n\nSo yeah, I'm not thrilled with the CDC on their decision to lie.Ah it's custom and made with love, the perfect memento for your pandemic experience![deleted]That's true, but the survey is marking people as misinformed for saying we should wear masks, and that seems backwards to me.  I know the CDC was recommending against masks *at the time*, but given everything that's happened since then, the question really has hasn't aged well.[removed][removed][removed]Exactly, it is not about centrism or moderation, it is about finding enough evidence to know if a thing is false or fact.What a bleak and perfect description of school and how I felt about it.[removed]Guys I think r/ElimGarakTheSpyGuy might be a member of the Obsidian Order. Just a hunch.[removed][removed]Lab conditions vs social conditions. Once you have all the tools replicating a well designed experiment in the lab is easy in comparison to social science. The cost is mostly in start up. Replicating a social science experiment will require recruitment all over again, which will be roughly the same cost as doing it the first time. In other words for the faster than light neutrinos they didn\u2019t have to rebuild the CERN accelerator, beam current transformer, and OPERA detector to replicate. They already have it.\n\nIn contrast the cost of developing the survey instruments are relatively cheap in social science and only have to be done once but recruitment, delivery, tracking are expensive and have to be done every single time in social science. Couple this with the reality of novel results getting publication preference and you can see pretty clearly why replication is rare in comparison to the hard sciences. There are serious structural issues that need to be addressed.Agree entirely. The language they used in March 2020 clearly denigrated the efficacy of masks wholesale. The movies make the CDC/American health officials look so sophisticated, but in real life they handled Covid like my fraternity did norovirus.Most ridiculous part is Fauci claimed \"new evidence\" but the evidence was there all along way before COVID-19 even appeared, from studies up to a decade old on wearing masks for influenza and SARS. Sure they're not literally the exact same virus but there was some evidence that masks reduce spread of infectious viral diseases in general.\n\nEven if people think that evidence isn't clear, the right thing to do is say we don't know yet whether it helps, not that it definitely doesn't help (the CDC technically didn't say it definitely doesn't help at all, but some experts interviewed by credible media sources did make that exact claim)not just the CDC, but the WHO as well when they started simping to CPP china during the wuhan investigation.\n\nit's annoying when health organizations get political.It took 3 weeks from not recommending a mask to recommending it.  And remember that it wasn't really known how common asymptomatic carriers are.  So it was pretty reasonable at the time to recommend other mitigation techniques rather than create a mask shortage.\n\nIt sounds like you're actually listening to the Republican nonsense that says changing your mind due to updated conditions is a bad thing.>So all it did was majority damaged public trust in the CDC.\n\nYep.  That one stupid decision is going to keep biting us in the ass for YEARS.[removed][removed]> recruitment, delivery, tracking\n\ndoes it need to be expensive though?\n\naren't online surveys that require participants to submit legal IDs for identification be sufficient enough?\n\nplenty of people who are willing participants to social surveys for free.No, I was following the news and just remember. I basically only listened to NPR's up first everyday on my way to work. It took a lot longer than 3 weeks. Not sure where you came up with that timeline. \n\n>changing your mind due to updated conditions is a bad thing.\n\nI never claimed that. I claimed that they knew ALL ALONG that wearing masks was a good idea and instead chose to cast doubt into their effectiveness because they didn't want people to make a run on masks. Instead of saying \"let's make masks and save the N95s for health care workers\"[removed][removed][removed]Fauci said wearing a mask isn't necessary on March 8.  The CDC updated its guideline to include masks on April 3rd.\n\nIf only symptomatic people spread the virus, you can easily self isolate when you're contagious.  Having everybody wear a mask just makes it harder to get for medical staff who can't isolate.\n\nN95 mask reserves were dangerously depleted prior to the pandemic starting.  Many hospitals and nursing homes were using paper masks or even homemade cloth masks when they couldn't find paper ones.[removed]",

With misinformation and things like Deep Fake becoming more sophisticated and prevalent, the concern isn't so much that we won't believe information that isn't true. It's that we'll doubt information that *is* true and will be too caught up in analysis paralysis to tell the difference and trust it.wow, people believe the government until the government lies to them. Who would've thought?So you're telling me the people want a reliable government?[removed]This only works in places with a single-party government, like China.\n\nThe beauty of a single-party government is that the party is always responsible for the good and the bad things. There\u2019s no one else to blame.\n\nIn the US the Democrats will blame the Republicans and vice-versa. Look at how often Trump lies and yet he still has a 93% approval rating from his party, including people he personally attacked or insulted such as John McCain\u2019s daughter and Ted Cruz.This makes sense to me.\n\n\nYou can't just *tell* someone that information is incorrect.  You have to *show* them. \n\n\nCounter bad Intel with good Intel and let people form their own opinions.So it's like if someone were to do exactly that they'd be doing it to sow more distrust in the government?The government shouldn't be playing arbiter anyway. That just sews more distrust and can be perceived as a step towards state sponsored media.[removed](Evidence from China) what does that even mean?[removed]This is only true if the individual values the truth. There are people who only want to hear what they want to hear.This study makes the fact more clear to me that Information Science needs to become a more accepted field in the sciences realm. \n\n>Recent research has shown that people\u2019s acceptance of factual statements and corrections does not necessarily imply changes in political attitudes: Being persuaded of the veracity or falsehood of a government or politician\u2019s specific claims often does not change people\u2019s trust in or evaluation of the government/politician, especially if the factual corrections are simple denials without much detailed evidence or argument ([Huang, 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414020957672#); [Nyhan et al., in press](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414020957672#)). \n\nBringing the topic to the U.S. Election (I can't help it, it's all I seem to be thinking about these days) the Democrats really need to get this through their heads: supporters of a politician don't care if they lie.How is this not just common sense?[removed][removed][removed]We can conclude that citizens are vastly stupidThis sounds a lot like the boy who cried wolfWhen someone lies others tend not to trust them even if they tell the truth. Lying begets cynicism. You don't start off cynical.But what if the citizens are also so dumb they can't tell what's fake and what's not?Let me get this straight...If a news source lies, people lose faith in the news. And if the government lies, people lose faith in the government. Nah, that makes no sense at all.Except in the United States...Definitely NOT true of the US.[removed]I honestly dont believe most news articles that slander or direct blame at someone, or attempt to tell you how you should feel, i view them all as either propaganda or false opinionated articles.Now how much for this to happen before citizens take actual action?[removed]Except Trump supportersThis explains how the right now lives in an alternate reality with little relationship to truth[removed]So when you prove a liar wrong you are less likely to believe a liar.This seems like common sense tbhSo accusing a source of being false even though it might be true causes the citizens overall trust of any news source to decline including the their trust of the person making accusations of false news?? I\u2019m shocked, shocked I saw!!Well, this is the modern version of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" story. The government should know that the shepherd gets eaten by the wolf at the end of the story.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 458,780 times, shame on me.Analogous to this is how people react to tornado warnings. The boy who cried wolf is definitely a valuable story to heed. \n\nI wonder if we could also take the learnings from what social scientists have uncovered in getting people to listen to tornado warnings more seriously. From this article: https://weather.com/storms/tornado/news/tornado-warnings-future-facets-nssl\n\n>The benefits of more\u00a0precise, accurate warnings with increased lead time are immense. But only if the warnings are heeded. That's where the important cog of social and behavioral science comes in.\n\n>\"We have social scientists working with users such as emergency managers and broadcasters to help determine the best ways to convey this information,\" said Alan Gerard, deputy division chief of the National Severe Storm Laboratory's Warning Research and Development Division.\u00a0\n\n>FACET\u00a0envisions the PHI maps and data could be used, for example, to prompt a \"tornado threat increasing\" alert when the PHI threat plume is pushing toward your area\u00a0but not yet close enough for a tornado warning, which would provide valuable extra lead time.\n\nThe gist is that a warning of a potential income tornado warning helps people mentally prepare for a true warning but if it doesn't come to fruition its not seen as a missed call.What if I told you, that sometimes it's very apparently just a single individual within the government, and not always The Government?Isn\u2019t that just how \u201ctrust\u201d works in general?And you have people who think it's cool and hip to be recklessly stupid.Unless it's a two party system. In which case belief in a claim is bimodal based on which party claimed it and confidence in the belief or disbelief is directly proportional to the age of the claim.Ya, but how do we get them to accept that it was true? I think that's been one of the obstacles in America...Which leaves two big alternative strategies for the government in question. Either make sure that the \u201cstory\u201d the next day is always something new - such that the lies of yesterday never get enough focus for the populus to update their belief (US) - OR simply prevent the news entirely from running the story if it is displeasing enough to the government (China)I feel very confident that this same study would not yield those results here.Well that's clearly not the case in America right now. No one cares if it 'turns out to be true'. Perhaps when it starts relating to food and water supplies, people will give a little more creedence to what is true, and what isn't.After all the damage has been the citizens say \"We didn't know\". Yeah,  Thanks! you killed thousands!Makes me remember about this grandiloquent article from The Lancet about HCQ that turned out to be fake and retracted a few days after all the big headlines were already made. That certainly didn\u2019t help.That does seem obvious..and a reasonable response by the citizens...>when boys describe something as \u201cwolf\u201d, citizens act to protect boy from wolf. However, if the call turns out to be false, citizens become less likely to believe future \u201cwolf\u201d proclamations and reduce their satisfaction with the boy. [evidence from Aesop's Fables]I cal BS because the exact opposite is happening in the USSo your telling me people are less likely to believe you after you tell them something incorrect woaaahhh doood my mind is getting blown right nowBig problem the U.S. has is 1/3 of voters watch Fox \"News\" which comes with almost no credibility and absolutely no responsibility. 30% of this country will never know the truth and will admit they don't care.Oh yeah. I\u2019m sure China comparable to USA. maybe in 2021.Sadly there is so much garbage \"news\" out there it's hard to tell what is real. You need to spend time fact checking everyone anymore to get some straight news. No one is unbiased maybe they never were.I feel like your assuming people haven\u2019t already made up their mindsSo what's happening in the US.Garbage. This conclusion cannot be taken a universal fact of human nature; only as generally true of the particulars population (people in the specific time and place) that was studied. Some individuals know better than to trust (today\u2019s) governments in the first place. It\u2019s just a matter of learning the right ideas.The mainstream press has continuously hurt their legitimacy with tons of stories like WMDs in Iraq, among others. This is just the natural result.Wow who would have thoughtIdk, when i hear Putin or anybstate run media say \"fake\" i tend to bet my life that the news is realExcept that theory doesn't work with the Trump base who believe him no matter what the facts are because they really want to suck up everything he tells them.Reddit promoting disinformation & hoaxes:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1ByJXuZ.png\n\n>\"**we consider ourselves not just a company** running a website where one can post links and discuss them, **but the government of a new type of community.** The role and responsibility of a government differs from that of a private corporation, in that it exercises restraint in the usage of its powers.\"\n\n>https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/I\u2019d be happy if more people didn\u2019t trust the government. It\u2019s interesting to see Reddit be a big government friendly place with support for executive powers up until Trump came inThe fact this is from China makes me skeptical. With how the people are raised there, they'll turn in their children, parents, spouse and dog over to the government before they risk breaking the law. I want to see this in somewhere more relevant, such as the US or UK, although having a wider sample area in general is better than just China.Why should we think that this generalizes across different cultures with very different relationships to their governments, media, and truth?The Facebook said this \"fact\" was fake and was made in a socialist lab and beamed over 5G. Masks are stoopid but tinfoil hats (/S)ave lives!I wish it worked like that in Brazil.I don't believe this. QANON.\nThe more things that turn out to be lies, the more my folks double down on believing the Almighty God put him in office to raise up the greatest country on Earth.\n\nThis report assumes people believe the eventual evidence. They don't. They just go deeper down the rabbit hole.I don't exactly believe this...\n\nSource: Trump supportersThat\u2019s nice that it works like that in China. In America not so much.. as evidenced by Trump trumping along.What if the story itself was true but wasn\u2019t really a newsworthy story. In other words a non-event sensationalized and designed to provoke anger and division for ratings.Not really ground breaking. This works for all events and is one of the greatest thing holding back mental illness awareness. Why because when false statements are given people when knowing that statement is false, not only tend to now discount the source of that statement and all other statements that source makes, but are also likely to then discount this same statement made by someone else. \n\nIn fact the distrust to trust factor is so great that say for example. \n\nKelly know 3 people that have severe mental illness, and have been assisting with there lives for years. \n\nJennifer says she has the same illness, and it bears out to be a false cry for attention, and diverts resources away from Kelly's friends that are suffering \n\nKelly is not only no longer trust comments that Jennifer says, but will now hold a greater suspicion for all cases that seem close to Jennifer's. Even know kelly has 3 prove cases against 1. \n\nThis is how stereotyping and prejudice is carried forward, and is apart of human nature. We as a species do not like to make the same error again and thus now judge all future encounters by a new standard.I see. So if it's not true people don't believe it, and if someone lies people don't believe them. Interesting....Milgram experiments rear their head once again, 50 years laterDoes it ever turn out to be true?A lot of this issue would vanish if the media decided to report the truth, facts only.\n\nThen they would get a long standing reputation for always telling the truth, very difficult to counter from politicians who have a reputation for lying.\n\n\nAt the moment its a situation where everybody lies, media and politicians, and people have no faith in either.Ah, that's why they don't want their citizens to inform themselves properly and block everything that could compromise their bs.I would like to wildly gesture in the general direction of America as a counterpoint.Oh you mean you don\u2019t like it when we just shove out opinions with no fact checking?TL;DR: citizens don\u2019t like it when the government lies to them.how do citizens determine if it turned out to be true?Tl;Dr people don't trust liars.How could any reliable data on people's opinions of the government and state media ever be collected in China?That doesn't work in Brazil.It's true. The American Gov't telling people that masks don't work has undermined their credibility (instead of telling us to wear alternative fave coverings). Now they're telling us not to get tested after you come in contact with someone that has covid... \n\nSuddenly I'm having a really hard time believing in anything that comes from the top about covid.This is why every single lie republicans tell need to be brought front and center and corrected at every moment and if need be in the future to ensure every single thing they say is fact checked and proven to be a lieLike how redditors discuss complicated misinformation like machine learning.\n\nWhile here you can just post title that directly contradicts source it itself refers and still none bothers to check it, especially in political threadsSo why is America immune to this instinct?As an american I wish that were truedoes not seem to work on trumps core demographic though?Living in the US right now this seems like the opposite of trueWell it seems some countries work a bit differently.CNN destroyed their own credibility.The journal of common sense would also tell you this.So the title is just gonna tell the story of our slow growth of distrust of the government that has certainly already taken place in many placesUnless you\u2019re a trump supporter, then you double down.How is social science considered science?[removed]Exactly. People are more intelligent than given credit for. We don\u2019t need professional people like in George Orwell\u2019s 1984 to tell us what\u2019s true or not.Tell that to the current cabal of trumpers.Shouldn't we call it lies from the media or something a bit more direct rather than perpetuating this dumb phrase?Evidence from a country currently at war with its authoritarian government...\n\nThe USA has proven time and again that this claim is false.China seems like a bad place to use as an example when their media is controlled by the state.Is China primed for this?  Tiananmen Square was covered up. Not that the narrative shifted, but people were told it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nThat\u2019s a big lie. \\[Evidence from China\\]\n\nChina?! FAKE !Comparing the US to China is not really a good proxy. China is literally a fascist state, according to a former party insider. People in the US might not like Trump but the country is far from fascist.[removed]...unless you're a Trump supporterChina doesn't have a rapidly growing religious movement akin to QAnon though.So it's okay to trust China now?\n\nJust kidding, because it kinda sucks having to trust international sources when I can't even trust my own government.The trump 'good people' and 'drink bleach' lines being trotted out to this day, along with 'systemic racism' has just discredited anyone who keeps saying it.This is why you don't accept news from your government.\n\n\n\nLeave it to the professionals.This is pretty dystopian in the end: they are conducting research in order to reach maximum trust from citizens to a government. Thoughts?Not entirely correct, I am too lazy to typeUnless you country is filled with trumpanzees.  Then human logic doesnt work.y\u2019all had to write a whole article just to say \u201cthe boy who cried wolf\u201d?You needed a 'study' to figure this out?  Who the hell funds these?And this is front page news?New study finds humans do in fact exist.Yes. 1+1 does equal 2, very goodGovernments? I though just one asshole was doing this?The thing is, this thing claimed humans have basic common sense which I am not so sure of\n\nsaying \"people will not believe you if you lie to many times\" is not a statement that is true anymore[removed][removed][removed][removed]I think it's like how any other sort of repetitive lying affects your reputation.  Eventually, the liar's opinion isn't relevant.  \n\nSadly, that doesn't mean that there won't be support for a serial liar, as long as the serial liar is saying things the supporters want to hear.What if the government does the opposite and claims something is real but it turns out to be fake? Do the people believe the lie then, once they find out it's a lie, stop believing the truth?Like ol' G W would have Said it \"There's an old saying in Tennessee \u2014 I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee \u2014 that says, fool me once, shame on \u2014 shame on you. Fool me \u2014 you can't get fooled again\"Maybe the media should give a lot more publicity to news that turned to be true, making the government be impacted by false claims.Yeah, but it's also a classic tactic to spread confusion. \"The media is the enemy of the people\" strategy to cover any bad press about you in the futureI swear there is a story about this I read somewhere when I was a kid.Recycled proverb.Fool me once....The unsaid moral of that fable is that the boy should never have been made to take care of those sheep by himself (and at least by himself). \n\n... I guess just like how certain individuals shouldnt be in charge of the government...[removed][removed]I mean, it's not that disinformation didn't exist before the internet. It's that it was both harder to spread and harder to detect.\n\nDisinformation wasn't invented in the modern era; it's just gotten better training in psychology and A-B testing.All information should really be doubted. I'd like to think it would make people think for themselves more but maybe they'll just end up picking the one they want to be true if there's no way to work it out (more so than people do now).>It's that we'll doubt information that is true and will be too caught up in analysis paralysis to tell the difference and trust it.\n\nOr maybe news outlets can do a better job. There's a front page article from the BBC about leaked SARs from banks and how it shows banks supposedly engaged in \"corrupt actions helping criminals move money\".\n\nDo you know what SARs are?\n\nThey're **Suspicious Activity Reports** ***filed by the banks themselves with law enforcement*** in compliance with their anti-money laundering obligations. What was leaked was LITERALLY the bank's compliance with laws. But the BBC has twisted it as though it shows banks engaged in unscrupulous behavior. THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE, but this isn't it. This is literally the opposite of it.\n\nDon't believe me? This is what the BBC *itself* says:\n\n[The FinCEN files are more than 2,500 documents, most of which were **files that banks sent to the US authorities** between 2000 and 2017.](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54226107)\n\nBut what do their headlines actually say?\n\n>FinCEN Files: HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning\n\nand\n\n>FinCEN Files: Sanctioned Putin associate \u2018laundered millions\u2019 through Barclays\n\nand\n\n>FinCEN Files: UAE central bank failed to prevent sanctions evasion[removed][removed][removed][removed]yeah makes sense. I've lived in a 'single-party' country and nobody believes a single word the government says. there's no other side to take or blame.\n\nhuh, is this why in the novel 1984, the all powerful government had Goldberg, a public dissentor and rebel who was surely a puppet-but served as a patsy for everything wrong.\n\nMaybe 'two party' countries are doing something similar>This only works in places with a single-party government, like China.\n\nGot any proof for your claim?   \n\n\nI would imagine that once trust is lost its hard to regain even for different parties. If we look at [Pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/pp_09-14-20_views-of-government-00-8/) we can see trust has declined over the years and while trust does go up at the start of each parties rule the overall trend has been down.\n\nRegarding trump, you are conflating his approval rating with trust. Looking that graph, Trumps government only has 25% trust amongst republicans.Look how many times *any* politician lies. Not just the right. Not just the left. Them all. All of the shittiest profession in existence. As they constantly blame each other and then make it so there is no accountability.> You can't just tell someone that information is incorrect.  You have to show them.\n\nYeah, that's working really well to counter the anti-vax and anti-mask movements in America.  Asia and Asians mask up all the time, no virus.  Americans double down with \"their numbers are fake\".well thats what propaganda is[removed]Data set was from a chinese population.[removed][removed][removed]You'll find common sense isn't so common.Checking obvious stuff is an important part of science because sometimes things that are obvious turn out to be wrong.[removed]But too many people thought the media was lying when reporting lies from politicians.[removed]Individuals are quite sensible but its when people form groups and allegiances that they abdicate their reason and become a mob. They will believe their side's narrative while being incredulous about anything that goes against it.[deleted]If they were people trump would no longer be president.[removed]As part of doing Open-Source \"community\"-type work, I've talked with people born and currently living in China, and some genuinely had no idea there was any controversy about this. \n\nOne, in particular, knew of the Tiananmen Square self-immolations but had a near-perfect / fully memorized narrative of the official position ( they were terrorists and crazy religious zealots, trying to hurt Chinese people for crazy/no-good reasons, etc ), which is pretty obviously not the case if you actually look into it with an unbiased source of information, like Wikipedia, to which they didn't have access.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen\\_Square\\_self-immolation\\_incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_self-immolation_incident)\n\nMass-brain-washing / propaganda seems to work very well, especially in cases like this where it starts right as education starts, and never stops, but I seriously doubt they can keep this up forever. As uncensored Internet access becomes easier and easier to access, I expect things will at some point devolve into student protests, mass strikes, etc, and the Chinese gov will be less severe in their punishment than they were decades ago, and all that will slowly progress towards more and more democracy and freedom for the Chinese people ( as we've seen happen in lots of places these past few decades, Democracy is on the rise, has been for a long time )[removed]It used to. Some \"reeducation\" fixed that.No one is actually saying he said to drink bleach.  That's called \"exaggeration.\"  He did, however, suggest researching injecting disinfectant.\n\nAnd he most definitely said the \"good people on both sides\" line when referring to the group marching while chanting, \"the Jews will not replace us\" and the person who rammed his car into a crowd of people in an act of domestic terrorism.  You know, the good people who stood with that crowd.I don't know if I'm the stupid one, but this title is literally just logic writtenNo one is referring to this as a revelation.Sometimes scientists try to prove what's obviously true. Seems dumb, but there are times when the obvious truth is actually not true at all. So rather than just going with out feelings, we can gain evidence on things, and then go with that.[removed][removed]>I think it's like how any other sort of repetitive lying affects your reputation.\n\nSo, like crying wolf?\u201cEvery lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later that debt is paid.\u201dI think it's more serious than that. The effect is to erase the distinction between truth and falsehood, and get citizens to disengage from the news altogether. Then they're passive, and that's what authoritarian regimes want.[deleted]Or if he's doing some things those people want. I've met several people who knew Trump was a lying idiot, but they want conservative justices and tax breaks, so they put up with it.[removed]I\u2019d argue GWB caught himself from creating a bigger gaffe. It\u2019s a rule of power to never admit fault. The follow up of \u201cshame on me\u201d, would be tantamount to admitting fault.[removed]Hence the quotation marks.  That's how they are properly used.Shame...shame on you. Shame...won't get fooled again!The famous literature critic Elim Garak suggests the lesson is to never tell the same lie twice.[removed]I actually wasn't talking about the US or authoritarianism at all, but okay.\n\nYour last line though, I agree with. People like to think that their point of view or belief is right, and especially in this online age it's pretty easy to find a likeminded people, no matter what for. *Everyone's* guilty of it, myself included.[removed][removed]That's a big aspect though. You wouldn't say \"it's not that transport didn't exist back then, but it's just a lot faster now\". \n\nThere is a giant leap between flight, bullet trains and horse carriage. Hyperboles *do* matter, they change our lifestyles fundamentally. \n\nBecause of planes, international business is possible. Because of highway, people don't stay in their hometowns.\n\nYou're kind if downplaying the fact that mass spreading a lie is more harmful than a lie going mouth to mouth.So, if someone says \u201coxygen is necessary for your survival\u201d it should be doubted?I want to modify that to all information should be doubted to the extent that it's appropriate to (meaning given the sources and the context).[removed][removed]Small correction, it is Goldstein not Goldberg.At the same time, I've seen one of the functionally single-party countries attempt to create a Goldberg, or at least \"adopt\" a few. A frighteningly large amount of people go with it, hook line and sinker, but then again, they would be OK with anything marginally believable.Can the single party not blame the other eg Jews or the Japanese?That means at least 68% of Republicans don't trust Trump but still support him?Most people are trustful to medicine and vaccines. \n\nI think the facts are working.The CDC also started by telling Americans not to wear masks.\n\nThe fact that some Americans double down on these conspiracy theories is actually evidence of the exact effect the linked paper is talking about, having already happened: it does not pay in the long-run to take an authoritatian stance on information dissemination.\n\nJust because you don't like how long it's taking some people in the world to drop irrational beliefs and become perfectly scientific thinkers...doesn't mean an authoritatian alternative would be better.\n\nIn fact there's a few social science disciplines which studies this...but you seem unaware of their findings and prefer what seems like a belief along the same lines as the antivaxxers or flat-earthers.

Eventually, the liar's opinion isn't relevant.\n\nSadly, that doesn't mean that there won't be support for a serial liar, as long as the serial liar is saying things the supporters want to hear.Does it really work in the context of our modern world though?A large majority of ppl are pretty disengaged in the first place. They don't care about political matters and just want to live their life. For the ones who are engaged, nationalists won't disengage from the news and people who lose trust in the government will look for other avenues for info. \n\nFor China, they have control over all media platforms within their country. So the group that \"learns the government is lying\" is a small minority as most people don't bother accessing conflicting or differing perspectives and those anti-government viewpoints are also blocked/censored. Furthermore, there's so much conflicting news out there that people tend not to read enough or think enough to decipher between which info is real/fake and end up sticking with their preconceived bias.\n\nThere are also methods in twisting logic and news so that the government's viewpoint doesn't seem fake, even when conflicting evidence or reason is presented.\n\nI would also say that there are also a lot of things Western media gets wrong, but get presented as facts. When Chinese ppl see this, it reinforces their trust in the government and distrust in foreign viewpoints.And Gorsuch, a principled strict textualist dealt them defeats in many a case, Bostock v. Clayton County (LGTBQIA+ are protected as a logical extension of sex, discriminating against them necessarily discriminates on the basis of sex, which is illegal explicitly based on the original statute),\n\n Sessions vs Jimaya and US v Davis (these two deal with the same general issue, that a law must be specific in order to give fair notice (of something being illegal or mandatory or the consequences)), \n\nand McGirt vs Oklahoma (Congress established a reservation and despite weakening tribal protections, never eliminated it, therefore it still exists, therefore crimes of a First Nations/Native American involvement, on reservation land, fall under tribal jurisdiction in compliance with an earlier law.)\n\nIts actually sciency in the sense of predictability. Since Gorsuch is a strict textualist, we can use that to predict his opinions in advance, and as it turns out, the evidence supports the hypothesis (If Gorsuch is a strict textualist, as he claims and supported by observation, then he will decide in whatever direction is supported by the plain text of the law). That makes him politically unpredictable, but he excludes politics the most from his decisions.They tolerate the lying idiot so they can get lying idiot justices.Like mye ol' pops told me ; \"it's better with one Bull in a china shop than ten geese in the living room\"Nobody in their right mind would use that as an example of him admitting fault though.\n\nI can see where you're coming from, and it isn't too far fetched, but either way it's a stupid choice to make: Making yourself look like an idiot to prevent someone taking 3 words out of context to make you look like an idiot.I was going somewhere else entirely with \u201cbush in the hand\u201d, I reckon.> The famous literature critic Elim Garak\n\nThe very good tailor, you mean.Because you can vote for people and have a bill of rights?[removed]> You're kind if downplaying the fact that mass spreading a lie is more harmful than a lie going mouth to mouth.\n\nModern problems with disinformation have less to do with mass spread than they have to do with targeted spread. The same algorithms used to laser-target advertising and marketing are also used to target political advertising, both informative and disinformative. The algorithms that generate \"feeds\" of suggested content amplify internal biases, forming de-facto echo chambers that promote viral spread of content (both true and false).\n\nBy comparison: televisions, magazines, and classifieds have existed for a while. It's just that television channels/timeslots and ad spaces were far too coarse to target an audience like \"would believe conspiracy theories about 5G\", and a medium geared toward such an audience wouldn't be socially acceptable enough to be financially sustainable.\n\nThe more focused your targeting is, the more deeply and enduringly you can fool that target audience. And, it's much cheaper.He isn't. \n\nDecades ago media companies making very selective, deceptive edits of interviews was common. I have friends who were subject to it, an acquaintance who did it, and another friend who was seriously burned by it. [Here's an example](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/cnn-sorry-for-not-airing-full-clip-of-milwaukee-sister).\n\nThe difference with deepfakes isn't that it is possible.\n\nThe difference is that a significant part of the population knows it is possible and can act accordingly.Sorta, though I dont think doubt is the best word. \"Take nobody's word for it\" is what OP meant.\n\nSo maybe not today, but if someone said that in the 1700s, youd be right to doubt it.If you doubt it, and then research it to see if it is true, at the end you will have acquired more understanding about the world, and have developed your own critical thinking.  \nNow, of course, if we doubt everything ever, we will never do anything because we will be in constant doubt. But it doesn't harm to quickly ask yourself if that what you are hearing (or even thinking) is true.Everything should be questioned. Go learn about chemistry and biology and see if needing oxygen makes sense. Or read about it enough to see if the consensus supports that and accept what the experts sayyesFor as long as you don't have evidence to back it up, yes. Fortunately, there is a fuckton of evidence that oxygen is necessary for survival.thank you! I should have checked that, it's been a minute since I read it[deleted]That's a major part of facismYes, they can go blame \u2018the West\u2019I guess that's a popular route too. isn't Goldberg a Jewish name? gotta have an other to lay the lies on.\n\nthe country I'm talking about didn't do that either. the rulers are not hated, but they are not believed to any degree. even the government department I worked in used CIA population estimates rather than rely on national census dataI would guess it means they approve of Biden less.\n\nIts the choose the lesser evil troupe. \n\nOr they trust trump as a person but not congress or the rest of the government.There's a special number of people who can protest to start a revolution, it was like 5% of the population or something. That works both ways, and way more than 5% of America is insane.In America, 30-40% refuse to wear masks, despite the obvious medical / scientific benefit.  Only 200,000 confirmed dead so far.In Canada too we were told to only wear a mask if we were sick. Then it slowly changed toward mandatory.Here in Hong Kong, we had the same guidelines.\n\nAt first, no wearing masks because panic buying meant shortages for people who actually needed them.\n\nWe moved towards finding a sustainable solution quite quickly though, rather than being stuck in this limbo of \"it'll go away soon\".> The CDC also started by telling Americans not to wear masks.\n\nYeah, I think that's a factoid that's been distorted to discredit the CDC. The statement at the time was:\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/t0212-cdc-telebriefing-transcript.html\n\n> We understand the importance of providing guidance that health care facilities can implement given the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE supplies.  CDC talks regularly with health care industry partners as well as PPE manufacturers and distributors to assess availability of PPE.  At this time, some partners are reporting higher than usual demand for select N95 respirators and face masks.  **CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public.**  This virus is not spreading in the community.  If you are sick or a patient under investigation and not hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing a face mask when around other people and before entering a health care provider\u2019s office, but when you are alone, in your home, you do not need to wear a mask.  People who are in close contact with someone with novel coronavirus, for example, household contacts and care givers of people with known or suspected 2019, I\u2019m sorry, nCoV 2019, we should wear a face mask if they are in the same room as the patient and that patient is not able to wear a face mask.  Health care personnel should wear PPE including respirators when caring for confirmed or possible nCoV patients because they\u2019re in direct contact with those patients which increases their risk of exposure.  We will continue to work with our public health partners around the clock to address this public health threat.\n\nThat's a lot more nuanced than \"CDC told Americans not to wear masks\". Honestly, the worst error (in retrospect) in the statement would be \"This virus is not spreading in the community\" - without ample testing, the only thing they could safely say is \"there is no evidence of community spread in the US at this time\".\n\nBut there's a clear nuance to the statement from the CDC:\n\n- It's temporary guidance, based on the conditions of the virus at the time\n- The mask clearly has an effect on viral spread, and was recommended for high-risk individuals (both those suspected of virus and those in contact with high-risk individuals)\n- Availability of PPE was a concern, as was the increase in PPE demand (competing with medical staff demand)\n\nOn average, a low-risk individual who (during the supply crunch) purchased a mask and thus denied one to a high-risk individual would probably increase their own chance of getting the virus by increasing spread.\n\nNone of this seems to support the popular (and politically charged) narrative that \"the CDC just flip-flopped arbitrarily\".[removed][removed][removed][removed]It depends on what you're disagreeing about. All they care about is celebrity worship and abortion, then yes they're idiots.what an uninformed statement[removed][removed]> I mean I've had people say it to me in person and I've seen it numerous times in media.\n\nIf they are saying it as if that is what he actually said, then those people would be either completely misinformed or morons.  \n\n>He also at the same time said that racists/white supremacists are repugnant and clearly denounced them at the same time. \n\nYea, and when he goes, \"yea, they're terrible but there were good people there!\" then everything before the \"but\" is meaningless.  It's like saying, \"I'm sorry, but...\"  No, then you're not sorry.  Same thing here.\n\n>If I was a local protesting a statue being removed(of which there were many), then I would expect to be considered a good person.\n\nIf I was a local showing up to protest a statue being removed, showed up, and found a bunch of skinheads with swastikas on clothing, flags, or tattoos, marching while chanting, \"the Jews will not replace us,\" that would be my queue to get out of there and reevaluate what life choices I made to get to the point where these are the people on my side of an issue.\n\nSimilar to that, remember a few months back when Sasha Baron Cohen performed at a right-wing rally, and got progressively more racist as he went to see how far people would go with him?  At first, the crowd was with him.  After a few mins, the more sane people said, \"wait, this is going a direction I don't want this to go,\" and left.  There were still a disturbing number of people happy to chant along with the horrible things he was saying/singing, but by 6-7 mins in, the crowd had dwindled greatly.\n\nSo why are you trying to pretend that people who chose to stick around with that crowd and those things going on are \"good people?\" They had plenty of chances to realize how terrible of a group they were with and didn't get away from there.  \n\nFor that matter, other than pandering to hate groups, what did trump have to gain by the \"both sides\" line?  He could have simply said, \"the people chanting that stuff and the terrorist ramming his car into a crowd are disgusting and that's not what we stand for\" and left it at that.  But he didn't.  He made sure to throw a lifeline out there to the various forms of nazis, white supremacists, and those who stand with them, that there's good people there.\n\nAnd then people like you spend years defending that.[removed][removed][removed]Just by the decline of Trump signs, it is pretty much not true. The titanic is turning around.[removed][deleted][removed]Exponentially.> Furthermore, there's so much conflicting news out there that people tend not to read enough or think enough to decipher between which info is real/fake and end up sticking with their preconceived bias. \n\ninteresting. I mean, objectively the better thing to do here would be to simply believe nothing, discarding any bias. In truth, I think a fairly large proportion of the people in China are aware of manipulation of information in state media (if not necessarily the full extent of it), which probably explains why society there is becoming increasingly disengaged - turns out that, faced with constant lying and omissions, people just stop caring.Stop imagining the complexities of a country of 1.4 billion people from 10,000 kilometers away. Ordinary Chinese don't have much faith in what the government says, and the Chinese are smart not your fantasy fool. The Chinese have always been suspicious of what their government says, but after decades of rapid development, the vast majority of Chinese believe their current government is not good enough, but far better than the Western system.\u201cLotion in the basket\u201d[removed]That's a very valid point. Echo chambers are dangerous because simply more people = more power.Isn't speed and accessibility a huge factor?  \n\nIf one can just spread the earth is flat by simply sending a message, isn't that efficiency more dangerous than a local mad man shouting it?\n\nNot to say manipulations or lies didn't exist though.>\"Take nobody's word for it\" \n\n*Nullius in verba* is the motto of the Royal Society for good reason.A highly specialized economy such as ours requires trust in experts. Scientific, educational, and social advancement requires  it as well. Choosing not to rely on trust is not the answer; we need better methods of establishing trust.>So maybe not today\n\nOnly because conclusive evidence is more readily available, NOT because it's the scientific consensus.The issue with that approach is that the world is noisy, the newsfeed is noisy, the everything is noisy and we cannot possibly research every claim that is made. We dissect so much information every minute we spend on social media and newsfeeds that adding more information is just as likely to confuse and fatigue than it is to clarify.Hungary. Functionally, because the traditional opposition parties basically all but made a pact with the ruling one: a bit of cash-flow for absolute majority. The sufficient-for-many Goldberg is a rich and extremely unpopular opposition ex-PM, the adopted one is Soros most of the time, sometimes \"the EU\" (even though we are part of it) or even more simply \"the West\".Well there are a lot of racism and prejudice against China in the media.  Everything you read/see about China in the \u201cwestern medial\u201d is negative.  Lots of unreferenced no evidence and random footage can be used to weave a fake story to push this agenda.  Most of the people that say a lot of crap about China have never been there, don\u2019t know the culture and don\u2019t know the people.  They just take the hate that is fed to them spew it back out.Potentially they approve of how he runs the country whilst believing that he will lie to the public (and thus them), ergo they are willing to approve of an administration that uses lies to achieve aims they agree with.Source?I guess my point (which I didn't seem to communicate clearly, based on the comments of others), is that regardless of whether government authorities change their recommendations/edicts because of understandable evolving data, or based on negligence in their due diligence or bad-faith political reasons: you have to understand that these recommendations or rules have a totally different character in the minds of citizens, because they are backed by force or threat of force (unlike, say, if everybody's family doctor had send out a newsletter suggesting that, based on what they currently knew, it was not recommended to wear masks; and then later rescinded that) ....and frankly, I think this reaction is not only understandable, but correct: whenever you are going to use force to make people follow experts, you do and should have a *much* higher standard of evidence and rigor in methodology, and a much more careful campaign to inform the public of your reasons and reasoning for forcing people to do something...because, as the person I responded to even said: most Asian countries have been wearing masks for a long time and had seemingly good results across a number of their epidemics...so when you have the CDC (just to pick on one of the many communication blunders of the u.s. government during thjs crisis) telling people not to do what seems like common sense to protect themselves, just so that there's enough PPE for medical workers (when that same government was exacerbating the shortage with anti-gouging raids and such)...then yeah, you're going to have reasonable people and wackos alike, losing trust in government experts and even going off into conspiracy theory territory about why they changed their tune, etc.I think the following sentence should be highlighted, too:\n\n>  CDC does not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general public. This virus is not spreading in the community.\n\nIt's obvious that this recommendation was outdated when it spread in the community.I just want to add that, at that time, there was not sufficient evidence for the protective effect for the mask wearer based on experiment data for flu. Maybe you can add that to your post.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]can't unpack the intended meaning of this comment, but trump\u2019s approval ratings have remained remarkably stable. if u were suggesting he's losing his base over his lies, then i dont think that can be backed up by anything 'scientific'Something like 90% of Republicans approve of Trump and he still has the support of 42% of the electorate. The only ones who have moved over are the Obama/Trump \"independents\" and suburban \"never trumpers\".[removed][removed]\"Hose again\"Spending too much time with people of your own opinions will make your opinions more extreme.  You need and should surround yourself with opposing views just to stay grounded and well rounded.I can't think of any better method of establishing trust other than those experts proving themselves trustworthy by being right.If it helps, I can breathe oxygen.The only reason you know the evidence is conclusive is because it is the scientific consensus. Do you really think your individual interpretation of evidence is more valid than the scientific consensus of tens of thousands to possibly millions of people who spend their entire life studying a specific topic, who's entire goal in life is to make a huge change to the scientific consensus so they can be remembered for doing so for eternity, who for some reason all agree with other people's consensus? No scientist gets any benefit from agreeing with someone else's consensus to a topic they spent their life on. It's literally the exact opposite of any scientists dream. Think of all the famous scientists you know and tell me how many of them are famous for agreeing with a consensus that existed before them. That alone should be strong evidence in favor of the validity of scientific consensus.I've done this approach several times. The problem is it takes months of hard research to come up with a real answer to even a fairly simple question. This does not help if my question is time sensitive.That's what I said in my comment. \n\n>Now, of course, if we doubt everything ever, we will never do anything because we will be in constant doubt. But it doesn't harm to quickly ask yourself if that what you are hearing (or even thinking) is true. \n\nI'm not saying to go investigate every claim made, but, when you encounter any claim, to ask yourself if it's true, instead of blindly accepting it. This simple question, and reflection, can help not only to increase your critical thinking, but also to deepen the thinking we do on social media, instead of just consuming everythingLearn how to say 'I don't care.'\n\nProtest about a murder on the other side of the country? Doesn't impact me. I can't do anything about it. Protesting the thing here won't reach anyone who *can* do anything about it.\n\nDo I need to have an opinion on Angela Merkel? About the internal politics of India? Brexit? None of those things impact me except tangentially, and even so there's nothing I can do to affect them, nothing I can do to prepare or anticipate their possible effect on me which other local actors aren't going to do better and more accurately.\n\nErgo, why allow that stuff to take up my limited monkeyspace of concern and add to my stress?[removed]Regrettably, I can't visit China, because under the recently passed Security Law, Chinese Authorities have a legal precedent to detain me based upon the fact that I have voiced any form of dissent with the CCP.\n\nI mean, I doubt they would pick up random people from the street simply for voicing dissent, but I would rather not take any risks, 2020 is wild enough as it is.\"About two-thirds of US adults say they regularly wear a mask\"\n\n* https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/23/most-americans-say-they-regularly-wore-a-mask-in-stores-in-the-past-month-fewer-see-others-doing-it/\n\n\n\"The US Has Reached the Grim Milestone of 200,000 COVID-19 Deaths.\"\n\n* https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/09/200000-coronavirus-deaths-experts-done-differently/The one who downplayed the virus while fully knowing how serious it was and causing thousands of needless deaths. The one who doesn't give two shits about anyone but himself. You would have to be a complete and utter moron to think that narcissist cares about anything other than lining his own pockets. I worry for anyone's sanity who can watch him talk for more than 10 seconds and not recognize him for the used car salesman conman that he is. You have to be blind not to see it.[removed]There's less Republicans just more percentage hardcoreThe thing is that there are fewer people who identity as Republicans now. This happened with GW too.\n\nHe has 42% of people polled who tend to be \"likely\" voters. People who have been identified as already having voted and who were registered previously.\n\nThere is a whole generation voting now that does not get these calls and who would not answer them if they did.\n\nThere are many people who haven't voted in years who will be voting this year.\n\nWe saw this in 2018 as well.\n\nI don't think you get just how badly Trump is hated at this point.[removed]\u201cRub it\u201d\"Woman suit\"It's true. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to even hear things you don't agree with.This is perhaps the best answer to the noise problem.Security law is not for random people who say they hate the CCP.  Have you read what actually the security law says?  It\u2019s a law that is targeted toward organized crime against the government.  Which I\u2019m pretty sure every country has.> Overall, 65% of U.S. adults say that they have personally worn a mask in stores or other businesses all or most of the time in the past month, while 15% say they did this some of the time. Relatively small shares of adults say they hardly ever (9%) or never (7%) wore a mask in the past month, and 4% say they have not gone to these types of places.\n\n7%+9%=16%, that's not 30-40%. Even if you add the people who sometimes were masks (which isn't a refusal to wear them) you are just  reaching the 30%.[removed][removed]So, really, it\u2019s that whack jobs can now find each other en masse, globally...People overestimate and like to make themselves sound better.\n\n100% - 65% = 35% == 30-40%.If they didn't wear a mask once they were probably out licking railings!",

    "Comments": "[removed]I've been waiting for this to hit the mainstream - Fun! Been monitoring these [pre-publications](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1) for a couple weeks now. \n\nThis isn't much of a surprise, since cats (and ferrets) are especially susceptible to their own coronavirus (enteric coronavirus and FIP); however, all of the reports I've read only detail cats being susceptible to COVID-19 but unable to transmit it. These cases are likely a 'reverse zoonosis' where humans are transmitting COVID-19 to cats, but they are unable to transmit it back to us - so far. One study used a small group of cats and inoculated them with a heavy load of viral particles, and found that naive cats exhibited respiratory signs. The big cats at the Bronx zoo were super interesting, and I'm waiting for more of that story to come out. Who was in contact with those cats?!\n\nThere are a few groups out there utilizing [ferrets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=covid+ferret) as an animal model to recapitulate human disease. Looking forward to see where that goes. \n\nSource: Boarded veterinary pathologistI read the study. Here\u2019s the TL;DR:\n1. They didn\u2019t test older cats. They used two age groups: juvenile (70-100 days old) and subadult (7-9 months old). Some of the juvenile cats developed \u201cmassive lesions\u201d in the nose, trachea, and lungs. So actually, the younger cats were worse off.\n2. They didn\u2019t report symptoms. At all. No idea if the cats got a cough or anything. \n3. They tested dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks too. They\u2019re all good to go, no worries.There's already a confirmed case. A tiger in the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for the virus this week.My aunt cat has severe pneumonia right now. It might be a coincidence and it caught something while going outside. But I learned that my cousin tested positive for COVID-19.Could this make cats very sick and die from it ?[removed]For the people looking for symptoms in their cats, also keep in mind that cats can suffer from allergies and it's allergy season. Watery eyes and sneezing might be explained from that.[removed][removed][deleted][removed][removed]>Neither Nadia nor the domestic cats studied \u201cactually ever acted terribly sick,\u201d Bronx Zoo veterinarian Paul Calle told the Times.\n\n>An experiment in a lab \u2014 like injecting a big dose of the virus through a cat\u2019s nose \u2014 \u201cdoes not replicate what is happening in people\u2019s homes around the world,\" Calle points out.\n\n>In fact, cats may not be \u201cgenerally susceptible\u201d to getting sick from the novel coronavirus...\n\nSince they decided to bury this bit at the bottom of the article.I\u2019ve been sick for three weeks. The cdc site ofc said that pets aren\u2019t likely to get it\n\nWhen I am sick my cat screams to come in and sleep in my bed. He\u2019s been with me through this whole thing\n\nNow I read this.[removed]I[wuhan cats](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.021196v1) \n\nInteresting study of cats in Wuhan showing they developed antibodies to Sars-coV-2[removed][removed]I feel like a lot of cats are about to end up in shelters or killed because of this information and I\u2019m real sad about that :-/[removed][removed]Just wanted to clear this up, the Inverse article says \"**Older cats** may be at particular risk...\", as the title here suggests, while the actual article in *Science* says the opposite: \"These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in cats, **with younger cats being more permissive**...\".[removed]I don\u2019t really buy into this. If it were the case hundreds, if not thousands, of cats would be infected worldwide by now.  There was also something on NPR yesterday about it and in a lab they had to give domestic cats an incredibly high dose for them to catch the virus.  https://www.npr.org/2020/04/06/828517076/a-tiger-has-coronavirus-should-you-worry-about-your-pets[removed]What should I be cleaning my house with to keep my cats safe?Omg now I have to worry even more about my cats??? One of them already has health issues. I don't know what I would do if anything happened to them. :([removed]This is infuriating (in fur iating?). There are idiots setting fire to 5g towers because they think that's where the corona virus came from. If I hear of anyone hurting cats I'm going to be patrolling the streets, lockdown or no.Welcome to r/science!

We encourage respectful discussion about the science of the post.[removed]It should be noted that this is NOT a reason to dump, or kill your pet, or drop it at a shelter!\n\nThere is only one confirmed case of a pet cat in Belgium.This is so strange.  My wife and I live in Queens.  Both had mild colds last week (cough, headache, muscleache), no fever tho so we dont think it was COVID.  Anyway, our cat that we have had for about 8 years (whim I had never heard cough before) also had a pretty mild cough that came in bouts... Like 5-10 little kitty coughs in a minute, once every other hour or so.  Like us it was mild, so we let it run its course - it only lasted like 7-10 days - about as long as our colds.[deleted]Dogs too. \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/second-dog-in-hong-kong-tests-positive-for-covid-19-virusLame that dogs and cats can get it. Mosquitos should be able to get it and all die off.[removed]Serious question? How worried should we be about mutations as this thing jumps in and out of cats and other domestic creatures? \n\nLots of peeps have those pot bellied pigs and birds and bats and all sorts of creatures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the movie contagion - at the very end, you see the producers vision for how the pandemic in the movie started and it was a bat flying into the rafters that dropped what looked like a bit of banana down to the floor and a pig picks it up and scarfs it down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen here comes the guy that buys the pig and sells it to a chef who preps the pig and then gets called out to meet a diner (patient # 1 ) shake hands and take a picture - and we're off to the races.Do they show symptoms? One of our cats started sneezing a couple of weeks ago and was generally fatigued but is okay now. We joked it was COVID-19. She is an indoor cat though... probably just a coincidence?Is there a link to the original paper?Seriously, we are still at the stage were we are still pondering whether a virus that's easy to spread and come in contact with and has already been proven to jump species in mammals can affect domestic pets? **Cattle can be affected by Covid-19.** We need to get prepared for that inevitability immediately, unless you just don't care about an entire food chain being used as the mutation pool for the next iteration of the coronavirus.The article isn\u2019t answering the one question I have, is it dangerous for cats? Like, does it have the same fatality risk in animals as it does in humans? Sorry if that\u2019s a dumb question, I\u2019m just very concerned for my fur baby.Ok, now the way things are going, even if this turns in to a cat pandemic, whatever you do, don't get some sort of ape as a pet. Also if you do, somehow, end up with a chimpanzee, don't teach it to read, or name it Caesar.We need to cure this. NOWWould this make cats a good preclinical model?If your cat lives indoors then it has been practicing social distancing.\n\nIf it doesn't live indoors, now is the time to start.\n\nAn indoor cat can't possibly catch the virus except from the humans it lives with so worry about those damn humans first.All the Karens in the world: This is it...we need to see the manager of this virus!More importantly, I would like to know does that mean they can spread it(to humans and cats)? and if cats other mammals or animals?So can a cat then transmit it back to a human?If it\u2019s anything like other coronaviruses in cats, it can also cause weird complications like balls swelling\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11222021[removed]Do cats progress faster than humans woth covid19? Could they potentially be covid sniffing cats? Except no sniffing, and they sadly die sometimes?[removed]The tiger at the Bronx Zoo, so I guess this makes sense.My cat has asthma. She\u2019s only 4, but still. This scares me. :(Great...ugh my kitty is sleeping next to me right now. I hope we both stay healthy.So if my cat have been sneezing since 2 days should I been concerned?I read there was a confirmed case in a cat weeks ago. Why is it now saying maybe?Yes I would think if a tiger can get so can a house cat.My cat is 17. I'm pretty sure we've shared colds before. I'm going to have to be extra careful to not get sick with covid-19.I thought as much after news of a tiger getting infected came out. So if this thing possibly travels via fecal matter, then could people catch it from their cats when changing their litter boxes?Haven\u2019t we known that cats and dogs are susceptible since like mid-late February? \n\nWhy is this news?So if I get sick, my kitty can't care for me.As someone living in nyc with a cat that has asthma, just add this to a list of things to have extreme and unyielding anxiety about.Everyone is worried about if their pets will die. The more important question is: will them having it increase viral titer in their human owners? If so, those owners will have a lot more to worry about than their cat\u2019s health.So now I have to be afraid for myself, my family members, AND my little guys. Great. Greeeeeeeeeeeeat.It's almost like i knew this over a month ago based on first hand accounts. Did anybody take that info seriously? Of course not.I\u2019m wondering if this might be what my senior kitty died of earlier this week. I\u2019ve been there for 6 of my pets in their final days... this was without a question the worst experience of all of them. I feel so awful. I\u2019m so afraid my other cat and dog may now get it. I feel like I failed her completely.I wonder how animal shelters are handling this, having so many cats in close quarters and in varying degrees of health. I hope staff are doing their best to keep their animals safe.Welp I\u2019m screwed I have 7 and they\u2019re oldBlack Panther guy is gonna have a bad time.I don't know how I'm going to get a mask on my cat Spud.I work for a cat sanctuary. This is particularly concerning.. a lot of the cats in our care are pretty old (10+ years old)So does that explain the tiger in the zoo testing positive?I am fairly certain that my 9yr old cat has it... She has been seriously ill the last 8/10 days or so... Almost stopped eating, lost a ton of weight, hiding away from activity and noise and shying away from being touched/stroked...\n\nNow that I'm stroking her really gently, she is coming for attention again and she is responding to tuna, and wet food (rather than her normal dry food)Imagine if this spread to birds.  No containing that.Wasnt this a Simpson's episode?Damn, my cat is 20 years old. This is just one more thing to worry about...actually if I'm being honest this is going to worry me more than anything else going on right now.what about black cats?Funny how any species are capable to test positive. Just as aids.Actually, releasing \"news\" like this one on the wild(ex:facebook) might be more dangerous for domestic cats than covid-19. People will be afraid of their own pet and abandon them.I feel like we've known about this since Feburary.>An experiment in a lab \u2014 like injecting a big dose of the virus through a cat\u2019s nose \u2014 \u201cdoes not replicate what is happening in people\u2019s homes around the world,\" Calle points out.\n\nI feel bothered that this isn't focused on more. Yes, they are able to replicate the disease in their respiratory system but based on the studies Ive read it seems that there isn't a need to worry as the lab tests do not replicate real world circumstances. Can anyone speak to this point?My cat got sick randomly a couple days ago, he was breathing badly and doing the death rattle noise. He was 9 and had urinary problems which costed 3 grand to fix 1.5 years ago and the family decided we couldnt pay to treat it this time. He had a good life. We took him to the vet to be euthanized (hard decision but he was in pain, couldnt move) but died in the car on the way there. This was just yesterday. \n\n:,( we joked it was corona, but none of us have it.. still it is suspicious.  RIP Tigger AKA Mr. Wiggy Aka Fat kitty we love you.Well, Fluffy, your time has come. I shall miss you.Those bastards. Now they took it too far.Did they just realize this after the tiger tested positive for Coronavirus or.......?Bad news for redditors.Does anyone know what the symptoms would be? My cat has been sneezing a lot recently and she\u2019s 15 years old. She seems perfectly fine otherwise so I figured maybe it was just a change in weather. But now I\u2019m wondering if I should be concerned.I dont care about humans (bigassasteroid2020) but touching cats is over the line.Luka Magnotta just moves to the edge of his seatSo you're telling me there's a way I can get a puppy after all...\n\nKidding!  Kidding.  Mostly.Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then\u2026 Sprinkles! God, that\u2019s 3 things.Now we will all get to see how utterly selfish and hypocritical  these pet parents and selective animal lovers ( cats and dogs only) are.My group-of-risk father would not let his cat to sleep with him anymore because he says the pet could transmit the virus to him. I laughed and explained to him that wasn't possible but he argued back. He also has very suspicious \"theories\" and mantras like putting onions everywhere in the house or a white tie at the door, or to drink hot drinks in the morning to protect him from coronavirus. I can't believe he actually knew something before me (or science).That's really scary and depressing newsI don't understand how cats couldn't retransmit to humans it's not as if cats can sneeze on us or lick us. So what's going on here?A few weeks ago one my cats was having sneezing and coughing fits. I couldn\u2019t get him into the vet until the following week. During this same time, I was also having a sore throat, slight dry cough and a heavy chest. By the time Of his appointment, his brothers were also coughing and sneezing and one of them developed diarrhea so I ended up taking the sicker one to the vet because the cat that was sick first was doing better. The vet said he had an upper respiratory infection. It\u2019s been another 6 days.  The cats and I are all starting to feel better. \n\nWas it all coincidence or was it COVID-19?\n\nEdited to add: My cats that were/are sick are 10 months old.Why I had been saying, I'm worried about 24 year old cat for if anyone in my house gets it, especially me because she cuddles up to me and god does she yell if she can't.\n\nAll my cats are velcros thoughAny virus can jump from humans to cats/dogs/reptiles easily. My father gave our Schnauzer viral pneumonia when he was sick 32 years ago when I was only 7 years old.\n\nHe felt terrible about that but some of the blame had to be put on Twikie, he just would not stay down from dad's bed while Dad was sick until he got sick. Luckily Twikie made a full recovery but that showed that dogs and cats can get human diseases.Clarification from the BVA: https://www.bva.co.uk/news-and-blog/news-article/bva-statement-on-cats-and-covid-19/\n\nUpdate on that clarification:\nhttps://www.bva.co.uk/news-and-blog/news-article/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-updates-for-the-veterinary-profession/My cat had iodine treatment for her hypothyroidism, so we're not supposed to have more than an hour of close contact with her for a couple of weeks.\n\nShe does not approve of this policy. She's upset every time she gets taken off a lap or the bed, which is often right now.\n\nIt would be so hard to do distancing with her like they suggest. I guess we'd have to lock her in a room or something; there's no keeping her off of a lap or a warm sleeping body that she has access to. She would end up really depressed, I think. Yet another reason to hope that nobody in our house gets sick.NOOOOOOOOO!!    \n   \nNow I have an actual stake in this epidemic. Leave my cat out of this, you monsters!Cats are genetically not very far away from pangolins so this is expected. But this proves only the ability of the virus to replicate in a cat. It did not show a realistic way of infectionThis is either the death of us or we have nothing to worry aboutI've said this all along. Why am I not on the task force?So, do I stop letting the cat go out or what?My cats are getting pretty old. They are pretty fat as well. Double pneumonia is a good way to die I hear.Great... both me and my cat have asthma. We better not get it and give it to each otherThe internet is in danger...Anything with ace2 receptors is theoretically vulnerableI had to put my cat down today! She was fine last night. A healthy fat cat. Out of know where she just started panting. This morning she could barley breath. By 10 am we had to put her down. She\u2019s never had any issues. The vet had no clue as to what happened. I wonder if it wasn\u2019t covid19??So basically everyone and every mammal is potentially at riskJo matter the species, the old bastards are always the first to get fuckedAnecdotal, but I\u2019m currently in my FIL\u2019s house, and they feed a bunch of strays. Starting a couple of weeks ago, 3-4 of the cats have been having some sort of a cold. Their eyes are watery. Yesterday, the weakest kitten with that cold died. Since this happened right after I read the news about the tiger, I suspected that they may have the virus. Now this news is scary. Thankfully none of us have the virus, but it\u2019s interesting and chilling to see this virus spread even to animals.In Texas I have to be HUGE!!![deleted]This makes me more nervous then getting it myself.My baby franklin is 21 and we live in north jersey ... guess my cat buddy\u2019s stuck inside now\ud83d\ude15-sigh- here we go again..This is the worst news in the history of the worldThis is in vitro and I doubt the need to have studied this in lieu of a real world case. \n\nI'm worried This is going to cause cats to suffer.Is it common for viruses to jump species? I thought it was rare. For it to go from pangolin or bat to human to cat seems crazy to me - but then again, I know very little about this shiz.Alright Mr. Covid >:c YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR!interesting that pigs can't get it, aren't they often used as model organisms for vaccines?Hey there, all you covid cats and kittens[removed]One of my cats has the wonderful habit of stuffing as much of her face into people's mouths as possible if they open their mouths near her. She's woken me up before by doing that when I'm sleeping.It was stated in the article I read that the Tigers' care taker was a confirmed positive prior to the the cats being tested.[removed]Hi -- apologies to everyone if I just need more sleep, but the Inverse article (not the study) describes \"older\" \"senior\" cats being more susceptible \n\nHowever the actual Science study only has two age groupings: \n\njuvenile cats (aged 70\u2013100 days) \nsubadult cats (aged 6-9 months) \n\nAm I missing something...? \n\nThx :-)[removed][removed]It would be interesting to see if cats who already have feline coronavirus (asymptomatic), recovered from FIP (via GS1447) or received the Felocell (FIP) vaccine show cross immunity for covid 19.Would you happen to have any insight on whether pet rabbits could be susceptible to covid-19? \n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, one of my rabbits suddenly developed a cough and trouble breathing and she died before I could get her to vet. Granted, she was 11 years old but she seemed very healthy until the day before she passed, still circling my feet begging for treats. She started out lethargic, poor appetite and then a cough to gasping breaths within 36 hours. \n\nI had been sick with a fever in the week prior to her death and between hearing that some people get very few covid-19 symptoms and now hearing that other animals are testing positive, it's made me wonder. I have 3 other bunnies so if I didn't have the rona yet, I'm still curious to know if I need to worry about them potentially getting it from me if I do catch it.Could you shed some light on the mechanism that would allow a cat to transmit COVID-19 to other cats, but not to humans?\n\nMy naive understanding is that if the virus is replicating and being expelled by coughing the species of the critter shouldn\u2019t matter. Is it likely that COVID-19 replicating in a feline would be making copies of itself that could not infect humans?> Fun!\n\nWe\u2019ll have to agree to disagree on that one.How would cats not be able to transmit it? Are they only vulnerable to a different reassortant strain? Or the same strain that's infecting humans?\n\nIf they're vulnerable to the same strain infecting humans, I don't see how they wouldn't shed the virus in the same way.[removed]Do  you have anything that points to how it is not able or why it is not able to go from cats back to humans?  I just do not see why that would be.  I thought I read feline's respiratory system is  a lot like humans and is why this covid is able to jump to them.  If that is the case, WHEN or HOW is it not possible to come back out and infect another human?  Just because it doesn't make sense to me though means nothing I am no expert at any of this that is for sure.  \n\nIf you can find something that explains why THIS COVID from human to cat is not able to go back to human I would love to read it.I do hope that they can't transmite it to humans, else I fear a lot of cats will soon be abandoned or worse :((I'm totally convinced I caught a \"cold\" from a cat when I visited the pound some months ago. Cat sneezed, I felt particle on my lip... Was sick the next day... Had it for a couple weeks, like a respiratory infection... Chesty,  with congestion...  I joke that that was my 'inoculation' for covid, though I know it doesn't work that way... I also saw an article a couple weeks that suggested dogs could carry it.I imagine many species are at risk. I have a great concern about people whom are venturing out into remote areas of the wilderness potentially spreading this to local wildlife. \n\nI read the article about the tiger in NY and it seemed to confirm my suspicions about reverse zoonosis being possible regarding Covid.\n\nI fear that many monkeys, apes and many other species are at risk also.  Most of our publicized concerns have been human-centric when this pandemic could have a significant impact on conservation efforts and lead to already struggling forms of life to be effectively wiped out.\n\nThis is just an opinion and I have no qualifications.Really fucked that they\u2019re forcing those animals to become sick in the name of science[removed]>Some of the juvenile cats developed \u201cmassive lesions\u201d in the nose, trachea, and lungs. So actually, the younger cats were worse off.\n\nI\u2019m not finding the specifics in the summary of the research article, but the last few paragraphs of OP\u2019s article seem to indicate this reaction wasn\u2019t present in domestic cats - but rather larger cat species.Uhhhhh, \u201cmassive lesions\u201d in the nose, trachea, and lungs sure fuckin seem like symptoms to me.You should what actions people need to take: Keep your cat indoors, do not dump them at a shelter. If you're quarantined, your cat should be too.Is this the Chinese study? Last I read, older cats are \"worse off\" because they killed and dissected all the younger cats. Only the older cats were kept to test the effects on the virus on them.[deleted]> Several other tigers and lions have also exhibited symptoms of Covid-19...\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/nyregion/bronx-zoo-tiger-coronavirus.html\n\nI wondered if this meant all cats were vulnerable or just big cats.Also one of the British expats who lived in Wuhan who contracted but survived the virus in January documented how his cat came down with similar symptoms and died during his worst part of his illness.How did they test that tiger?[removed]Heck I didn't need a scientific study, as soon as that tiger was confirmedYes, but how many are infected? I would wager a low amount.How does a tiger in the zoo get it? It's not like they're in close contact with people. Even trainers aren't going to get in their face.Same with an household cat in Belgium.\n\n\nhttps://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/103003/coronavirus-belgian-woman-infected-her-cat/A housecat somewhere in southern Belgium was also tested positive for the virus [on March 27](https://www.knmvd.nl/besmette-covid-19-kat-in-belgie/), we've known this for a while.In addition to what /u/arghyematey said, the vet might be willing / able to contact the local (human) health department or other relevant authority to arrange a test, if the cat has been in contact with your cousin in the right time period.\"Neither Nadia nor the domestic cats studied \u201cactually ever acted terribly sick,\u201d Bronx Zoo veterinarian Paul Calle told the\u00a0Times.\"\n\nFrom the article.

If it affects them at all, it would look like a very minor illness. This particular coronavirus seems to be able to thrive in a bunch of different animals but only has severe consequences in humans.I'm not sure anything has been confirmed. They really only just confirmed they can get it, and probably don't know much about it's specific pathology in cats.From the research papers, it's not likely. Very old cats could be pushed over the edge but it's not likely to kill your cats. Also there would have been reports of cats dying already given the 1 million global cases we have. \n\nThe big problem is there are fucktonne of stray cats and house cats that are allowed to wander around outside, murdering billions of animals for fun btw, and those cats could  transfer the virus between isolated people.Yes. From the article published in Science, they seem to side step the fact that one of the juvenile cats died within 3 days after viral inoculation... This is a worrying paper that's poorly reported and crossed ethical boundaries. I'm really surprised they published this in such a high impact journal such as Science.Don\u2019t worry - from the bottom of the article:\n\n> Neither Nadia nor the domestic cats studied \u201cactually ever acted terribly sick,\u201d Bronx Zoo veterinarian Paul Calle told the Times.\n\n>An experiment in a lab \u2014 like injecting a big dose of the virus through a cat\u2019s nose \u2014 \u201cdoes not replicate what is happening in people\u2019s homes around the world,\" Calle points out.\n\n>In fact, cats may not be \u201cgenerally susceptible\u201d to getting sick from the novel coronavirus, he says.

I think I would still be devastated though because if she dies of the virus it means I probably gave it to her.[deleted]Yep, my cats aren't that old, but I feel the same way.  Honestly, the only reason I don't want to get it myself is out of fear that I wouldn't be able to keep taking care of them.  Now I get to add to that the fear that I'll pass it on to them.  If my cats died, there'd also be literally no more reason for me to stick around, either.My cat is only 16, so he'll be fine.Yeah mine has feline asthma too, 17 years old, no way he would surivive itI feel the exact same way and my cat is only 5. Prayers.Thanks for this. My cat has recently been sneezing a lot and I figured it was allergies because of the weather change. But seeing this freaked me out a bit.[removed]Exactly.

Sadly however, we can pass it on to them. And this breaks my heart.He probably just has herpes virus with an associated URI, most - almost all - cats have it.My cat has also been sneezing the past few days... Hasn\u2019t had any discharge out of his eyes or nose though so I take that as a good sign. But I\u2019m still worried \ud83d\ude1eMy cat has been sneezing for the past 5 years. I ended up taking her to a specialty internal medicine vet who did an endoscopy of her sinuses. Turns out she has a chronic condition where she has permanent sinus inflammation. \n\nI would feel really bad if I got the Rona and gave it to her on top of it.My FeLV positive cat have the sniffles atm. He seems well enough so hopefully not that as it can be deadly in his case.\n\nHe also sneezed squarely on my face yesterday so if he\u2019s positive, we\u2019ll see about that transmission.Same exact thing with all of mine :(Could be a lot of stuff. If it continues, take him to the vet, better safe than sorry.[deleted]My just about 2 year old cat just got over a cold. Made me worried he had it. Either way he is a lot better now, so even if he did have it, he is better hopefully. But now I'm worried about it being me who gave it to him since he is an indoor cat.>Neither Nadia nor the domestic cats studied \u201cactually ever acted terribly sick,\u201d Bronx Zoo veterinarian Paul Calle told the Times.\n\n>An experiment in a lab \u2014 like injecting a big dose of the virus through a cat\u2019s nose \u2014 \u201cdoes not replicate what is happening in people\u2019s homes around the world,\" Calle points out.\n\n>In fact, cats may not be \u201cgenerally susceptible\u201d to getting sick from the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt sounds like your cat should be fine. :) Stay safe though!There are always a few idiots but most people\u2019s cats live inside or don\u2019t interact with people outside of the family so even if it is possible to catch the virus from a cat (so far we only know we can give it to cats) it\u2019s a low risk. We put ourselves (and anyone we live with) at greater risk every time we leave the house.This is already happening in the Middle East, people were killing or dumping pets (not just cats but dogs too) due to rumors of them transmitting the virus. Sometimes killing them in really cruel ways. There needs to be good information on this that gives clear guidelines of whether the pet can transmit it (getting the virus is not the same as transmitting) or how to limit transmission risks without drastic measures like killing the animal.Either that or he meant he was awaiting corona test results, as many physicians are...Exactly. There are more than a million cases in humans and five in animals so far(all of which recovered). The two dogs that tested positive each had other dogs in the home with them who tested negative. \n\nThe cat in Belgium, there\u2019s some discrepancy as to how his testing samples were collected. The pre-print study about cats is highly inconclusive and as you mentioned, the way they exposed the cats to covid was not at all realistic.> I don\u2019t really buy into this. If it were the case hundreds, if not thousands, of cats would be infected worldwide by now.\n\nHow would we know there isn't? We're not testing cats. We can't even test enough humans.Yea it's not common. Cats can get several upper respiratory bugs from humans as can ferrets, it's rarely an issue but possible.Yeah this is just anxiety news. Get people whipped up about their cats. \n\n'Cats are not completely unaffected' gets turned into \"cats can get coronavirus!!!!!!' \n\nNo one talks about how much virus they find, just that its found.This is so true. When my dog get sick, there is a diagnosis, plan and medication. \n\nMy cat got sick last year? Diagnosis - Fever of Unknown Origin. He ran a fever for a week. No one knows why and he just magically recovered. It\u2019s like they haven\u2019t spent half the time on figuring out cats.Depends how you look at it\n\nCats usually live a lot longer so that is one thingNot lysol.The three household products you can use are bleach, isopropyl alcohol 70%, and hydrogen peroxide 3%\n\nSee here for a list published by the Advisory Board on Cat Diseases:\nhttp://www.abcdcatsvets.org/disinfectants/#chemical-disinfectants-for-use-in-veterinary-practices\n\nAt my animal hospital, we use a veterinary disinfectant called \"Rescue\". It comes in Wipes/Liquid form and contains \"accelerated hydrogen peroxide\", or hydrogen peroxide with added surfactants, detergents, and chelating agents.Regular detergents and soaps deactivate the virus.  A steamer/steam-mop will also make short work of contaminated surfaces (though wearing a mask while using one is recommended).>lost 10 or more pounds,\n\nThe average weight of a cat is 7.9 \u2013 9.9 lbs  10 pounds of weight loss, no matter how big the cat is, is a huge deal.\n\n>We did not tie this together and were babying him during that time.\n\nI get the whole quarantine thing but three weeks ago we were not in the same place as we are now, what made you decide not to visit the vet?People that know more than me have said elsewhere in this thread that prevailing science suggests it can\u2019t be transmitted from cats to humans- just the other way around. \n\nStill not what I would consider hard dataSounds like you had a pretty fat cat, weight loss and general unwellness could be explained by diabetes.>next week and half, he barely ate or drank, lost 10 or more pounds, hip bones pointing out, couldn\u2019t meow, had difficulty swallowing.\n\nWhat did the vet say??\n\nP.S. I wouldn't start trying to diagnose your cat with COVID-19Did you take your cat to the vet?Much more likely that you will catch it and infect your cat.Technically YOU carry it.\n\nThey get it from us, as a carrier, not just on their own.The article linked by this post and the study that article discusses found that sars-cov-2 does not replicate well in dogs. Not that it's not impossible- but cats can actually display symptoms/get ill whereas these dogs haven't.I\u2019m pretty sure no dogs have showed any symptoms, nor signs of spreading the virus though. Cats can get symptoms from it, but they can\u2019t spread it.[deleted]I\u2019m fairly certain my dog has it right now. We\u2019ve all had COVID-19 for the past month and haven\u2019t left the house in 5 weeks. People have been dropping necessities to our porch. Our dog just displayed symptoms two days ago. First day: fever, lethargic. Second day: won\u2019t eat or drink. Today: conjunctivitis, lethargic, won\u2019t eat or drink, fast breathing and runny nose. Strangely enough, all the same symptoms my daughters had. My symptoms were completely different. She\u2019s young and healthy, I\u2019m really hoping she pulls through. The rest of the family had it 5-14 days. I\u2019m still symptomatic 4 weeks later.> How worried should we be about mutations as this thing jumps in and out of cats and other domestic creatures?\n\nlook up \"Hendra\" it is a virus that infects bats. it can infect horses if it comes in contact with amniotic fluid of an infected bat. once the horse has it, it can infect humans. so a horse acts as an amplifier, to either help mutate the virus or allow it to grow to a large enough volume where it is infectious to humans. \n\n>Selvey tapped into the wildlife-carer networks in southeastern Australia, eventually finding 128 bat carers willing or eager to be tested. She and her field team drew the blood and asked each participant to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaires revealed that many of these people had had prolonged and close contact with flying foxes\u2014feeding them, handling them, not infrequently getting scratched or nipped. One carer had been bitten deeply on the hand by a Hendra-positive bat. The most unexpected finding of Selvey\u2019s survey was the percentage of those 128 carers who tested positive for antibodies: zero. Despite months and years of nurturing, despite scratches and bites and cuddling and drool and blood, not one person showed immunological evidence of having been infected with Hendra virus. [Spillover by David Quammen]\n\nso an animal may be infected but not be able to transmit the infection to humans. unless an amplifier host is introduced, that is.The question is serious, sure but using a movie as a base is not.\n\nThat said, it's a respiratory virus, like the flu, just much worse for some people. If this were a major concern (the species to species mutations) our particular species would have been already eradicated a dozen times over in the last few centuries.[removed][removed]Cats tend to carry colds for life. They just go into remission. My kitten has been dealing with Feline calicivirus. It cause him to get boogers, sneeze and his nose will weeze. If you have a vet you can get Viralys to mix into there food and it helps their immune system to fight it back into remission.They say the average person will swallow about 20 spiders while sleeping over the course of their lifetime. It never occurred to me that the number of cats swallowed might be greater than zero.I didn't see that, thanks![removed][removed]It seems that they do not mean \"older\" as in \"elderly\", they simply mean \"the older group of the 2 tested\", or simply took this information and assumed it would continue to be worse as age increased.[removed][removed]Same. I want more information on the danger risks to the cats themselves.My cat typically sleeps in our bedroom during day to relax away from the kids noise. Well for over the last week my wife has been isolated there cause she has virus. So far our cat seems fine, no symptoms and acting like usual. She is young, under 2 yrs old. So hopefully she stays well, my fluff.Yup me too. My kitty is FIV+ and has always been susceptible to upper respiratory infections. At least we live somewhere fairly isolated, just the cat and I,  and I\u2019ve been isolating at home, with a trip for groceries every 10 days, for the last month.Same here. I have two almost 10 year old cats. One is basically a potato and one is like an old dojo master from an anime. I'd be sick with worry if they got sickUgh same, my 11 year old cat was diagnosed with congestive heart failure last year. I am so scared for him :(Same, my cat had two surgeries late last year for a severe sinus infection and is still recovering, he's 10 and has early kidney disease, I don't want to get him sickSame. Both of my cats are old and have health problems.Wait, there's an FIP vaccine now? I only knew about treatment.I\u2019m sorry for your loss. 11 years is amazing for a bunny! Hope your buddies are ok.From what I've read that's pretty typical for Rabbits though? They hide their illness very well and are quite prone to uri? There's also a mosquito spread disease that is causing trouble for them as I'm sure you're aware. Sorry to hear about your bun.Oh wow. That\u2019s very interesting. \n\nI did a quick search and looks looks there\u2019s indeed a [variety of Corona virus in rabbits.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2829566/)11 years old! RIP madam bunny. i am so sorry your  bunny left this world. i hope you are feeling a little better now. \ud83d\ude22Same thing with my beloved cat :(  and she was active as all hell. Not the type to just lay around. Couldn't afford to have the vet continue to take fluid from her lungs every 3ish days. really, really sucks...A few months ago, before covid-19 was here, we had an 11yo rabbit suddenly gasping for air (open mouth breathing and all), apparently caused by a lot of snot. Within half an hour of us finding out, the rabbit lost consiousness and within minutes died. Because this was also an up to then very healthily looking rabbit, we had a necropsy done by the vet. It turned out to be a myocardial infarction. A heart attack. Which I guess is not that much of a surpise for an 11yo rabbit.\n\nI'd say keep a close eye on your other rabbits (you probably do anyway, since your rabbit made it to 11) and if one develops similar symptoms, take it to the vet immediately. Also, should one more die, have a necropsy done, just so you'll know more. The one at our vet (Netherlands) didn't even cost us anything.Depending where you are - myxomatosis or rabbit hemorrhagic disease might be more likely (if it was a disease and not old age combined with maybe something a younger healthier rabbit could rebound from.)\n\nThere's also a huge laundry list of other potential things that are also much more likely such as stasis. \n\nYou're best bet is probably to call your vet and describe the symptoms to them. I'd say a necropsy if possible but since you are sick I wouldn't leave the house for the safety of others - and for the safety of yourself, if it's not Corona but you're sick and leave and catch Corona then you're worse off than a healthy person who would already be pretty poorly prepared. \n\nI am sorry for your loss. I hope your health improves soon too!Not sure on that in a general sense, I agree it seems weird, but more practically it wouldn\u2019t seem to be a concern. If your cat gets it, it\u2019s almost certainly getting it from you or someone else in your house, right? So you don\u2019t need to worry about getting it from your cat cause you already have it.\n\nEdit: ok, apparently it\u2019s a big concern! Apologies.Viruses like this can use coreceptors from your own cells - they basically coat themselves in a bit of your cell's plasma membrane which contains many if your own proteins. It may be that there are important human proteins that allow for entry of the virus into cat cells, but the cat proteins don't allow efficient entry into human cellsMy sentiment exactly, it might be fun for researchers but as owner of multiple cats this is far from fun.Good question! It all has to do with how this particular bug transmits. In this case, this is a respiratory virus that (from what we know now and can assume form similar Coronaviruses) is transmitted through droplets, and less likely aerosols. So, we need a droplet form an infected individual to come in contact with a mucous membrane (eyes, nose, throat what ever). Cats are unlikely to cough any significant amount for it to matter. Is the virus in saliva like rabies? We don't know, and I find that unlikely. We also have to take into account the different pathoegnesis and virulence in another species. You're assuming it causes the exact same disease and pathology - it likely does not. Other examples of this - guinea pigs are highly susceptible to TB, but rarely, if ever, transmit it even when we force them to form cavitary disease. Marmoset also do not transmit TB to one another, because they just don't cough (from my experience working with marms and TB). \n\nIn addition, since this is a 'reverse zoonosis', if we transmit it to cats, we will have protective antibodies, and reinfection is unlikely. This is also a topic of debate, though.Even though they could catch it from us, the virus has to mutate or evolve to be able to spread within their own species.\n\nEdit:  Not specifically about this coronavirus, but,\n\n\u201cTo infect a new host, a virus must be able to efficiently infect the appropriate cells of the new host, and that process can be restricted at many different levels, including receptor binding, entry or fusion, trafficking within the cell, genome replication, and gene expression. The production and shedding of infectious virus may also be host specific. Multiple host barriers to infection would each require one or more corresponding changes in the virus, making the host range barrier increasingly difficult to cross.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546865/Maybe it can't replicate as much? Their normal body temperature is 3 degrees hotter than humansThey get it from us, it seems.\n\nEven more reason to stay home!Covid-catastrophe, surely?Yeah did I understand this correctly? They just took some cats and gave them COVID?Technically no. They are signs. Symptoms would be cough, sneezes etc. For clarification, signs are what the doctor/examiners find. Symptoms are what the patient experiences.We need to be extremely careful how this topic is shared with the public, because it can cause spikes in abandonment. [It's happening in Lebanon right now.](https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/covid-19-lebanese-abandon-pets-after-coronavirus-rumours-1.70815580) A premature and irresponsible news report said dogs and cats can spread the virus, causing a spike in abandoned pets that are being poisoned in the streets.Wasn\u2019t there a house cat in Belgium that got it?[removed]That's so heartbreaking. I really hope my girlfriend doesn't get it working pharmacy. She wouldn't be able to live with herself if she got her cats killed.It had to be sedated in order to collect a sample. Only one of the sick animals was tested despite more than one animal showing signs of respiratory disease. This is likely due to the staff/time/equipment needed and the inherent risks of sedating/anesthetizing them.[removed][removed]It was sedated first and it's not the same test humans get.Very carefullyThey asked *very* nicely.Carefully.[removed]Food preparation possibly, or from an enrichment item. A keeper was asymptomatic early on. Keepers there are in rotating teams right now so that exposed teams can be pulled without loss of animal care.The problem with cats is they either look like they're fine and are keeping up apperances. Or they're extremely sick to the point that they can't fake being well.Thank you !There was a preprint going around earlier that showed it was quite fatal for kittens but none of the 8+ month cats died in that Chinese study.For more about Nadia and the other big cats, go to the 48:40 minute mark in this Zoom presentation to hear about her case right from chief vet Dr. Calle! \nhttps://zoom.us/rec/share/2vdPBaz363lJT7fpuV37a4Q5ENrsX6a81SIX86IIz04gjSaV368PgxgQ67J0xhJuThank goodness!Thank you !I wish there was a greater emphasis on the fact that cats can not spread this to humans. I'm very worried about an increase in pet abandonment should this study get passed around social media too much*burying the lede*I know ! That's the most important part in my opinion.Then no one would read it. They know what they're doing. If it bleeds it leads.Same. I have 3 seniors, one is FIV+ with rhinitis.

Mine are indoor only and I think they all should be, too. Ah, that is a problem. Poor kitties always get a bad rap![deleted]My concern about this is a group of idiots going around killing cats because they think they'll get sick from being around them.\n\nThere are a lot of outdoor cats in my neighborhood. Many don't have collars anymore because they're chipped. Those of us who are friendly to cats know them all, but someone who doesn't like cats isn't going to check or probably even care.Same, my cat is 16. She's still healthy but I'm extra nervous for herJust keep showing your love to him like nothing is wrong, he's a good kitteh.I am about where you are. My little guy is 15, was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer last October after an xray for his heart murmur. By advanced I mean basically his entire chest cavity is the tumor. The vet couldn't believe he was still acting normally, he thinks the tumor grew so slow his body has learned to compensate.\n\nWe didn't think he would make it to the new year. Thankfully he is more or less fine, zero issues other than occasional constipation due to unrelated decreased kidney function. But I, like you, are scared because I know there is zero chance of him surviving should he get it.Cats are notorious for hiding their sickness thoughIt\u2019s still COVID research that can contribute to our overall understanding, it\u2019s not like cat researchers are able to help with the human research.I get what you\u2019re saying. I just feel like if it was a huge risk or something dangerous for cats, you would be hearing a lot of reports from cat owners.[deleted]I don\u2019t believe there have been any confirmed cases yet for dogs.That chunk isn't even from the study, it's just comments from the zoo vetAll the same...I worry about the effects of a study being passed around social media where it doesn't make it very clear up front that house cats aren't likely to get sick or transmit to humans. That kind of panic is what causes spikes in pet abandonment.\n\n[There dogs and cats being abandoned](https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/covid-19-lebanese-abandon-pets-after-coronavirus-rumours-1.70815580) and poisoned in the streets right now in Lebanon because of an irresponsible announcement that they could spread the virus.Thanks for this - not sure what to believe now.  My cat has been lying by my side for 3 weeks while I've been struggling through this.  If I lose him to this virus I will be beside myself.\n\nBut hearing that it doesn't actually make them sick is a relief.  But now I'm scared to be near him.[removed]That's not proven in anyway and is likely not true. If the virus can replicate in them, which it can, and you have intimate contact, especially repeated contact it could transfer it.Get a tub of Viralis Lysine powder and put a little scoop in their food.My cat gets like that with pollen and stuff around the allergy seasons. I\u2019m sure your cat is fine and it\u2019s probably something like this. \n\nIt\u2019s been very rainy in my area and cold/hot so lots of mold and sudden pollen spikes in the area.I just wanna say bravo for that level of vet care.My cat started sneezing constantly last fall. We brought her to the vet where they took xrays and didn\u2019t see anything then all kinds of antibiotics that don\u2019t seem to help. \nThey want 2000 dollars for the endoscopy. I\u2019m at over 500 with all of the above and don\u2019t know when the heck I get to go back to work. It\u2019s beyond my means to help her. \nIt breaks my heart watching her wheeze like that.I am significantly bummed out by thisWe would be hearing about all the people with elderly cats saying that there cats are dying, the article seems to say that humans can pass COVID-19 to cats.I'm happy your cat got better though (:Yeah that's true, come to think of it I dont think I've ever heard of a dog living to 30, many cats have though.Why not?[deleted]My first guess is that the ten pounds thing is an estimate, and a bad one. \"Ten or more\" really points to that.Other stuff is saying that dogs don't get it and have no symptoms. I'd make sure it's not something more serious that affects dogs. Maybe call a vet?Agreed, I\u2019m not sure dogs can\u2019t get it.  Recently saw minor coughing in two of mine, which from my rescue experience meant kennel cough, but they haven\u2019t been anywhere.  A third lost weight suddenly and was diagnosed with diabetes.  If they could only talk.[removed]A long time ago my first cat was a Figaro, and that was the nickname we gave him, tooBut that's actually not true either. From the actual study: \"These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in cats, **with younger cats being more permissive**...\"\n\nThe inverse article is wrong on this, the younger group was more permissive/susceptible.[removed][removed][removed][removed]Don't let him anymore, make him clean and safe places also from the kids. I hope y'all be healthy![deleted]I think there's been one for a while, because I seem to remember learning about it in school when I was studying to be a vet tech (I'm no longer a practicing vet tech). But I also vaguely recall the teacher saying that it wasn't used often, because it wasn't a particularly good vaccine, so they don't typically recommend it to clients.\n\nMy information could be pretty out of date that this point though. It's been about 7 years since I worked as a VT. I also could be misremembering for the same reason.To date there is still no effective feline coronavirus vaccine that prevents fip.May you always feel your Bun Close \ud83c\udf38 I\u2019m so so sorryThere are seven known coronaviruses that infect humans.\n\nCoronaviruses infect many species of mammals, Maybe even all of them, from mice to whales. However, each coronavirus will have a specific range of mammals that I can infect. This particular coronavirus seems to be really bad at infecting dogs, even though dogs have their own coronaviruses that do infect them.\n\nThe original SARS coronavirus originated in a bat and is thought to have been passed through a civet, which is a feloid related to felids (cats).  So it isn\u2019t terribly surprising that this closely related coronavirus could also infect feloids, which include cats great and small.\n\nSo there is some relevance here. First of all, it means that we probably need to start looking at cats as a reservoir for this virus.  Having an animal reservoir makes it more difficult to get rid of a virus. Imagine if this would get into the feral cat population, a population that does have a fair amount of contact with humans.\n\nIt also means that if cat lovers are in high-risk occupations or or high-risk patients themselves, they may need to quarantine themselves from their feline friends.I'm sorry for your loss. That's almost exactly what happened. Not the open mouth breathing, but she was holding her head up at working her nostrils hard and I could see that her pink nose had turned white, but I didn't get any discharge or snot when I used the suction bulb. She got panicky when I tried to get her into the pet carrier and she just fell over, convulsed a couple times and died. I assumed that her heart gave out under the stress of it all, poor old girl. It's just the timing of it (and all the free time I have right now) that makes me wonder.Thank you for your kind words. This happened about 3 weeks ago and I am feeling better.\n\nI'm in NY and my rabbits are indoor only (I don't have a yard) so there's not much worry about myxo or rhd here, thankfully. Plus she didn't have any nasal or eye discharge, no wet chin, front paws were clean and dry. She was prone to stasis but she was still nibbling food, had gut sounds when I listened and she was interested in her favorite foods but seemed like she couldn't eat more than a couple bites, like maybe she felt full too fast. I'm thinking it may have been something that took up space in her chest cavity like a thymoma or perhaps heart failure. She was a dwarf rabbit, less than 3 lbs, so maybe she didn't have a lot of extra space to start with.\n\nUnfortunately, she died while I was trying to get her into the carrier to go to the emergency vet because it was a Friday after 5pm. She got panicked and I couldn't calm her down, she flopped over, convulsed a couple times and that was it. I had to put her body in the freezer until I could bring her to our regular vet. Too late for necropsy. \n\nThe other rabbits didn't have a lot of contact with her (she hated other bunnies!) and they all seem fine. I made an appt to have them checked out but the vet cancelled all of their appts except for emergency because of the lockdown. \n\nShe was old, she had a great life but the timing of this just makes me wonder, that's all.But it's a concern in terms of cats being a reservoir for the virus. Just because you and your family won't won't get it now because you already have it, doesn't mean that your cat can't give it to someone else. Or maybe you have an indoor outdoor cat that gives it to a feral cat, that then gives it to the rest of its colony. There are people that work with feral colonies through spay and neutor programs, that could then get it.\n\nBasically diseases that are not human exclusive are much more difficult to get rid of entirely because humans interact with animals all the time. That's how humans get Rabies, Ebola, and a whole host of other diseases.\n\nSo it's a good thing that they can't give it back to us (as far as we know so far)It's a bit of a concern to me.. I foster cats/kittens, I just took in 3 three week olds the other day. If they could spread it then anyone working with various cats could be exposing themselves(especially vets/vet nurses!). I'm certainly not planning on stopping and I doubt there's a high risk but I'd definitely like to know for sure.It could increase viral load, that would be a real concern. The amount of viral load a person has, has been an indicator on performance and recovery.I believe it was sarcasm.I think anyone that has ever owned a cat will know quite well that cats prefer to parade their anuses in your face rather than sneeze on you.How serious is it for the cat when they do get it? We haven\u2019t heard about any high increases of deaths in cats and have only just heard about it due to a forced study.Do you think lysine supplementation which is sometimes used in cats to prevent feline herpes outbreaks (essentially upper respiratory infections caused by the herpes virus) might help to stave off infection from Covid-19?Cats groom by licking themselves right? Thought are the virus would be present in pretty reasonable levels in saliva, so the entire cat could be considered a fomite no?My cat has been sneezing a lot the last few days. I\u2019ve been keeping him away from my face just in case. Is that unnecessary? If he sneezes right in my face would that not be a possible mode of transmission? (Not that I think it\u2019s likely he has COVID-19, just as a hypothetical).And then euthanized them to get their organs and test them for presence of the virus. That's how research is done -- with animals.In this context, how would those differentiate? A cat isn't going to describe their symptomsDoes every sign have a symptom to match? I think if I had lesions I'd feel pain as a symptomYes. Tested positive and displayed GI symptoms.[removed]That would be brutal to lose a pet. However social distancing is already the norm when I worked in a pharmacy. I never was close to patients when I was there. Coworkers, yes. \n\nAnd of course, if she gets sick, maybe you should take care of the cat and keep a door closed. Even our feline friends benefit from home isolation.I think they meant more....why? I can't get tested even though my coworker's wife tested positive and I sit 5 feet away from the guy and my wife is immunocompromised, but a goddamn *tiger* got a test?[removed]Already tired of this.Sure, but trained vets know how to look past those signs to see if they are suffering.Yeah my cat was pretending to be fine until she couldn't walk.Very much this. My one cat had stopped eating. I couldn't initially tell because the other cat was eating some of her food (communal food dish). She seemed fine until I noticed she was less active. I thought it was just because it was getting into winter and my other cat was typically less active in winter. Turns out she was developing hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease; fat builds up in the liver until the cat's blood becomes toxic from liver dysfunction).\n\nShe survived, thank goodness, but not without a week at the vet and a month and a half of tube feeding at home.This is too true, I wish they didn't do this. My cat was totally fine until one day he had a brain tumor and just a couple weeks to live.Anecdotally, my cat goes upstairs where it's quiet and lays under the bed when it's ill. I'm not sure if this is the case for other cats, but it would make sense as it's a way to hide for potential dangers.Even elderly ones?Or spraying pets with disinfectant. There are a lot of misinformed and ignorant people who Lysol their poor pets. The smell of disinfectant makes me cough and I\u2019m not even asthmatic. I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like for animals.That does not follow from what you quoted.That \"big dose\" statement actually leads me to a question. If we've got any virologists here, does the strength of the infection relate to the amount of viral cells one is exposed to and/or the method of exposure?\n\nE.G. if there's something airborne and you happen to breathe in a few infected cells, is that better than if you touched a surface with a bunch of them and then your face? If you drank from an infected cup would it be better or worse than breathing it in, or would they all spread similarly until reaching a volume where one's body recognises the threat and reacts?He could definitely be at risk. But if you are isolation then you are already doing everything you can. If you cant fully isolate then maybe consider avoiding handling him much for a while and always wash your hands before.\n\nI hope he is okay through this.Same. I've already been incredibly worried about somehow passing it to my mom, who is immunocompromised. I don't get within a few feet of her and haven't been able to hug her or get close at all, since I'm just trying to be extra cautious. So I mostly spend my time in my room, with my 15 year old cat, who cant stay anywhere else in the house cause there are 3 big dogs that freak her out.... I've noticed lately shes not grooming as much and I might be getting paranoid but it seems like shes losing weight. I've had her for over half my life and if I lost her I honestly dont know how I would be able to handle it. This post has got me spiralling into more anxiety.[deleted]Are they good a hiding being dead?But a vet will know what they are talking aboutI agree it likely isn\u2019t very dangerous or at least not very infectious in cats because there hasn\u2019t been an uptick in reported feline mortality by veterinary agencies (as far as my casual google searching could find). They have had plenty of time to notice such issues and raise the alarm if they were occurring.There has only been one documented case in domestic cats living in a home with a patient.I swear I had it around the the beginning of February to the 14th with the symptoms I had. I had what felt like a regular cold where my throat was hurting and stuff but then it got worse than usual. I had a headache and other usual cold symptoms. At the time it didn\u2019t feel like anything out of the ordinary but then I got a cough that lasted for almost 3 weeks and I never experienced anything like that. \n\nI don\u2019t know for sure but looking back now I think I might have had it. \n\nMy symptoms were before it was a big thing but I know if I had those symptoms now I probably would\u2019ve gotten tested and quarantinedWhat's weird about it?Happy that you've recovered. Anything that you did while sick that seemed to help? In case my family or I get it.\n\nAlso, are there any long term effects of it?How did you get tested in the end if no one was looking at covid? Glad you're ok.How do I get on this list?Think about the numbers for a second- at least 1.5 million human cases across the globe and one confirmed feline case. This virus has been raging for months and we haven't seen a major die-off in the world's cat population. The chances of human-feline transmission are most likely incredibly low.\n\nBest wishes to you and your cat.I feel that. I have two cats myself and while I\u2019m not sick, I would hate to have gotten it unknowingly before quarantine and given it to them. It\u2019s been about a month and they\u2019re still hyperactive assholes so I think they\u2019re fine :)[removed]This. We bought salmon flavored lysine powder for our kitten who was having issues. She responded really well and now her immune system has it under control.He is fully indoors though and has been taking Zyrtec for the past 3-4 weeks for possible allergies as he has been experiencing recurrent ear infections caused by yeast[deleted]It was expensive af but at least I know my cat doesn't have a weird tumor. She still honks out sneezes on the couch sometimes though.Its not deadly in cats like humans.Thanks! Me too. He is the nicest, most loving cat I\u2019ve ever met.Various types of -sol cleaners (Lysol, Pinesol, etc) can contain compounds called phenols, which can be toxic to cats.I doubt they weighed their cat. It was probably just a bad guessYeah that article states kinda the opposite of what the actual study link says when it comes to cats. Sloppy-ass writing. No respectable researcher would call this anything but a small dataset about young cats to begin with.\n\nFWIW those of you, like me, who're coming to terms with the fact that COVID anxiety now extends to our furry old coots too, can take comfort from the fact that there is so far no confirmed sign that the virus *ever* progresses to a serious stage in any cat, young or old. And there is definitely zero research data indicating that the *old* would be more susceptible than younger cats.\n\nOne or two cases were anecdotally suspected in China in the initial outbreak, but involved very old cats who were at death's door with existing conditions anyway, and from what I remember both of them only had virus detected on and near the fur (having lived in homes of infected humans) without the kind of all-body sampling done for this study, so we'll never know whether those animals were actually infected to begin with.\n\nKeep your babies safe and inside, especially if they're immuno-supressed. And if you get sick, keep them distanced in the house. But we don't need to worry otherwise given what's known right now, and this article is irresponsibly written.It's almost like they reported... The inverse of that data.It's almost as if the Inverse article inverted the results.To be fair, a lot of Covid19 studies have low (verified and studied) sample sizes. They will only increase as time goes on.\n\nBut honestly, during a global pandemic do you want some early study results with limited sample sizes, to help disseminate information leads; or very exhaustively done with huge sample sizes...after it's over and no information put out as the pandemic goes on...[removed][removed][removed][removed]Me too. Before we started fostering I saw a very ill flame point at Petco. I complained and nothing happened so I kept going back to check on him. I contacted the \"rescue\" who didn't give a damn so I ended up adopting him. \n\nI reported them to the SPCA but they were already being investigated. They fled the state. Authorities found around 150 corpses and 200 other animals, of which the majority had to be euthanized. \n\nSammy was only with us for about 3 months before FIP took him. My only consolation is that he finally knew love. It's been 5 years and I still cry about it.see my comment below for more info. there is no vaccine but there is treatment out there, though it's fairly expensive (low end is $3000, up to $10000+). i'm currently on day 72 of 84 in treating my cat with great success so far.Our vet doesn't recommend the vaccine because it is only effective pre-exposure to FCoV but most cats get feline coronavirus from their mums. So either the kitten's family doesn't have it and there is no need or the kitten's family does have it and the vaccine won't work. Also it's effectiveness is still questionable. \n\nWe lost a kitten to FIP and were told just to hope our other kitten from a different mother fought it off better. So now we just get to live in paranoia for 2 more years until she's passed the deadliest window.Ah, yah then that was for feline leukemia probably. They just approved a new drug, sorry I don't recall the name, it is extremely expensive and they have to be on it for two months IIRC. I've only heard of a few cats that have been on it. It's about 50/50 but I assume that the farther they are along with it, the less chance of it workingI worry about this. I'm immunosuppressed. We foster cats and I have no room where I can be quarantined if I do get it.This particular coronavirus seems to be really bad at infecting dogs\n\nWhew! I guess I\u2019m safe then!\n\nI\u2019ll see myself out.> This particular coronavirus seems to be really bad at infecting dogs, even though dogs have their own coronaviruses that do infect them.\n\nDid you mean to say cats?In our case, maybe the heart attack did have an underlying cause, but then again, they do have to die of something at some point, unfortunately. Luckily, her mate, who is also 11, is still going (somewhat) strong.\n\nAlso, suppose it was possible to transfer covid-19 to a rabbit (I don't know), would it then not be likely that you would have infected all of them and not just one?Yeah, that\u2019s true. Certainly makes it more difficult on the margins and if you\u2019re spending a lot of time near feral cats. But mostly, it\u2019s not something to be concerned about personally getting from your cat. I think we agree those two things are both true.A couple of months into cat owning my cat was acting weird so I bent down to make eye contact to try assure her everything was ok and while I was talking to her she sneezed directly into my open mouth.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most harrowing things that\u2019s ever happened to me. What do you do? Other than a lot of rinsing and considering your poor life choices.Tell that to my cat who will sneeze on my face to wake me up in the morning.Both of my cats, I swear, purposely come up to our faces (or any part of our body if face isn't immediately accessible) to sneeze. Mind you they were very sick kittens with cat herpes when we saved them, so this is probably a permanent thing with them (the sneezing. They are both 11 yo now... But the sneezing in our face is new) .. But these last few months, they have been sneezing more in our faces. Like they hold it or something. Never see them just randomly sneeze.My cat loves to get right up in my face and lick my nose. He's sneezed right in my mouth plenty of times.I keep getting conflicting information on whether L-lysine actually helps. One vet says to use it and another says it doesn't work. (Vets at the same animal hospital)Well unless your cat is hitting up the town and being handled by a lot of strangers? Odds are you would have infected your cat. Or someone else in your household. Which means, odds are? You'd already have it.I'm in the camp where I don't mes swith any animals mouth/droppings in my mouth/face. Pass.True. Everything would technically fall under 'signs' in case of animals. Or you could maybe extend the definition is symptoms to \"those described by their caretakers\". I am no expert. I am just chiming in with what I know.Animals show symptoms of sickness, no? Cough, lack of appetite, lethargy etcNot necessarily \u2013 this is what's meant by \u201casymptomatic\u201d.What were the gi symptoms?UrnsUnfortunately some of her customers still insist on being close talkers, paying with cash that they've licked their fingers to separate, and open mouth coughing across the counter. Doesn't help that management doesn't want anyone wearing masks or gloves either, because they \"make the customers uncomfortable\"Because it's very important data for the scientists who are trying to save us all, and it only took one testWell, I imagine it's because there was known exposure to a worker than was positive for COVID, and possible spread to other species is very important information. I also doubt that human medical supplies were used for the test, but I could be wrong. \n\nWhile I dont know who ran the test, it seems more likely that it was performed by a veterinary lab, such as IDEXX (vet diagnostic lab that has been randomly testing feline respiratory PCR panels for COVID).That part's easy.  You're less valuable than a tiger in a zoo.Because vets are different than people doctorsWhy do you think you\u2019re more important than a tiger?from the article I read, animal testing does not interfere with or delay human testing in any way since they are different tests (animal tests) done in different labs (veterinary labs)Why are humans more important than tigers? Ugh the speciesism.> I think they meant more....why? I can't get tested even though my coworker's wife tested positive and I sit 5 feet away from the guy and my wife is immunocompromised, but a goddamn tiger got a test?\n\nThere are few thousand tigers but over 7 billion people.Sorry, Carole.That's not going to help the average owner who won't take it to the vet.I wish the vet who said my cat was fine, before he died 2 days later was trained.I had the same thing happen to my cat! I am glad your kitty recovered ! Mine did too thankfully.Oh oops it was saying that they can't get it a d I thought it was saying that it wouldn't affect them if they did get it. My mistake !I am not a doctor but that was true for SARS and its likely true for coronavirus. Would explain why it seems to hit Healthcare workers so hard.The data supports that, which is why younger doctors have passed awayFingers crossed it stays that way! One less thing to be worried about.Do you know if it was death or just illness?I had a persistent and *violent* cough for 3 weeks in December. It was so strong, it was waking me up at night  It was so bad and long, I assumed it's allergies since I recently adopted a cat back then. But then after almost a month the cough went away. The weird thing is I had no other symptom. No fever, no fatigue, no runny nose, no sore throat, no pain etc just dry cough.\n\nSo unless COVID was in Boston in December (which seems pretty much impossible to be) it was just some other random viral illness. My point is there are tons and tons of virus out there. Just because you coughed for a long time, I don't think you can assume it's COVID. But you never know. Stay healthy!Never hurts to talk to your doctor about testing.  We will have to do massive testing to identify people who have had this so we can gauge how quickly we can reopen schools, public venues. \n\nIf you are at higher risk, it would be good for you to know so you don't have to live like a hermit forever.Mine was like, bam pneumonia. Usually I would have a cold for a while before it turned into pneumonia but I had no symptoms aside from a sore throat until it was suddenly full on pneumonia and chest pain. \n\nI was denied a test but told to assume I had it and quarantine.All the butt stuff.The only long term effect is that I thought my sense of smell would never come back. It was about 4 weeks before I could really eat meat again because meat without any smell or taste is actually nasty.I'm what they call a presumed positive. Doctors can use the ICD diagnosis for cv19 without the test.  I have to get a confirmation blood test when they become available.  \n\nI'm actually working with covid patients by choice right now because my docs are so confident I'm through it.  If they're wrong, I'll haunt them.But cat deaths aren\u2019t tracked and reported to the health department like human deaths are, right?Same for mine being indoors. I feel like my windows suck and still let in pollen and stuff since it\u2019s an old Appartment and the seals probably aren\u2019t too great. \n\nBut yeah hopefully it\u2019s just allergies for yours! Fingers crossed.To add to this, any news source trying to play up the danger of infection for cats and dogs when the studies do not show a significant risk should be held responsible for any spike in pet abandonment we see from panicked people thinking they can catch it from their cat.I can't keep my cats away from me. I haven't been able to sleep properly for over a week because of worrying that I'm going to get it and pass it to them and they will die.  One of my cats is so sweet and insists on being right in my face as much as possible.  I cant bare to lose her. This whole thing is so awful. I just wish everyone could be okay and safe.My cats are indoor only so I have no concerns there and I can delay non-critical vet care but one of mine absolutely had to go in recently and even be hospitalized for a few days due to a bout of cholangitis.  \n\n\nMy vet takes the pandemic seriously (curbside only now, masks, etc) and I trust them but it is concerning that others had to handle my cat before she was returned to us.  It's probably low risk but just another scary vector to be concerned with.  Nothing I can do but be sure we wash our hands and segregate her should she show any respiratory symptoms.Thanks for actual good infoSure , but I love my furry buddies I don't want them to feel sick even if it doesn't do any harm. Er on the side of caution isn't such a bad thing :)[removed][removed][removed][removed]I just wanted to say thank you for rescuing Sammy. No matter how short your time was together, at least they were in a comfortable and loving place.I'm sure Sammy's last few months meant everything to him.  You are a good person.You made Sammy's life worth living. I think that is something to feel very good about. It may have only been three months, but it's all he remembered. \u2764\ufe0fThat happened to my Charlie. Shelter told us it was kennel cough  (we didn't know cats don't get it). Within 3 months of being adopted the disease attacked his spine and he went crippled. We tried every experimental medication on the market before deciding it was no longer morally right to keep him alive. Had to put him down. One of the worst days of my lifeGood luck! Our rescue currently has a few being treated and it's changed their quality of life majorly ,We're on day 83 of 91! (Messed up the first week,  so doing an extra week) Best of luck to youthere is no vaccine that works for FCoV/FIP, but there -IS- treatment. most vets do not know about it. it has many different street names but it's created with GS-441524 and comes from china. it was in clinical trials for a long time but got put on hold due to wanting FDA approval for humans before felines. because of that, it's blackmarket. gilead is blocking the use of it as it's being used in trials for humans, known as \"Remdesivir.\"I\u2019m sorry! That cannot be easy.\n\nI\u2019ll just ask that if you do decide to give away your cats, please don\u2019t release them. Cats are really bad for the local ecosystem and birds, and kill billions of birds every year. They\u2019re better kept indoors.Nope.  I meant dogs.  There were people saying that they knew it would infect cats because cats get coronaviruses.\n\nWhat I am illustrating is that *all* (or at least most) mammals have coronaviruses, but *this* specific coronavirus only infects certain mammals.  Humans, horseshoe bats, presumably pangolins, and felids, maybe all feloids.  There might be other mammal genera that it infects well, but dogs (canids) appear to not be one of them.She didn't get along with the other three and had to be kept in separate spaces. I thought she needed the company of other rabbits but she just never clicked with any of them. The other buns are much younger than she is (Valentine is 7 and the girls are 3.5) and they all get along well with each other but are still shy with us so we're around them but we don't have the same level of contact.\n\nShe was our first rabbit and admittedly, a bit spoiled. So that she wouldn't get lonely we let her have free range to our living areas. She was a tiny Netherland Dwarf and she'd sit on my chest and fall asleep while I pet her. She'd follow me around the apartment hoping I'd give her a treat.That bunny got me through some hard times.One of my cats is immunocompromised and a few years back she caught a cold that never goes away (vet has seen her, she's stable but the cold is here to stay). She sneezes near, on, and at me all the time. I have gotten cat snot in my eye.\n\nIt's disgusting and I try not to think about it.For what it's worth, making eye contact is probably *not* how you should be trying to reassure your cat. You might try the [slow blink](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/cat-body-language#1) instead, as eye contact is likely to be perceived as threatening.>so I bent down to make eye contact to try assure her everything was ok \n\nHilarious cat sneezes aside, this may not be the best strategy next time. I don't want to make a big deal out of it cause it's not and you seem like a good cat owner, but direct eye contact generally stresses cats out. Anecdotally, all the cats I've met aren't real keen on eye contact unless sleepy-eyed slow blinking is involved. Among other cats, sustained eye contact is threatening and a challenge, and leads to escalation of hostilities.\n\nIf my cat is stressed out and I want to comfort him, I'll lay down near him and pet him a little. Then just remain close if he seems to want some reassurance. You can also try to distract him with play but it it's something extreme and ongoing like fireworks it seems like getting jarred out of play time just makes it worse.Rub hand sanitizer on your tongue?a couple of my cats had the notion that sneezing in my face was the best place to sneeze. It was so disgusting.I foster cats mainly with cat flu. They are full of sneezes.\nI just wash my face and rinse out my mouth. Splash my eyes with water if I can.[deleted]I have seen conflicting papers on this issue, too. I am also of the mindset that it can\u2019t really hurt. Since it does combat outbreaks of respiratory infections, it sort of seems like now might be the time to give that extra boost.[deleted]I was thinking it\u2019s possible he could have picked it up sniffing around my shoes or something. Hope I don\u2019t have it! I\u2019ve felt fine so far.Looking up the definition, you're right but the definition I found is that a symptom is something that is *apparent* to the patient. Which doesn't really help since it is impossible to kno if the cat knows about the effects of the disease they are aware of. Unless they actively paw at it or show a sign, we don't know if it's a symptom technically which is weird to think about.Correct. Not all signs have symptoms. A lesion in the lung of patient having TB could be asymptomatic. And there are other sings such as lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly that a patient is highly likely to be unaware of.Presumably emesis and/or diarrhea are the only symptoms you\u2019d notice outwardly in a cat. They can\u2019t really tell you if their stomach is hurting or describe anything else.[The animal lived in close contact with its owner, and started showing symptoms a week after its owner did. \u201cThe cat had diarrhoea, kept vomiting and had breathing difficulties. The researchers found the virus in the cat\u2019s faeces,\u201d he added.](https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/103003/coronavirus-belgian-woman-infected-her-cat/)\n\nAnother good read: https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/belgium-all-news/103146/the-curious-case-of-the-cat-with-corona-liege-ghent-veterinary-virology/Well management has no choice any longer. CDC recommends essential workers wear cloth face coverings. \n\nAlso that behavior should be called into PSHA or the city/county heath authority. If we have an outbreak in our pharmacies, that could impact our most vulnerable very quickly.r/rareinsultstigers are an endangered species!\n\nCovid19: hello humans, let me introduce myself.I deserve this.I'm sorry to hear about your cat, I know it's tough, but unfortunately vets are fallible and most still can detect most of the time when pets are in pain even if you can't.I couldn't tell you about that case, but I could tell you when they have several cats concentrated doses of COVID 19 to infect them and test, several didn't show symptoms at all, several just had minor symptoms such as a cough, and they ended up putting down something like 4 of the cats, but I don't know if it because they were unwilling to invest in more than some very basic medical care. Even spreading the virus between the cats in this unrealistic lab conditions was pretty rareI had everything though idk about the fever but the sore throat the fatigue the pains I had it all and then the cough came after that. But I work in an area where it was possible I could\u2019ve came in contact with it I think.My co worker had almost exactly this. She was diagnosed with walking pneumonianover video.  She's fine now. They denied her a test for Covid-19.\n\nWe carpooled together. I'm happy that they closed everything down.  I didn't have any symptoms other than maybe some fatigue one day.   I assume she had it. I probably had it.\n\nWe also both have cats. My cat has been extra skittish but that's because we're always on zoom for work. The cat is hearing many new voices through the speaker.  Now she's adjusted and has been super cuddly.\n\nAnyway. Glad you're good.Do you mind sharing your age bracket?Youre thinking of the other COVID-19, Colon Videos 19.No, but it would still be highly visible. Widespread urban cat deaths in across the globe would certainly be noticed, kind of like  the increase in urban bird deaths during the west nile virus outbreak in 2002.\n\nEDIT: after doing some searching, it appears that the USDA has an office of [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_and_Plant_Health_Inspection_Service) which is tasked with monitoring zoonotic diseases, among other things.Yea this is actually motivating me to be way more careful when at work. I don't wanna hurt my baby.Sending you internet hugs.[removed]Thank you \u2764\ufe0fThank you \u2764\ufe0fThere is a vaccine.  Source: https://www.drugs.com/vet/felocell-fip.htmlYou can't just release foster cats. There are contacts in place.No I'd never do that. I'm 100% inside only cats, unless they are feral working cats. I've tamed a few of those too.Ahh I see! Thank you, that makes sense.\n\nI wasn\u2019t entirely sure since the article talked about cats, so thought I\u2019d clarify. Wasn\u2019t sure when you said \u201creally bad\u201d if it\u2019s bad for the dogs when infected or if it was really bad at getting the dogs infected. \n\nAppreciate the very informative response!Interestingly the rabbit that died here was also a tiny Netherland Dwarf, called Ukkie. Which means something like 'tiny one' in Dutch.\n\nLet's hope the rest of your bunch makes it to at least 11, which is certainly not that bad an age for rabbits to get to. It appears to me they have quite a high quality of life at your place anyway.Now I'm picturing you walking around (when we could do that), and someone pointing out that you had what looked like snot on your sleeve. And you assuring them, \"Oh, it's okay, it's not mine.\"I adopted a six year old cat from a friend of a friend. He sneezed all the time, boogers everywhere, crusty nose all the time. The previous owner\u2019s vet couldn\u2019t find a cause. My vet couldn\u2019t find a cause. But years later I got a new vet and they recommended an intense course of antibiotics, suspecting it was a deep deep sinus infection. So we went every two weeks for an injection of antibiotics. I think we spent 3-4 months doing this (maybe as many as six months). And lo and behold, his sinuses cleared up! No more snog globules everywhere!Oh goodness, my cat is recovering from sinus surgery and sneezes in my face all the time, a few weeks ago he snotted all over my glasses, I'm so glad I had them onBah, you're lucky. I was reading a book when my cat decided to come parade her brown starfish at me. Suddenly I hear a *fweet* and feel moisture in my hand. The was a brown speckling across both my hand and book. Never did get the book cleanMy cat has the same thing. I believe she has herpes or something similar because she\u2019s indoor/outdoor. If your kitty goes outside, she quite likely has something like that. It\u2019s incredibly contagious and most outdoor cats have it.\n\nI hope your kitty feels better! If mine is particularly icky, I put her in the bathroom with the shower steam. Not for long. It helps get it out.Did the vet DX cat herpes? Several of my cats have chronic outbreaks of it starting when I got a cat at a shelter who gave it to the others. I've tried the prescribed antivirals without success. Right now the vet has the ones with recurring outbreaks on otc generic zyrtec (1/2 tab once per day) to reduce the sneezing runny nose plus 1/4 tsp lysine in baby food. picky twerps only will eat it in jar human baby meat. One in her midteens still gets a secondary bacterial infection every few months requiring antibiotics poor thing.Ah yeah sorry, sloppy writing! Slow blinking was exactly what I meant :) if I tried to stare her out she\u2019d straight up murder me.Just anecdotally, my cat loves eye contact and exchanging glances is a big way of how we communicate with each other. She likes me to watch her while she eats and she\u2019ll stare at me and get me to make eye contact before she starts. When she wants to start playing chase, she\u2019ll assume the stance and look meaningfully at me and start running when we make eye contact. \n\nBut we\u2019ve been together long enough that I think she feels confident I would never threaten her.I make eye contact with my cats, but half lidded when I'm trying to reassure them (squinty eyed cats typically are feeling safe, while big eyed cats are typically scared/upset/in-hunt-mode). I've noticed that all of them that I've know will start with their eyes wide when I do this, then slowly half lid their own eyes and relax (if they weren't already).I think a shot of vodka would be more tolerable.At this point I just assume if any of my cats have something that can be passed to me then I already have it. One of them decide to use my face as a trampoline other day as I was laying in bed. His entire foot went into my mouth, and his claws scratched the vestibule of my lower lip. My entire chin hurt for like a week because of that tiny disgusting scratch.Thanks for letting me knowI agree. Thank you for your responseWell, even then. If you had it on your shoes, you likely had it elsewhere on your body. Unless someone leaned down and exclusively sneezed on your shoes.\n\nYou'd need to have had direct contact with the virus to bring it home. Sucks, but if your cat did catch it? Odds are you did already as well. Could be asymptomatic. Or maybe it's not covid at all. But it's still worth being careful and isolating over.Where do you work27\n\nI'm healed now. Only lasted about a week of noticeable symtoms. But was scary because I am supposed to be higher risk due to having bronchitis and pneumonia several times.[removed]Thanks!Aww, binky free sweet Ukkie!Yeah, my guy doesn't really get threatened when I make sustained eye contact, it's more of an intense play signal.  He'll stare at me when he wants to play. And if I do it when my face is within striking distance, he will very likely have a go at my face.\n\nBut the person I was responding to said they were only \"a couple months into\" adopting the cat. For a cat you've only known a couple months, making eye contact is not a recommended way to \"assure her everything is ok\"Yep, slow blinking is definitely a great way to relax a cat! But it's definitely something very different from human \"eye contact\". And making eye contact in cat language isn't a threat for a second or two, it's sustained eye contact that's more threatening. But getting your face within mouth-sneezing distance and locking eyes will likely do more harm than good.Everclear is stronger.I gag just thinking about what you wrote. I wouldn't have tolerated that from my cats and would have laid down the law with a very stern talking to.[deleted]Glad to hear! Hope you have a long and fantastic life!Lolol sounds like you have a real sassy boy on your hands. He sounds adorable.Thank you!Thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

And what makes processing \"bad\" as is implied?[removed][removed]\u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\u201d\n\nSolid advice.Honest question: what's the least-processed food you can find in a supermarket that's affordable, nutritious, and lasts a while on your shelf?\n\nMaybe rice and beans?I heard American food being discussed on a science radio show in Australia. They were talking about how the American food industry evolved out of an initiative for food supplies to remain on a permanent war footing; the food is dense in calories and can be mass produced easily. The idea being that they're always ready to feed a population of people during a crisis. One could probably infer that not much thought was given to the long term effects of a population on this diet.  \nI'll edit this post if I can find a link to the radio show I was listening to.[removed][removed][removed][deleted][removed]This is literally an instance of \"you get what you pay for\". Those soy burgers I assume would score both high on processing score and not sure where on healtfullness but I assume higher but presumably higher than say processed sugars and fats. \n\nThe soy burgers sell by me for 4 for $8.99 (more than meat burgers). Other processed foods on the scale sell at the dollar store.\n\nI'm not sure processing should be a negative thing, but I know this will be construed that way.[removed]Of all the stock photos you could choose to illustrate junk food, you choose a picture of Sweet Baby Rays? How dare you.Ultra-processed sounds like pointless fearmongering buzzwords.I don\u2019t know why people are surprised by stuff like this. I figure we\u2019re at a point we\u2019re efficiency is key in the mass production of goods. Whatever cost the least resources but gives just as good results. Of course everything is being synthesized in labs, it\u2019s right for the times. As bad as it may be, that\u2019s why all these videos exposing farms and stuff don\u2019t phase me. After all this time of people working the same role, it\u2019s inevitable to get to a point we\u2019re it\u2019s just fucked up.[removed][removed]**Summary:** This study included data representing over 80% of all packaged food and beverages in the US. The four levels of processing include \u2018unprocessed or minimally processed foods\u2019 (e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables), \u2018processed culinary ingredients\u2019 (e.g., salt, sugar), \u2018processed foods\u2019 (e.g., canned vegetables, cheese) and \u2018ultra-processed food and drink products\u2019 (e.g., carbonated drinks, breakfast cereals, cakes). \n\nIn this study, 71% of products were classified as ultra-processed. Eggs were the only major food category where 0% of products were 'ultra-processed'. 100% of products in foods for specific dietary use, snack foods and confectionary categories in this study were 'ultra-processed'.\n\nLink: [https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704)[removed]All bottled salad dressings, for the most part...Time to buy some land and stardew it up.the upside to these products is that they usually have a ridiculously long shelf life (relatively speaking),  the downside is that they offer little to no nutritional value[removed]Step 1. Learn to cook. \nStep 2. Eat whole foods.[deleted]And, according to some very preliminary research, this is part of why IBS and IBD are so prevalent in America and becoming more so.Yeah. Well its the whole culture now of i want it yesterday. Convenience is the order of the day. No hunter gatherers anymore. We buy things for immediate gratification because its easy. In a shiny packet like a magpies dream. We have domain be it food or . whatever. We show our offspring the same virtues. Perpetuate the cycle of fast food culture and disregard questions so long as my belly doesnt rumble\nUntil we lie in a bed near the end with tubes protruding like a borg hooked up to a generator\nThe joys of being a human parasite and a so called modern citizenIve done a bit of traveling. America was by far the worst food of any country i have been to so far. Lovley people though!Ah yes. \u201cultra processed.\u201d But tell me of the true threat \u201cmega processed\u201d foods. Those are 56% more processed than mere \u201cultra processed\u201d foods.I knew a guy from Europe who said our food tasted like plastic to him for the first two weeks he was hereSo how do we fix it? Alot of people these days are good at pointing out problems, but too few action takers...Strictly anecdotal but I've been to over 40 countries and the U.S. had by far the worst food, both fresh and processed.Avoid the aisles. You can do it. That's where all the veggies and protein are. Avoid boxes and cans.It would be interesting to see someone chart the rise of use of these products with the rise of cancer and see how they match up.No wonder they are causing havoc to people\u2019s bodies. Cereals nowadays are the worst. Instead of starting with a good breakfast, you end up starting off with processed starch and sugar with some bgh laced milk.[deleted]Stay on the perimeter of the grocery store.wonder why people here have so many allergies? theres your answerNot surprised at all tbhI try to follow the saying \"if it comes from the ground or had a mother,  you can eat it.\" Generally speaking.  It makes it easier to decide what to eat and what not to eat. I also follow \"bread makes you spread\".Not sure why people are surprised.Yes indeed. Humans are having trouble staying alive on this diet.I\u2019ll take facts that shockingly won\u2019t shock you, Alex.So the tin foil hat health people have been right all along?I work in the supply chain for this stuff, I supply starches, glutens, and sweeteners. Feel free to AMA related to that.As far as I know a lot of processed food products came into the market during the war, or right after. So did other countries go back to cooking meals from scratch and America stuck with it, or do other countries do this too? (I think I know the answer.) \n\nIf America just stuck with these wartime food products, it\u2019s like the country is living in the past. Although people have learned to cook better via cooking shows like Julia Child and Jacques Pepin.My buddy went to Thailand, ate relatively unhealthy and drank beer the whole time and lost 5 lbs. He said though he wasn\u2019t eating particularly healthy everything he was eating was fresh.I had psoriasis joint pains depression fatigue and ibs.  As soon as I switched to a plant based diet all improved or completely gone.   It was the psoriasis going that surprised most people because it was a visible thing.Eat with moderate consideration and this isn't an issue....\n\nIt's suprising how easily forgotten famine is and how ensuring calorie availability is a major issue...\n\nI guess with upcoming crop failures some will learn... Sadly it will be those who are already all too awareDon't buy this disease-creating garbage.Whole foods plant based \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude0aSo I've been eating science? SweetWow, this is perfect timing.  I have a meeting in 3 hours about collaborating with a local community geoup for a fresh food initiative.And the general public is just a collection of lab rats.Why is this news to people?I can't stress this enough. Shop the outside of the grocery store. If it isn't a dried spice or salt, and it isn't refrigerated, it isn't food.And vegan food like  synthetic meat are some of the most processed of this type of lab food.Which is exactly why Americans are unhealthy. They load these foods with sugar and its addictive. Then couple that with the fact that people can really afford to buy high quality food in the United States anymore unless you make really good money.\n\n\nBuy land, learn to grow vegetables and be self-sustaining because you cannot count on the powers-that-be.[deleted]I love all these high and mighty replies about only buying fresh stuff or avoiding parts of stores. \n\nSo as a young adult living on my own barely getting by, I should garden and buy organic produce? I try to cook for myself every night but certain processed things I can\u2019t avoid. I have to buy mass produced bread because I can\u2019t eat a whole loaf in a week and need the preservatives. I buy frozen veggies and heat those up with meals. I go to work every day and don\u2019t have time for making myself pasta from scratch every night, never mind having a pasta machine so I have to buy noodles. I buy cans of tomato sauce and make my own marinara. Sometimes I even buy prepackaged pizza dough mix if I want a treat. \n\nThese are all processed foods that allow me to make my own meals without sacrificing, say rent or tuition. I understand that for a stable working middle aged adult making foods from scratch should be the norm but for people like me it simply doesn\u2019t work. \n\nWhat people don\u2019t realize is that it\u2019s not the processed foods or \u201cchemicals\u201d (which are often times found in unprocessed things anyways) are bad, it\u2019s that foods are full of refined sugars and fats and high in sodium. People need to recognize that they\u2019re eating too much and have very sedentary lifestyles. I live an active and sustainable lifestyle on processed foods because I recognize how much I need to eat, that I\u2019m having too much sugar or fat and adjust accordingly. We\u2019re ok eating fast food or chips or ice cream once and a while, as long as it\u2019s not an everyday thing. People need to chill. This article is just clickbait fearmongering.\n\nEdit: spelling> laboratories\n \nRead: high-tech factoriesThat is the reason why Americans are getting fatter and developing tons of health problems. But do worry, big pharma has a pill or two to make you feel like a million bucks while your body decays! How sad!Shoot, try finding any of the foods you buy without some kind of added sugar... Cane, brown, stevia, monk fruit, honey, brown rice syrup or one of the many hip new alcohol sugars... From what I've been explained to by manufacturers is that foods are somewhat priced by the calories they provide. Sugars are super cheap to produce and drive up the \"value\" of the product. On top of that it of course makes it taste better and some studies would even say more addictive, especially the more refined ones.This title is something else.That is absolutely terrible. And they wonder why obesity is on the rise. And cancer haha haha. Just 'll one that buried study of sugarYeah, I stopped buying packaged or canned food after realizing that it\u2019s really not that cheaper than buying fresh produce or meats to prepare a meal that lasts a day or more. Not to mention those foods are usually super high on preservatives and/or salt. I\u2019m trying not to get diabetes or cancer here.If you are not eating whole foods and cooking from scratch, you are dying faster.[removed]And this is why I consume a whole plant food dietA chemistry boom in the 50s opened up a whole new world in the food industry. Being able to replicate colors and flavors in a test tube was revolutionary.I moved to Europe and I have to say the food available in the USA is horrid. It's either cheap garbage or expensive with few ingredients. Here I can go to the bio market and buy cheap food, usually cheaper than non bio food. Bread here lasts a couple days vs the mutant bread in the USA that lasts for a month and has 50 ingredients. Moving here made me realize how the food business has Americans by the balls. Not sure why bio food is cheaper here but I think it's due to more awareness of food ingredients. Consumers inspect ingredients like hawks.This sentence makes no sense.Yea everything in the USA is fake. Food, TV, social media, politics, culture, and did I mention the people.I don't think the part about hydrogenated oils is true anymore. I recall the FDA announcing a year or two ago that they are unsafe. I know a few products I buy used to contain hydrogenated oil.I assume people can eat what they want. If they don't want \"ultra-processed,\" don't eat it. If they don't know enough about it, learn more. It really bothers me that people here seem to think it's all someone else's fault. Take some personal responsibility for your health.Damn I'm outta breath just reading that title. Phew.Just eat more whole fruits and vegetablesWhy are you teaching me this late at night after I basically just ingested poison?!? I hate youThis is why I changed my nutrition intake to fit an athletic lifestyle.American food are junkPeople are eating way too much than they need without having much physical activity. That's the main problem. Not \"processed foods, which existed throughout human history.  Certain \"modified\" food ingredients are in-fact much better than those \"natural\" ingredients because they are made to comply regulations. Nowadays, word \"natural\", related to food, has no meaning.And we're still living longer than ever. \n\nBring on the ultra-processed ultra-pasteurized goods!The food industry is like the scientific community and it's relationship with the military. Ingenious solutions for problems are created for the purpose of betterment of humanity, then military/corps come along and use it for evil. Here we've made a chemical that tastes like sugar with a single calorie, excellent now we can sweeten inedible things like cranberries! Pure evil.How dare people buy things that are for sale?Nestles new allergen free chocolate chips are soo much better than the originals. All ingredients are cocoa butter, sugar, and cocoa powderPAY FOR HIGH QUALITY FOOD NOW OR PAY FOR HIGH QUALITY DOCTORS LATER.\nEITHER WAY EVERYONE PAYS!\n\n>this message was sponsored by Whole ~~Paycheck~~ Foodsi think this coupled with beyond meat kinda stuff, coupled with CWD & the fact that plants store CWD in their walls, im horrified theres some insidious plan to make nature illegal to eat.You're not taking my Sweet Baby Rays\"It's people! It's people!!!\"Just walk along the outside perimeter of the grocery aisles. There\u2019s plenty of foods you can eat with one ingredient.This may be a stupid question, but is this based off of \"groups?\" IE if you walk into a store to buy chicken thighs you're likely to see two brands, big-store and small-store. If you want barbecue sauce there's 30 different brands with five different flavors each.   \n\nIf it's just the \"accessories,\" I'm cool with this. I don't tend to add much to my main meal anyways. If they're saying my New York strip is 85% glucose I'm gonna be a bit more concerned (and irritated)There are a lot of things I can't eat because I am sensitive to preservatives. It sucks.\"More than 70% of America's...\"\n\nOf course. XDJust tell me flat out. Am I gonna get cancer from eating Kraft Dinner?Fortified with over 100 vitamins & minerals!Good. \n\n\nI hope those scientists were upset by their findingsBut yet some of the hottest start ups are working on further pushing the boundaries of processed food by creating man made meat and egg substitutes. I find it hard to reconcile the known benefits of eating unprocessed or lightly processed foods with these new \"miracle\" foods such as the Impossible burger and Beyond Eggs, which are being pushed as healthier ways to save the planet.This isn't just any processed food... It's ULTRA processed...Im a part of these numbers!But are they inherently harmful?Reservoir pumps use excess electricity during the day.But can I still gain weight if I eat these foods?Make America Fat again... wait.\ud83c\udfb6\u201dnnnothinng-iss-reeeall\u201d\ud83c\udfb6This must be partially to blame for the rampant obesity issue in America, right?What's the percentage of packaged foods .?36% of US adults are obese. #1 of OECD countries.Can this possibly be associated to the obesity problem I keep hearing about here in the USA?I\u2019m not even gonna read this because I know it\u2019s going to mention Oreos and I\u2019m never quitting them.Fresh/Natural != Good\n\nArtificial/Pre-packaged != Bad[deleted]I need to ask an honest question right here.\n\nAccording to what the headline on the post, most pf the food is synthesized in a laboratory? Did I understand that part correctly?\n\nIf yes, then can we derive from that statement that they are literally engineering foods to make us unhealthy and fat on purpose?\n\nAgain, please politely clear up any misconception. But it sounds a lot like they are deliberately engineering food that will make us unhealthy.I bet \"Minimally Processed\" will become a marketing gimmick.I don't have time to cook.. I'm too tired from earning money to buy processed food so I don't have to cook.Does that mean it tastes better?This headline looks like it just packed as many clickbaity buzzwords into as few words as possible. \n\nIs a food that is an \"industrial formulation\" dangerous in any way? Does it being \"synthesized in laboratories\" make it more dangerous? Is \"modified starch\" worse than unmodified starch?President Camacho approves.We\u2019re already pretty low on processed foods. Trying to move completely away starting with bread. It\u2019s been about 3 weeks now and I\u2019m getting good at baking my own bread. Next will be crackers. \n\nThe big problem is schools. If you have a kid in school and they give them snacks, you can\u2019t stop the kid from getting it.Would this 70% include food replacement powders?Alright, so? Food is really cheap to buy, the health risks are incredibly minimal or at least extremely speculative by most accounts, and that all sounds pretty positive to me.What am I supposed to eat? SOMEBODY TELL MEOk but what are the other groups?   Fourth and final.   What?  What are the othersBecause \" *Natural Ingredients\" does not mean what we think it means.*\n\n*Read the back ingredients section when shopping*Well that took long enoughIf it comes in a package or bottle just ask yourself this: could I conceivably make this at home?\n\nOnce I started doing that I didn\u2019t necessarily buy less packaged stuff, I just got more aware and made smarter decisions.\n\nI still buy hummus, it\u2019s cleaner and easier than home made for me. I stopped buying tzatziki, it\u2019s literally just yogurt and dill. I make all my dressings and I never buy premade spices combinations (taco seasoning, etc). Examples like these abound. You\u2019ll be surprised what you can easily make. Since\u00a0about 80% of Americans\u2019 total calorie consumption comes from  store-bought foods and beverages (packaged and unpackaged), the food and  beverage supply plays a central role in the development of chronic  disease including obesity and cardiovascular disease.\u00a0\u00a0Dammit, here I was thinking my white castle burgers that I've been eating all my life was some usda prime gourmet ground beef burgers.Well that's one explanation for our degrading health....This will make it so much easier for them to accept lab grown meats in the near future, they clearly don\u2019t know the difference anyway.[removed]Christ... Anti gmo people are almost as bad as anti vaxxers. Without GMOs farming, and food in general, becomes much more wasteful.\n\nAlso, without \"gmo\" plants, we wouldn't have: modern wheat, edible corn, Brussel sprouts, cauliflower... The list goes on.\n\nIf you want misshapen vegetables that spoil immediately, that's what they eat in third world countries.. So go for it.I find the strongest leg to stand on when it comes to being anti-GMO is the actual land use practices that go into growing corn, soy, wheat, and others. They are ecologically destructive by means of soil erosion, water quality degradation and overall input intensity into these systems is not sustainable (herbicides, fertilizer etc.) \n\nWhen you treat the earth like a factory it really does have innumerable externalities.Can you explain this further?Thank you for saying this! Also when i tell people that most modern fruits and vegetables have been selectively bread to be big, look nice, have longer shelf life, and higher in sugar. And not nutrient content they dont like that either.Thing that blows my mind is the vegans I've talked to who don't have time to cook, and since the diet is so crazy restrictive they eat almost strictly processed food. Like, how is that good for you? (I know the answer)I work in a food lab, and the majority of our time is spent figuring out how to get rid of \u201cbad\u201d ingredients, but still being able to make everything taste/feel the same. It\u2019s challenging, and to be honest, we DO rely on processing changes. We have to. It\u2019s frustrating when everyone thinks the food industry is basically some demonic chemical happy executive paying some mad scientist in a lab to turn your food into plastic without you noticing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my whole lab could be filmed as a comedy, but only because we all have awfully raunchy senses of humor.Don't forget how we have now added refined sugar to just about everything we eat. Nothing is killing us faster than the obscene amount of sugar we eat.I wonder if, similarly to Upton Sinclair\u2019s book (which was a critique on the cruelties and brutality of capitalism, as he was a devout socialist) this new book will be misinterpreted in some way no one really expects.I mean, the horrifying working conditions are still there, too. It was only three years ago that there was a big report about poultry processors wearing diapers because they were denied bathroom breaks, and the injury rate for meat processing workers is much higher than the average worker.We've all heard it before, but we should be doing our shopping in the outside ring of stores....buying produce, fruits, vegetables, a little fish/meat/dairy - and generally avoiding all the inside aisles which contain the majority of the ultra-processed foods high in sugar/salt and most of the things we're meant to avoid.Processing food is not inherently bad. The main problem is that we have too much fat, sugar, meat and starch, not that it's prossesedCheck out Salt Sugar Fat. Very good book about food production and testing.There is that book (kinda) - Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser. There's a specific chapter that tackles the processing and chemical tweaking of food.Good luck. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ag-gagUltra-Processed Foods List\n\nIn the NOVA report, Monteiro includes an extensive list of ultra-processed food examples:\n\nSoft drinks\n\nPackaged bread and buns\n\nChips\n\nCandy\n\nStore-bought ice cream\n\nBoxed cake mix\n\nInstant noodles\n\nInfant formula\n\nBreakfast cereal\n\nEnergy bars\n\nFlavored yogurt\n\nChicken nuggets\n\nFast food burgers\n\nHot dogs\n\n\nAccording to\u00a0Monteiro\u2019s 2016 NOVA report, ultra-processed foods often include\u00a0long ingredient lists\u00a0and\u00a0additives\u00a0such as artificial flavors,\u00a0added sugars, stabilizers, preservatives, and more.\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2018, a report in\u00a0The British Medical Journaluncovered a link between ultra-processed foods and an\u00a0increased risk for cancer. And now, most recently, a study from\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicineassociated a high consumption of ultra-processed food with an\u00a0earlier death.Looking through [the paper the article references](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704/htm) the authors don't state that food being processed is necessarily bad, however it is correlated with having a lower nutritional value from the data the authors collected. Looking over the data almost every category of processed foods except confectioneries and bread have an even distribution of high and low nutritional items.\n\nFrom the paper's introduction:\nBecause most calories consumed by Americans derive from processed food and beverage sources, and because high levels of processing are associated with nutritionally-poor products [8,9], the level of processing among foods and beverages can also be included as part of an overall assessment of healthfulness[deleted]Food Scientist here, processed food is basically considered anything done to food above what a consumer can do at home in their own kitchen. Whether it\u2019s good or bad depends on sooo many factors, especially what type of food it is and *where* the processing is taking place. The US and EU have pretty strict guidelines.don't know but I lowered my processed food consumption by like 90% and my body completely changed for the better.A lot of people have already answered this, what I haven't seen  well put among those that mentioned nutrituinal value is that processed food has a high risk of reducing raw material to its primary nutritions causing malnutrition. You will get a lot of processed food that has enough protein, carbs and fat a human needs but vitamins and other micronutrients will partially be destroyed by the processing. \n\nProducers might choose to retrospectively put some \"back\" by supplementing them artificially which does not necessary guarantee the same nutritional value. If you destroy a goods inherent macronutritions and thrown in Vitamin C because it's cheap you're just trying to make your product look better than it is.\n\nThere is also a problem of adding a lot of cheap spices and preservatives to make the product lasting and tasty - those can be a burden on people's digestive systems. Salt is a great preservative but it's also so overused most people have an excessive sodium intake.\n\nA diet that consists primarily of processed food is overall prone to create deficiencies in one place and excess nutrition in another because some chemical structures break over time or change under the influence of processing methods like heating or freezing.There was a good study that showed that with ultra processed food people tend to overeat if they aren't watching.  This is probably due to the fact the food is made to be very tasty.  And the food is usually more calorically dense.\n\nNothing in it is generally 'bad' if you track what you eat and don't overeat though.In the nutritional context, they're usually referring to taking out good stuff, and adding bad stuff. Like a lot fruit juices: remove the fruit, add sugar.  White bread: taking out healthy parts of the grains (using white flour instead of whole grain), adding sugar and salt.  There's also just preparation methods that inherently add health risks, as is often the case with processed meats like bacon, sausage, jerky, etc.  The curing, drying, smoking etc results in harmful, carcinogenic compounds. Ontop they'll often add a lot of salt.These \"processed\" are designed to optimize profits via throughput and cheap ingredients, so their constrained by what cheap, and uniformly easy to engineer around. This results in high percentages of low-grade oils, sugars, and carbohydrates.\n\nThey lack significant nutrition, and are actively damaging to metabolic processes in such high concentrations, especially when consumed _to the exclusion of real food_, which happens more as their industrial efficiencies win out.\n\nBecause the mission of \"food\" corporations is to charge high prices for what's low cost to make, we've ended up with \"food\" systems that are untethered from human needs.[deleted]Processing food isn't bad, that's just pop health myth. But the more processed food is, the more likely it is to be junk foodThey aren't by necessity bad, but they are by probability bad. Our bodies have evolved expecting a certain environment. That incudes what nutrition is available and its abundance. We haven't evolved for situations outside of that, such as the food processing that we do and whenever something is much different than what our bodies were tuned for there's a good chance that it will throw the balance of the system, our body, off. Now there's also a really really small chance that the change will be positive with our body design, and that chance is a bit bigger because we're generally trying to come up with things that won't harm us. However, since our bodies are so complicated there's a pretty good chance that we're missing something as we make changes, and furthermore the intentions of the companies pushing these changes aren't necessarily in line with your health.[removed][removed]That book (and Omnivores Dilemma) were my catalyst for turning vegetarian. Would highly recommend for anyone curious about food culture in the US today and what actually goes into making ultra-processed foodsMichael Pollan! I love his thoughts on food :) So reasonable!It\u2019s really this simple tbhAlso, \"everything in moderation\". You can treat yourself to over-processed, store-bought ice cream, but not every day for every meal.A bag of dried lentils 100%20lb sacks of beans and rice. Frozen vegetables are fairly inexpensive as well and still healthy. Canned vegetables can also a good option. Like canned whole tomatoes or beans. You can usually get decent fresh cuts of meat for <$3/lb as well to round out your protein and fats. All will last for a week or more on the shelf/fridge or much longer frozen.Any vegetable? Most vegetables last a pretty long time especially if you leave them somewhere that\u2019s cold and dark.Maybe it kind of started that way but I think what really drives the difference between American food and European food is the urban sprawl and general larger distances between homes, work, stores in US.  This drove the dominance of the supermarket one stop shops.  The little corner grocery store is now generally expensive, charging a premium for convenience.  In Germany, there's a little grocery store and a bakery every 1000 feet.  It's practically treated as your pantry.  No reason to stock up at home or buy quantities that would spoil.  No need to treat food for extra long shelf life. Thus, more whole foods.  In US you buy as much as you can fit into the cart when you go grocery shopping so you don't have to do it again for 2 weeks, which, is kinda nice, and the selection is second to none... but it comes at a cost.  EU has waaay higher quality food and it's cheaper too.  You can find good food in US but you usually have to find \"that one good store\" or a legit farmers market.As a young adult living on my own, that\u2019s the only economically sustainable solution for me. I can\u2019t eat a whole loaf in 5 days and can\u2019t afford to be buying that much bread. People get all high and mighty about their \u201cnatural food choices without preservatives\u201d while in reality that\u2019s just not doable for everyone. Guys, it\u2019s not that the processing or chemicals itself is bad, it\u2019s that these foods are typically sugar-rich, calorie dense foods which we don\u2019t need to be eating as much of. In my case, preservatives allow me to pay for other stuff, like rent or tuition.[removed]Keep it in the fridge, it lasts longerMost Americans could do with a lot less \"bread\" in their diet[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]It should be clearer that it's 71% of **products** and not measured by weight or volume.\n\nA supermarket might stock 9 kinds of fresh potatoes and 200 kinds of frozen meals with french fries.  The study measures SKUs equally, but this headline leaves readers to assume it refers to weight.> 71% of products \n\nIn other words, for every kind of carrot there are three or four brands of carrot chips and carrot puffs. I'm not surprised. How well do they each sell though? What does it look like as a share of grocery spending or calorie consumption?[removed]Well when it comes to bread my grocery store has their own bakery - they charge the same as processed bread.\n\nI guess the caveat is that it only lasts 4-5 days before getting hard (at this point you can just make toast) and a week til moldy - but when it's fresh it also tastes a million times better.I feel like a bigger issue may be the vagueness of the term. For example: is a tortilla processed by definition? The corn is ground and pressed after all. \n\nA bit of stickler thinking, but similar examples may warrant a mere for more specific terms.[removed][removed]The OP clarifies [in a second post that isn't at the top](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/cj1mxj/more_than_70_of_americas_packaged_food_supply_is/evaj8yo/) what that means.  \n  \n>As classified by the NOVA Food Classification Systemdeveloped at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, \u201cultra-processed food and beverages\u201d is the fourth and final group of foods that \u201care industrial formulations made entirely or mostly from substances extracted from foods (oils, fats, sugar, starch and proteins).\u201d They are derived from hydrogenated fats and modified starch, and are synthesized in laboratories.  \n  \nIt might be used by others as fearmongering buzzwords but the source link didn't pull the phrase out of its ass.It is. It basicly means junk food, which is the problem, not really the processing part[removed]I would argue you\u2019re grossly oversimplifying the issue. Ultra processed means more and more of what makes the food \u201cfood\u201d is being stripped away, like fiber. That\u2019s a key variable in satiety, causing people to eat even more ultra processed foods. Could we do without the word \u201cultra?\u201d Sure. But your statement seemingly implies that really these types of foods are just like any other, when they are clearly not. These are more like food-like substances than actual foodI still have yet to hear a single, consistent definition of a \"processed food\".  To me, everything people have listed as their own definitions has been the equivalent of prepping food for consumption. \n\nTake food, prep food, add spices/preservatives/chemicals, cook food, serve/package food. \n\nI do that in my kitchen everytime I cook a meal.  Now, one could make an argument about the individual ingredients themselves (food coloring, too much salt, too much sugar, not enough vitamins, etc.), but almost every meal ever consumed is a \"processed food\", except maybe a salad, and even then you had to prep and maybe add spices or dressing.There's [evidence](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-finds-heavily-processed-foods-cause-overeating-weight-gain) that heavily processed food is indeed terrible health-wise. Claiming so is not at all \"unscientific\".\n\nBut claiming that unprocessed food is good per se is. There's plenty of unprocessed diets that are terrible for your health.I mean I feel like I\u2019m on fairly firm ground by stating that going out to my garden and picking a ripe green pepper to munch on is a healthier choice than a hotdog and chips.Almost all forms of \"processing\" used in commercial food prep involves removing the naturally occuring fiber from food that satiates your hunger. \n\nSo it's really not a problem eating processed foods, except that it makes it way, way easier to consume more calories. \n\neg. I would never eat 6 apples in one sitting, but I could certainly sit down and drink 16oz container of apple juice. \n\nHeck, we feed that to children as a drink. In fact, almost all \"100% juice\" blends in the US contain apple juice as a first ingredient because it's almost sickeningly sweet and it's cheap.[deleted]Clearly you've never been to a boneless chicken farm. Those cute little chicken blobs clucking and rolling around the farmyard like saline breast implants are just great.Stuff that makes things cheaper and increases shelf life tends to have some tradeoffs. Maybe the taste is worse, maybe there's all sorts of fillers added to make it taste better. Low fat yogourt for example, uses guar gum to make it taste thicker, but the mouth feel is slightly plasticky compared to a true 18% full fat yogourt. \"Butter\" cookies made with palm oil and soy lecithin are not going to be as good as real butter cookies.\n\nWe already know that artificially hydrogenated fats often contain a mix of cis- and trans-fats, and the trans-fats are really bad for you.whole foods is too expensive. Eat half foods.Do you have a source for that study that actually sources a study and not references itself in a cycle? It keeps mentioning \"This NEW published study!\" without ever using any references to a study.You\u2019re mistaking correlation for causation. Just because life expectancy has gone up along with the advent of processed foods doesn\u2019t mean the two are working together. I\u2019d argue the advances in medicine are what are increasing life expectancy. The sad part is that a lot of people (talking America here) reaching later age are in poor, poor health and are being held together by machines. Does processed food play a part in that poor health state? I\u2019d argue it doesUltra-processed foods lead to higher calorie intake. That's the slippery slope.\n\nThey're in large parts the reason why America is the fattest country on earth bar some pacific microstates. Americans aren't somehow magically more inclined to overeating. It's not even a cultural thing, as seen by obesity statistics of [2nd generation immigrants.](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/128/4/701/4728868)\n\nIf you want to tackle the obesity epidemic in the US, you have to tackle ultra processed food first.Most food in the US tastes so bad it's not even funny. Yeah it's cheap, but damn is it disgusting.Stick to whole foods and mostly plant-based. Beans, lentils, local fresh produce are extremely budget friendly.Thanks i had never heard the full quote.Canning by itslef is a perfectly legit storage method. Just read the ingredient list.Yep, my weekly trip to the grocery store completely skirts the outside with brief detours for  seasoning, trail mix, energy drinks, water, and household supplies.What about cooking with these so called processed foods? Boxed pasta to make your own spaghetti, etc.If you cook bread, it\u2019s a level 3 processed food \nhttps://educhange.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdfBut... what if I need cleaning supplies, or toilet paper? =(I think it\u2019s the hygiene hypothesis personally. Americans love their hand sanitizer.had similar results with different issues except I went full alkaline for a couple of months, then just continued to follow plant based lifestyle.Sometimes you find the best comment in the thread when you sort by controversial.Freeze the loaf and take out the slices you need. \nPasta takes maximum 10 minutes to cook. Even less if you pre boil the water in a kettle. \n\n\nCooking from scratch is significantly cheaper than buying products. You can also save a tonne of time by bulk cooking on your days off and eating that through out the week. I eat a balanced healthy diet of 3 meals a day + snacks for \u00a315 ~ $20 a week and manage to cook fresh for every meal on top of working 13 hour shifts.What you described commonly buying are what I would consider to be processed but not ultra processed. Ultra processed foods tend to be foods stripped of nutrients such as fibre and vitamins but highly calorie dense. Dieticians are not saying eat no processed foods such as commercially made whole grain bread, pasta, or even having a weekly frozen pizza night. They\u2019re saying avoid relying too heavily on things like white bread, chips, pizza pops, and soda for every meal every day.  \n\nEveryone on this thread is reacting as if people are trying to say that we need to grow and mill our own grain to make bread.  It\u2019s a stupid straw man argument.  Poverty is real however. It\u2019s fucked up that we blame those in our society with the least when the questions we need to be asking are: Why do governments subsidize high fructose corn syrup? Why are our incomes stagnant? Why are food companies allowed to be misleading in labeling their products? Why do we refuse to make nutrition a core part of everyone\u2019s education?\n\nEdited: oops didn\u2019t edit writing before uploadingNoStevia or monk fruit aren\u2019t sugars but sugar/excess carbs itself is a big problem.  It\u2019s added to things that have no need to have it added except its cheap.  Prepared meals will come with potatoes, corn, rice, or bread because it\u2019s cheap rather than vegetables.  We have low fat cream cheese which just replaces all the fats with sugars and people believe it\u2019s healthier this way. Margarine was created out of the idea that butter was bad for you and then we learned that it wasn\u2019t the case and trans fats also did more harm than anything.We are really what we eat. Researches show that gut-brain connection are important not just to our health, but also mental well being and performance.The bomb we rocketed into your hut last week was pretty realWe are living longer due to medical advancement, not processed food.My stepdad\u2019s father has all sorts of metabolic issues from a lifetime of bad diet and exercise (diabetes, several heart attacks, a stroke).

Dried fruit.\n\nEdit: added items[removed][removed][removed]Well, it's not quite as clear cut as that. GMOs have obviously helped deal with problems we've had in farming, but it's important that we retain a diversity, so that one fungus/bacteria doesn't wipe out half of a region's crops. \n\nThis is often why people worry about GMOs, they often reduce crop/species diversity in a way that makes the risk of epidemics higher.\n\n--Edit: many of you have pointed out that this isn't why most people worry about this, and you are probably correct. I'm leaving the original text, but I want to point out that I got the message.--\n\nWell, that and some GMO-manufacturing companies' business practices.\n\nDisclaimer; I am in favor of GMO use, but a sober view on things is really important.Not all who have issues with gmo are against all gmo\n\nThe issues are many: Gene Patents restricting farmers from using seed produces by their own crop because of cross pollination from gmo crops, gene infiltration underming extant stocks, unknown long term consequences, etc etc etc\n\nThere are plenty of very valid reasons to have issues with gmo crops...You are conflating selective breeding and genetic modification. The two are different things.\n\nIf you think non-GMO veggies are misshapen or spoil immediately, someone has been feeding you a load of bull.>Without GMOs farming, and food in general, becomes much more wasteful.\n\nSources?\n\n\nAnd this one is,  \"If you want misshapen vegetables that spoil immediately, that's what they eat in third world countries.. So go for it.\"\n\nI don't know what to say.GMO is different than selective breeding.As someone who grew up in a country with a strong agricultural culture I can say our vegetables are well shaped, and don't spoil immediately. Also you don't have to worry that much about spoilage when you eat them within a couple days from harvestUtter nonsense, seriously. GMO would be great if I could trust the corporations doing it, but I don't. If it would be regulated what you can do, if there were any oversight whatsoever. Then I would be in favour.\n\nBut as long as large corporations can try random genes in crops, and just put them out there on fields. Who knows what that can do longterm to our ecosystem. Just like introducing new species into a biosphere, the consequences are impossible to estimate.\n\nThey are banned in quite some countries in europe, and there are valid concerns about them.\n\nSure, there is world hunger, so that can raise some ethic questions. But don't just put it in the same box as vaccines.\n\n(note: I am not concerned about GMO in my food. I am concerned about the effect of GMO crops in the ecosystem)That's not true: I live in a non-GMO country and there's plenty of corn, cauliflower, etc. This is also one of the top economies in the world. Stop lying.The problem with your statement is that most GMO crops use fewer pesticides and fewer fertilizer treatments than non-GMO versions of those crops.Except GMOs are a response to those issues not the cause. GMOs are located in areas of soil erosion, poor water quality etc. because they\u2019re the only plants that survive that, not because they are the cause, and I doubt you could find a peer reviewed source that lists those as potential risks[deleted]The issue is that most GMO processes actually involve selective breeding. Use of pesticides and fertilizers are not removed from \"organic\" crops, only limited in type. There are dozens of ways to be just as disruptive with \"organic\" methods as there are with other methods, it all just stems down to best practices and who actually follows them.Pretty much all agriculture is destructive and certainly it\u2019s going to be destructive if you want to be able to feed the soon to be 10 billion humans on planet earth. The main and most effective way to deal with the problem is to minimize consumption/demand, and that means switching to a diet that requires less land, less fertilizer, less water, etc, as well as not throwing away so much of the food we already produce. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say we shouldn\u2019t work towards better agriculture practices as well, but it\u2019s not the most effective way to deal with the problem. It\u2019s secondary to the main problem.Well non-GMO crops aren't going to use any less land than there GMO alternatives.Except GMOs use fewer resources and less land than traditional organic farming, so you should be pro-GMO for that exact reason.While I don't think any (many?) people in the food industry are bad, I view a lot of what has happened as the unfortunate results of chasing demand. No one, broadly speaking, is cackling with glee at ruining health. Instead, it is a lot of well-meaning people doing their jobs to the best of their abilities, giving people what they want as evidenced by what they buy.\n\nI'm not faulting anyone, including people like yourself, but the outcome, even if you just take a look at obesity and type 2 diabetes rates over time, it's pretty obvious that the majority of foods available to us (once again, driven by consumer demand), are taking a toll.It always seems to me that the executive decisions are made with the sole interest of cutting costs and increasing profits. I don't believe they want to make the food unhealthy intentionally, it's just a byproduct of \"good business.\"\n\nEdit: I saw a reply that stated that most people in the industry aren't bad people. I agree with this, my point refers to the influence of high power executives.[removed]When you say \"we have to\", expand on that if you can. Is it mainly about cost of production? Crazy losses due to perishable dates if you don't? Legal requirements? Safety? \n\nWe customers wonder at times what was wrong with food 50 years ago.It\u2019s tempting to think of that disparagingly, but without this type of specialized process of food production aided by modern chemistry, we probably could not feed anywhere near the number of people we do now.>  turn your food into plastic without you noticing\n\nWell, 70% of our food into fats and starch. Only we're beginning to notice. Next step is taking steps to regulate the food industry. Because what's been happening is not currently transparent or honest.That field fascinates me.

None of these things are unhealthy in moderation. It\u2019s the snack and convenience foods that also live in those aisles that are unhealthy.Sounds like the old Bible story of Adam & Eve and the apple.\n\nTell them they can only eat from the outer ring of the grocery store, but not the inner part. THEN WHY PUT THE INNER PART THERE? It's a case of setting them up for failure.\n\nEdit: grammarYour statements are technically correct but you are ignoring that we eat too much *because it's processed*.\n\nI can't eat 3 apples at once but if remove the pulp of those 3 apples it's about 1 cup of apple juice.

The way everyone frames it is that additives in general are somehow responsible, rather than the known and substantial risks of a very sugary, salty, and calorie dense diet.[deleted][removed]A long ingredient list isn\u2019t inherently bad though. Hell, you can have ten-plus ingredients just for spices and seasonings in some dishes. Just the seasoning I put on chicken often has a dozen or more ingredients, so if I season some chicken with it, add a few vegetables, and throw it over some rice, I\u2019m looking at ~20 ingredients.It is a very weak connection. I mean going off that list which is mostly high sugar foods you probably shouldn't also be surprised to see an earlier death from heart disease or other obesity related ailments.\n\nAisde from artificial sweeteners, which does get to be some freaky chemistry, there isn't much of anything in modern food that hasn't been around for a long time before food labs were a thing. Take preservatives. Usually hyped up to be scary sounding chemicals, but the primary one is just normal sodium chloride. Other forms of common preservatives are mostly done physically, from fermenting to pickling. From freezing to dehydrating. From vacuum sealing to pasturizing.\n\nReally defining something as any level of processed is just an arbitrary line. Take Kraft singles. Though it is commonly known as American cheese, there is a second form of American cheese, which is basically just cheddar that was specifically made in America which, in colonial times, had developed its own version of the cheese cultures used in Europe. What makes Kraft unique is instead of cheese cultures, it uses gelatin TO bind milk proteins. Ironically I believe Kraft does sell traditional American cheese from cultures under the \"Deli Select\" branding.\n\nOr Wonderbread. Which became so wonderful when it reinforced the bread with vitamins that were destroyed from the baking and flour milling processes.[deleted]Oh good, its just my entire lifestyle that is wrongI don't get half of these... Candy can be as simple as caramel. Flavored yogurt is milk plus culture plus, say, fruit. My packaged bread literally has no ingredients that don't belong in *any* bread, it's just packaged without air. Instant noodles are just dehydrated soup.Bro chips got three ingredients explainHow is boxed cake mix ultra-processed? It's the same stuff I would put in a cake made from scratch, just all pre-mixed for me. And yogurt? It has to be processed and cultured in order for it to exist.> There was a good study that showed that with ultra processed food people tend to overeat if they aren't watching. This is probably due to the fact the food is made to be very tasty. And the food is usually more calorically dense.\n\nStudy that was posted on reddit last week showed that people who ate processed food ate more calories than people eating unprocessed food, even when macros and such were balanced. The reason was that processed food was simply easier to eat\u2014it required less cutting, chewing, etc\u2014so people ate more of it in the same amount of time (time it takes your body to do the whole 'I'm not hungry anymore' thing).[deleted]By contrast what are some highly processed healthy foods? I'm struggling to even think of some. Protein powders maybe?[removed]Why do people always say stuff like this and not name what they're talking about?

He does a great job of not being too didactic about it, clearly.Lentils, probably started civilization as we know it.  No tigers, long hunts, animal husbandry, or sharpening spears and you have enough protein and fiber to survive.Buy whatever meat is on special. Cut into individual portions and vacuum seal. If you can't afford a sealer see if you have friends who can chip in and all use it. Buy bulk rolls of vacuum bag material on Amazon.Where is this magical land where theres meat for <$3/lb?root vegetables, you can even pickle them to last a lot longer.In Germany bakeries are closing because they can\u2019t compete with mass produced bread from Lidl & co. We\u2019re also heading in the wrong direction. Furthermore, most bakeries are chains & sell frozen products that are heated up every day (M\u00fcller, z\u00f6ttl, & co)> You can find good food in US but you usually have to find \"that one good store\" or a legit farmers market.\n\nIMO highly exaggerated. I have never been in a single large grocery store and had any difficulty finding unprocessed foods.\n\nThere are absolutely food deserts in cities and for folks without transportation, but as soon as you have a car is 100% on the individual choices.\n\nCan anyone actually name a national chain that doesn't carry fruits veggies, and the other basics?You could freeze your breadin the old days people would let bread go stale instead of mouldy.\n\nthen stale bread would be made into other dishes like french toast, or pudding.\n\ni have no idea of what your budget is like but i hope you are doing wellThe reason it\u2019s not doable for everyone is because you don\u2019t have access to a cheap bakery that produces fresh cheap bread daily, and if there is a baker near you he or she is probably out of your way, this is a culture problem, the US likes to keep everything in grocery stores or restaurants.I buy organic bread that molds in a few days but keep it in the fridge and it molds in a few weeks instead, leaving me to slowly eat my way through my bread.Not to mention that the \"natural food choices without preservatives\" crowd are probably throwing away tons of food because it went bad before they could eat it but God forbid an E (for evil) NUMBER enters their precious bodies! The lack of basic scientific education and critical reasoning is baffling.It's so hard to grocery shop living alone. Everything pareishable comes with too much to finish before it goes bad. We need more bulk groceries.[removed]Or even better, the freezer. Bread takes all of 10 minutes to defrost.Don't keep bread in the fridge, it'll go stale faster. Freezing it is better.[removed][removed][removed][removed][removed]And not measured by consumption.And people can continue to invent processed foods, pushing that percentage up higher, but it is pretty hard to come up with new unprocessed foods.The sheer size and perishable nature of produce sections at any decent grocery story suggests they sell FAR more fresh produce. Why on Earth would they give up ~25% of their retail space to products that have a shelf life measured in days when they can go for items that have shelf lives measured in decades.Put it in the freezer.Fresh baked bread is a level 3 processed food.\nhttps://educhange.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdfThe thing is, do you think the supermarket tortillas are made just by pressing grounding corn and pressing it? Not even at home, you start with the flour. Supermarket products have like 15 ingredients when tortillas need like 3.Everything you do to food is processing. By cooking you are making processed food.[removed][removed]Can you think of something ultra processed which is healthy for you?Well in this article they are referring to the [NOVA food classification system](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nova), and [here is an article](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2019/05/21/ultra-processed-diet-leads-to-extra-calories-weight-gain/) discussing a relatively small study that compared processed vs unprocessed diets with equivalent macro-nutrients (but variable quantity)Maybe it\u2019s about being able to control the amount of sugar and types of fats that go into food when you prepare vs \u201cprocessed\u201d.Many processed foods are healthy: tea, raw cacao powder, rolled oats, canned beans, etc.\n\nThe problem is when you take something from the nature and take away too much of the healthy stuff. Wheat flour as an example: you take the most nutritionally poor part of the plant, then dry and grind it which furthermore destroys some of the few nutrients.\n\nDon't get hung up on the terminology. I mean exercise is healthy, right? Running 50 miles is exercise, correct? But running 50 miles every day is not healthy. Just as you can't say \"all exercise is good\", you can't say \"all processed food is unhealthy\" either.It's all complete nonsense.  They're the same people that protest GMOs.That study basically says that people eat more calories when they eat highly processed foods.  To me, that suggests it's more calorie dense not that it's inherently unhealthy.Wondrous imageryIt\u2019s almost like making foods as calorie dense as possible for as cheap as possible has been our #1 goal with food since the beginning of time.\n\nOnly now we have gotten so good at it that in the US our poorest people are the fattest people. This is the first time in the history of humanity that this is the case. \n\nGenerational advice about eating has become a detriment. \u201cFinish your plate\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t waste food\u201d \u201cEat as much as you can\u201d \u201cEat until you are full.\u201d This advice makes no sense if you have food at a near endless supply. But those people who have that advice lived during a time in which food was scarce. \n\nI think the best advice we can give is, eat until you are satisfied, not until you are full. I\u2019ve intentionally started practicing to leave food on my plate to break the mental block of feeling like I need to finish my plate. \n\nIf you eat out, box it or toss it. You are saving no money by eating more food and you are actually teaching your body to overeat which will have serious consequences later in life.I was disgusted by the taste of pop tarts when a friend brought it from USAAbsolutely. Plenty of healthy options with canned legumes and vegetablesCanning is a genius idea but brands often dump more salt and sugar in to compensate for the metallic taste.seasonings, Cheez Balls, and seltzer water are about the only thing I go in the middle for. sometimes frozen veggies if I know I'm too lazy to wash and chop fresh, which isn't even all that fresh in regular grocery stores.Hopefully you don't eat toilet paper too much.Poop on the perimeter and don\u2019t clean it upI think it\u2019s the high alkaline that has helped improve my health.   I certainly avoid dairy and sugarVery true.  The microbiome is being understood much better but few seem aware of it yet.   Change is slow.It's a shame. Remember when we were recommend 8-12 servings of grain per day? Processed or not I'm sure that didn't help much.[removed]The domestication of plants and it\u2019s study is called ethnobotany. \n\nTraditional phenotypic artificial selection was the way we have guided the evolution of modern food until the industrialization of the genetic age.  \n\nWe must pursue both phenotypic and genetic avenues if we wish to feed the growing world with what we have left. \n\nI\u2019d like to present the idea of 5 flavors of human guided evolution of food:\n\nTraditional breeding programs (save the best to be the next generation) UC Davis has a program that is responsible for things like the modern strawberry. \n\nSame species genetic modification. \n(Amplify/Attenuate genes)\n\nCross species genetic modification. \n(Put potato genes in tomato plant)\n\nCross kingdom genetic modification. \n(Put fish genes in plants)\n\nArtificial genetic modification (imagine if u/SrGrafo wrote DNA)\n\nI\u2019m sure there is more i could add... hmmm. \n\nCheck out the free documentary Botany of Desire if you wanna know more.People who are super anti GMO are almost never referring to the mono culture issueThat's monoculture as a problem, not GMO.> This is often why people worry about GMOs\n\nNo it isn't. *Often* why people worry about GMOs is because they don't understand science and are scared of it. *Occasionally* people might have an actual thought out argument about biodiversity in agriculture, but not often.Monoculture have been going on a long time, and you can't blame gmo on that.\n\nYou can't even blame extensive herbicide (like round up) use on gmo, because the actual amount and potency of herbicide use has gone down since the invention of roundup ready corn.The United Nations, the U.S. gov't and a few others keep living samples of all pre-GPO crops just in case I worked for UN in this field).That's.... Not why people are anti-gmo in general.\n\nIt's the same anti-intellectual hype as antivaxxers. GMOs are bad, they are poison, they cause health issues, they can't be trusted, they aren't nutritional....etc\n\nNot that GMOs are causing a monoculture problem that could lead to a catastrophic failure in our food supplies. Which is a legitimate problem to go after.Monoculture in farming way pre-order dated GMO technology. Look at the Cavendish banana, for example.Exactly---most people I've known who are against GMOs are against the patenting of seeds and the food supply---it's a dangerous precedent.    As usual people conflate convo to the lowest common denominator and ignore valid criticism.Actually no. \"Traditional\" breeding is not merely selective breeding. We have been doing mutagenic plant breeding for decades now, where we try to induce mutations with ionizing radiation and breed the most successful variants. This is unequivocally a form of genetic modification, yet is not considered GMO.Exactly. It's the same amount of work and inputs but with twice the yield.  What has changed is the genetics it the plant.\n\nSource:  I used to work for government ag agency,  big ag company,  and my husband is a plant geneticistThe only problem is using the term or word at this point, GMO. Its just a scapegoat.Organic is in fact more disruptive to the environment, strangely enough. Due to smaller yields, they require 25%-110% more land to produce the same amount of crop. They also contribute to soil eutrophication 37% more than industrial methods which lead to hypoxic waterways and coastal regions.Not to mention that organic growing practices generally fund animal agriculture, which uses a lot of land as well.>The issue is that most GMO processes actually involve selective breeding. \n\nThat does agriculture, both ancient and contemporary, as well.>The issue is that most GMO processes actually involve selective breeding.\n\nYou just described horticulture at almost a dictionary definition.All reasonable studies point to sugar (fructose to be specific) being a major health problem, but there's a lot of money backing the side that says not to do anything about it.  So while we could say the same about the mid 1900s tobacco companies, they were just offering what people wanted, and preventing legislation to stop them from following those trends- I'd still say those in the positions of power are bad people.  Not the employees, necessarily.That\u2019s the inherent result of capitalism. No one has to mean ill, but when profit is priority over all else, a lot of important aspects get shorted and they compound one another until no one bats an eye when Coca-Cola hires mercenaries to kill labor leaders in foreign countries.There are absolutely unethical people in the food industry. I speak from personal experience.Capitalism doesn\u2019t care about our health, even if food scientists genuinely do.  As long as food companies interests are are driven by their stock prices, we will always be consumption driven rather than health and nutrition driven.On the plus side, you *really* have to try to starve to death these days.That's capitalismHigh power executives juggle with demand for product (which lets them make more money, which means they can hire more people/have greater profit share) and image of the company (which may necessitate donations, striving for change, research). Yeah they cut costs and try to increase profits - but if people are eating it, its hard to deny what they are doing, at least for their workers/company. If we want to do something about the externality of what they are doing (which is making people obese), we need to intervene with governmental laws.The goal of any company logically is to make money by providing a good or service that people want. That doesn't have to involve fraud or injury, but certainly can with bad people in charge.[removed]Well, it\u2019s more like- if a food has been made the same way for fifty years, but all of a sudden customers no longer want a certain functional ingredient- we have to figure it out. So, what do you do? You can\u2019t just take it out and expect the food to react the same, because it\u2019s functional. So either we replace ingredients, or we change the way we cook the food. Change the way we add ingredients? Change the temperature at one step or another? Maybe we get creative. Sometimes we just throw stuff at the walls to see what sticks... all trying to get rid of something that maybe isn\u2019t detrimental at all, but someone in marketing read an article online and all of a sudden we have to change everything.We could tighten up on food waste for damn sure\n\nEdit- to say we shouldn't be okay with lower quality foods we should leverage our advances to do better, but it is easier to chase profits Fats aren't the problem. Removing fat and replacing it with sugar is the problem.We have laws in the US that require you to list all the ingredients and provide breakdowns of the calorie content, fat, sodium, sugar, etc. What is inadequate about this that you want to see changed?Completely on accident, actually! I started as a lab tech with a generic associates degree because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I do have a LOT of chemistry courses under my belt now ;)It's also very conveniently nebulous what constitutes a \"process.\" Basically, whatever the speaker doesn't like.My degree had a lot of chemistry based classes, and tbh they were my favorites. Since I\u2019m actually trying to specialize in one area, they were also super useful. A chemistry degree would definitely help if you want to work in R&DBut that\u2019s not the reason he wrote it. That\u2019s my point. He wrote it to further the cause of socialism but it\u2019s remembered for its portrayal of the meat industry. The legacy wasn\u2019t intended.[deleted][removed][removed][removed][removed]I would say that the salt isn't the problem. It might make a symptom of a problem worse but removing it will not solve the problem and will actually make matters worse. You can look for the study where they looked into salt intake and mortality rates for the elderly. The elderly who had lower salt intake than the average died more often. The only time when the elderly died more often with higher salt intake was when the amount was several times the official recommended amount.When ultraprocessed foods are mentioned in general journalism publications (or just non-scientific communication) the ledes normally point to or imply that additives and whatnot are the actual \"villains\". The thing is, the literature says that ultraprocesseds enable a poor diet, because they are normally very energy dense, hyperpalatable, readily available, long lasting and easy to eat.\n\nThe scientists aren't uncovering *\"a link between eating a bunch of sugary soft drinks, over-caffeinated energy drinks, salt heavy fast food, and breakfast cereal covered in sugar with earlier death\"*, but that a diet rich in ultraprocessed food is bad and may lead to adverse outcomes. If the focus was specific types of \"unhealthy\" food, they would study them specifically. The rationale goes beyond micronutrients and additives, but on the whole dietary pattern that involves a the excess consumption of ultraprocessed foods. According to NHANES data, the top quintile of dietary contribution of ultraprocessed food (as % of total energy intake) is > 74%, and the biggest single energy contributor in the ultraprocessed group is prepackaged mass produced bread.\n\nDon't miss the forest for the trees thinking of salt or caffeine in diet soda. Remember that non-processed food has to be prepared, doesn't last and is very hard to eat while lying in bed watching Netflix.[removed][removed]On most listeners they're just \"Seasoning and Spices\" as a single item in a comma separated list.  I often look for flavoring hints.I think it\u2019s irresponsible to put emotions into a scientific article. Things just have to be reported. If infant formula is processed, it\u2019s processed. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fFlavoured yogurt might mean just milk plus culture plus fruit as you say. It may also be milk plus culture plus artificial flavors plus artificial sweeteners/added sugar plus preservatives plus food coloring.cake you make from scratch has flour butter eggs sugar milk (basically, plus or minus whatever dietary preferences). boxed cake has a ton of stabilizers and other things that you wouldn\u2019t be adding at home. same with specifically flavored yogurt. plain yogurt has very few \u201cingredients\u201d but once you get into flavored or textured (ie whipped) yogurts the ingredient list becomes much longer.About yogurt, here we have one proper yogurt brand in the stores. It has 3 ingredients (milk, sugar, leaven) and optional flavoring which is pure (not processed jam kind of blend) berries etc. The other yogurts have 3+6 or more things of this and that, the biggest red flag for me are thickeners, like guar gum.TofuIn Defense of Food, I think.Also I just read that the word \"Lens\" is Latin for Lentil!  Because lenses look like beans \ud83d\ude0aMost places in the US outside of major cities? :PMidwestern US. Most raw non-organic chicken products can be found anywhere between .99 and 2.99 a pound. In Texas chicken breast is generally found for $1.99/lb at walmart and H.E.B. I was recently in Indiana and it was $1.69.Pickling is processingThat's sad.  Still... much better bread and meats than over here in US.  It does seem like you're getting more supermarkets but with the density over there, I think the smaller corner groceries will continue to provide an alternative.Dollar general?Very much exaggerated.\n\nMy local non-fancy \"everyman\" grocery store (HEB) has almost anything you can ask for. Common produce in regular and organic versions. A wide selection of somewhat \"unusual\" stuff as well.\n\nWide array of seafood, some farm raised, some wild, various qualities at various price points. Salmon for example: Farm Raised Atlantic, Wild Alaskan, and Norwegian ranging from $7 to $15 a lb.\n\nBeef ranging from cheap ground beef to aged prime steaks. Grass fed stuff, etc.\n\nPork, chicken and poultry of every variety ranging from cheap junk to organic, free-range, air-chilled.\n\nAlso tripe, turkey necks, pork feet and so on.\n\nIn-house bakery with really good stuff. Massive cheese selection from all over the world.\n\nBeer aisle with beer from 20+ local breweries.\n\nAmerican grocery stores are amazing. And i have spent enough time abroad to make a reasonable comparison.As a single dude that doesn't eat much at one time, a deep freezer changed my life.FYI I have been trying out different breads in the freezer, because I don't like the crumbly, fall apart texture of white bread after thawing/toasting. \n\nAs far as I can tell a highly seeded loaf is the best bet. The seeds seem to hold on to some moisture, and they absorb heat faster if you toast them.TIL not everyone stores their bread in the freezer.This. Buy fresh bread, decide how much you can eat in about two days, keep that part whole to preserve freshness, slicing just before eating.\n\nSlice and freeze all the rest. Reheat in a toaster, ideally in the following couple weeks, because bread will dry up relatively quickly in a domestic freezer.It seems to get stale or covered in ice very quickly.  Ziploc bags help but not for more than 2 weeks or so.In the old days people also used preservatives. Mainly salt. And also preservation techniques such as pickling.Culture, market, semantics. You say cheap bakery, but the problem is that specialized businesses are rarely cheap because they lack volume. You can blame culture all you want, but saying \"cheap bakeries\" instead of \"bakeries\" was a clever way to subvert the issue. Do you want to force bakeries to drop prices? That's a slippery, regulatory slope.Its impractical to visit 10 different stores for the various food groups. Thus, grocery stores.Bread is actually super easy and fun to make if you just make a simple loaf. I recommend. I'm addicted to baking bread now.Right.  American white bread is really a mild form of cake.  Yes, there's a decent amount of sugar in it.toaster does it in 2 from frozenStale is still better than moldy. Especially when I'm just gonna toast it anyway![removed][removed]A counter to that: it's expensive to run the freezers.  They want to stock just enough to cover demand, maybe a bit less since many people will buy an alternative when their favorite is out of stock.  You're not wrong either, they definitely sell the produce, but I think they sell both relatively quickly.\n\nThey have a bit more margin on chips and cereal since they don't spoil or require refrigeration, but even that takes up shelf space where something could be selling instead of sitting.>Processed foods are products manufactured by industry with the use of salt, sugar, oil or other substances (Group 2) added to natural or minimally processed foods (Group 1) to preserve or to make them more palatable. They are derived directly from foods and are recognized as versions of the original foods.\n\nSo because flour is made by grinding and the other ingredients are not, it counts as a processed food.[removed][removed]Protein isolate\n\nI really can\u2019t think of anything else.[deleted]I get your point and it\u2019s actually a really good one, but they usually are not very nutrient dense. Calorie dense foods with few nutrients are a challenge for dietitians.What the hell does unhealthy even mean to you then\n\nProcessed foods unconsciously promote overeating. We know obesity is at pandemic levels. On it's own, surely that's enough to call it unhealthy\n\nIf you need more you can consider the lack of nutrients, high proportion of trans fats and added sugars and white flour, preservatives and emulsifiers, and the contribution to the derangement of the gut microbiome.\n\nUnhealthy isn't the same as toxic. Chips don't instantly give you cancer. Still unhealthy though.Part of that reason is the lack of filling protein and fiber, which are inherently needed for healthy diets.> GROUP 3: PROCESSED FOODS\n>canned or bottled legumes or vegetables preserved in salt (brine) or vinegar, or by pickling[removed][removed]Excellent comment! came here to say I live in davis! (hometown) And also that botany of desire is a fantastic recommendation.atomic gardening is a neat way we modify plants as well,>imagine if u/SrGrafo wrote DNA\n\nSrGrafo, probably: [GENE EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/YlfpVUm.png)Anyone who is super anti-anything is almost always missing the main point.Imo GMO contribute a lot to monoculture. But yes, those are not same thing.Yes. The real enemy is monoculturization, not GMOs or even highly mechanized farming.\n\nBut GMOs, and generally the involvement of increasingly larger corporations in our food production, increases the rate of monoculturization by facilitating cost externalization. A simplistic set of inputs/outputs scales much easier than managing a complex system, which is really what farming has always been about.\n\nIn my opinion, employing robotics and AI to managing complex system is the innovation that is needed to solve many of our food production problems. And business innovations are necessary as well, to encourage small-plot farming economics where possible. Of course, there are many innovators already doing work in this arena. Here are a few of the more start-uppy companies I see with promise to help reverse monoculturization of farms:\n\n[https://www.swarmfarm.com/](https://www.swarmfarm.com/)\n\n[https://www.ecorobotix.com](https://www.ecorobotix.com/)\n\n[https://farm.bot/](https://farm.bot/)\n\n[https://www.propagateventures.com/](https://www.propagateventures.com/)\n\n[https://commonland.com/en](https://commonland.com/en)\n\n[https://www.grasslands-llc.com/](https://www.grasslands-llc.com/)It's not just monoculture (and it's mutual relationship with GMOs), that is the problem.  Over 80% of most staple crops in the US are GMO (and also annuals). If the end goal is food security, then ultimately, the blame falls on our tongues - that is - what we consider 'staple crops'.\n\nConsider - it is estimated that somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 plants found on this earth are edible. Yet a mere 100 or so of those species account for 90% of the global food supply. We\u2019ve limited our choices of edible plant matter to \\~.33% or less of what is actually biologically available. Sure, we may rearrange those 100 or so species into what seems like a massive amount of products, but if it\u2019s our ingenuity that is to be celebrated for this, imagine the products we could rearrange \\~30,000+ edible species into! Would we even be having this discussion if we were open to a more diverse amount of edible plant species becoming more common parts of our diet?The only people I've had debates about the monoculture side of GMOs are people that support science and the concept in general. \n\nEveryone else is just, politely, an idiot.Organic methods tend to use more land and more water. Farming intensification is a very good thing in terms of reducing land usage and getting more out of the land you do use - much more. That's where GMOs shine.\n\nThe other benefit to GMOs is they can be adapted to grow in places where they normally wouldn't, which means *less* soil alterations such as adding more nitrogen.\n\nOverall GMOs are much better for the planet, particularly when compared to non-GMO crops. And when you compare GMO land use to raising cattle, GMOs win by a country mile. GMOs take less water, less land, create less pollution and are carbon-negative as compared to cattle.\n\nIt's not unfair to call anti-GMO people crackpots, because they generally are. They refuse to acknowledge or often even hear of the benefits of GMO crops, they maintain a bunch of false beliefs, and their life mission seems to be to have a disproportionately large influence on whatever debate there is. If we'd just left this whole thing up to people with expert knowledge the concept of \"organic farming\" would be seen for the dark ages practice it is.It's not just money. Humans are hard wired to crave sugar because it has a lot of energy density. It is just far more available to us than it was for our evolutionary history[removed]Profits over sense. Old story told a thousand different new ways.I wonder how much of it is sugar being bad vs morbid obesity being bad\n\nI'm sure they're linked but I've seen quite a few in shape people eat a lot of sugarWhy would a company hire more people than they need? This is a ideal that just doesn't play out. Companies just got massive tax cuts, they didn't spring forth with jobs, they just did stock buybacks... As they said they would.This.  Replacing processed hydrogenated fats and sugar with natural fats like almonds and avocados is the answer.Bingo. I take my parents shopping sometimes and am trying to get this across to them (born in the 50s) and I just can't quite get it to sink in. It's too discouraging to accept that they were lied to, and in turn lied, their entire lives.How about the fact that \u201cportion sizes\u201d can be exploited to obfuscate what\u2019s in your food. \n\nFor example, something might say it has 0g of trans fat, when in reality you\u2019re not required to label anything at .5 or below. So just shrink the portion size, even if it\u2019s nowhere near the amount people generally eat in one sitting, so you can put zero on the label.Not really. Processes include physical alterations of a food- basically, applying temperature and pressure changes in one way or another. Ingredient additions are typically what people get mad at, but they lump it in as \u201cprocessed foods\u201d because they don\u2019t really know any betterI would go further and say that powerful people such as Roosevelt appropriated the book as a sign of poor food processing conditions, purposefully ignoring the socialist critique. It may have been harder to ignore the book in it's entirety[removed][removed]Salt itself is essential to life,  if you switch to a Whole Foods diet you\u2019d be surprised how often you would need to add additional salt to supplement your intake.[removed]yeah but he didn't blame the salt, his point is it all together is more problematic than a bag a chips. people's diets are the bigger problemYes it isn\u2019t the salt itself. It\u2019s the heavy salt in addition to high sugar and carbohydrates.So it's not the process so to say but eating it too much?Exactly, I believe this is a correlation not causation argument. By that I mean people who eat \u201cultra processed\u201d foods often eat too much consuming more fat and calories than needed because it\u2019s cheap, readily available, and tastes good. Not because eating this food here or there will kill you. It sounds people in this thread are saying \u201cif you eat a small serving of chips with lunch every day you\u2019re gonna die\u201d while in reality it\u2019s targeted towards those who only eat packaged dinners and soda, rarely differing.[removed]Sure, but that applies to everything that comes pre-packaged... Cheese may be just cheese, or it may be Cheez-wiz. Chocolate may be chocolate, or, I dunno, a Mars bar. Tomato sauce may be just that, or it could be Heinz ketchup. OJ could be OJ, or Sunny-D. I mean fine, it's fair to say most soft drinks are \"ultra-processed\" (even though I'm sure many are just fizzy juice), but half of these categories are ridiculously broad.... What's wrong with any of that?  Preservatives make it so you can... you know... actually buy the food before it goes bad.How are the stabilisers unhealthy?I'd claim that tofu is still significantly more nutritionally poor than raw soy beans (aka edamame).\n\nIt boils down to how you define healthy. Yeah, maybe tofu isn't carcinogenic or anything but if you compare it to whole food products with similar nutritional profile, namely beans, I bet that beans will win.True, but if you do your own, you control what goes in it.Wouldn't call that a super market, but unfortunately I think a lot of people use it as such.Not the traditional marriage, but I'm not judging.Well ideally you eat it fresh, made on the same day. But if you plan to eat it a few days later, it's better to freeze it.Love me some pickled bread.dude I buy a fresh made baguette for a dollar. Again, I don't know where you live but there's a lot of cheap fresh stuff near me- bakeries usually make money from supplying bread to restaurants or other shops around the city they are located in, that means they can sell bread from their shop really cheaply because that's not their primary market. Unfortunately, many people in the US don't have access to this, I say it's a culture problem because as you demonstrated, we're not used to fresh baked bread or products, city planners know that people are familiar with restaurants and malls and thats how they're gonna zone areas and that's how investors in property are going to decide to use that property, for something that's been proven that works (i.e. I won't rend my building to a baker because a small grocery store or restaurant is proven to make more money).But bakeries would have lower prices if they were doing the volume that European bakeries do, because   many more people are getting their bread there.  In the US, going to a baker is a luxury.  In Europe, it's normal.  You're both right.  The only way the culture changes is with more people choosing bakeries, which will gradually reduce the price. \n\nInterestingly, butchers tend to have similar pricing to supermarkets, but they have better quality.  I think the difference in the product matters there.  But, butchers usually also have premium options (aged, specialty, etc.).Even then, the zoning laws that keep stores way from residential areas are also mostly an American cultural problem (though some European countries like Portugal also decided to replicate the idiotic concept). I currently have 4 grocery stores within (a 10 minutes) walking distance from my apartment.I\u2019ll make the occasional ciabatta loaf if I\u2019m feeling inspired on a weekend but it\u2019s definitely something I don\u2019t have a ton of time for.[removed]Yes, that is literally the definition of processing. Think about what a food processor does.Yeah his comment is entirely misleading. Once you read that it isn\u2019t bad at all.[removed][removed]What's your point? Processing doesn't make something unhealthy, not inherently.[removed][removed]Go aggiesAggie here, represent!Monoculture was a problem long before GMOsI've only met one person who wanted to debate on GMOs and had an issue with monoculture, and that was online. Every person I've met in real life that hated GMOs or was crazy about organic stuff basically had no idea what they were talking about (and most seemed very similar to antivaxxers).Availability is an issue. But so is ubiquity. It's hard to find things NOT loaded with sugar without a pretty dedicated effort that makes you feel like you're on a \"special diet.\"It\u2019s only half as energy dense as fat is. But then we love fatty foods too.The very real problem if we're going to go that rout is the lack of exercise. We used to be able to eat big meals when we lived like the Amish. We needed that energy. Now we're eating more calories and exercising less. That's a deadly combo.Cents over sense?Sugar and inactivity together are bad for health and insulin sensitivity/diabetes. \n\nThe root of the problem is arguably inactivity and sitting for many hours of a time. Or more broadly, if one has a sedentary lifestyle, that carries risk factors and dietary choices should take that into account.\n\nThere's a group of African world record runners who have a diet in which 60 percent of their calories from sugar, fun fact.Do they eat a lot of sugar on average, or just in bursts while their average consumption is lower?The entire reason you have saturated and hydrogenated fats is shelf stability. If you use unsaturated your product goes rancid in a fraction of the time and may have an undesirably softer texture.My great great gran lived to 105 eating mostly food produced on the farm, but their biggest source of fat came from bacon grease, which was used to Season a ton of what they ate.  To this day my mom keeps a can of bacon grease by the stove, and she\u2019ll be 88 this year.  Blood pressure and heart are fine.\n\nMeanwhile, my gym going husband, who eats mostly lean meats and veggies cooked with olive oil, is pre-diabetic.  He lost weight and lowered his numbers by cutting soda and bread almost entirely, occasionally eats brown rice or some pasta, but it seems years of eating a ton of sugar is the real issue.Ah yes then we run continual drought and ruin the land because both of those fats are unsustainable at the current demand.Every product with a nutritional label has to follow RACC, a \"Reference Amount Customarily Consumed.\" These are mostly set by the FDA, or in some cases if a company has a very unique product, it has to have evidence that the given amount is typically what is eaten in one sitting. \n\nUnder the Obama administration's FDA label reform, RACCs were all updated and expanded, and any product that has 2 or fewer RACC servings (eg. a 20oz bottle of soda has 1.67 12oz servings) must be labeled at the whole package level. \n\nCompanies have played games with serving sizes in the past, but those days are basically gone. \n\nRounding rules are a whole different kettle of fish, but generally speaking, if you can round down to 0 the amount of the nutritional is going to be totally negligible.I think people would be a lot less afraid of the food industry if there was just more information out there and easily-accessible. *What* do you do to the frozen breaded chicken patties at Walmart and *why*? People get skeptical about food if it isn't intuitively obvious what it is and where it came from, and I don't necessarily blame them.I mean, the food processing conditions were appalling, though, and we're all better off for that being improved.[removed][removed]Muscle cramps suckWait, does Whole Foods not have salt or something? (I've never shopped at one)[removed][removed]Also the lack of exercise.[removed]Yeah this is mostly BS. People say stabilizers and preservatives like that is a bad thing. Where would the modern food supply be without those things? We all knew the high sugar intake was bad for us, this is nothing new.\n\nPeople hear the names of the ingredients and think its bad for them or call them \"chemicals\" because they dont understand what they are or the purpose. You might see 'sodium hydrogen carbonate' and think I do not want those chemicals in my food but sodium hydrogen carbonate is baking soda.It is also good for the environment.Actually there have been studies that show that emulsifiers and stabilisers can significantly harm our intestines. They work by dissolving the mucus, leading to damage to the membranes and the gut biota. After I read the study I do everything I can to avoid them.Not saying it\u2019s bad, pickles have tons of health benefits, but op I think was looking for non processed goods that last a long time.It's somewhat common in rural areas, where it's likely a lot closer to you and/or cheaper than the nearest \"real\" grocery store.  I don't think I've ever known anyone to use it as their only grocery store, more of a place to grab a few basics if they're running low.  I'm sure some people do use it that way though.I'm just out here trying to find my (meal) prep or die.What if you plan on eating not a whole loaf of bread in one day?\n\nIt should take you three days to eat a loaf of bread, but lo and behold it\u2019s stale by the end of that.Personally I prefer smoking my bread and leaving it in a salt barrel for the winterPickled bread is technically beer.Besides maybe some ethnic shops, all the independent butchers I\u2019ve ever seen around me are boutique and considerably more expensive than the supermarket.One bread I frequently make you technically need a cast iron pot but hands on time is 10 minutes and is excellent and crusty. Look up New York times no knead bread. So good.[removed]It's only misleading because of biases against processed food. What he wrote is actually just a fact without interpretation or editorialization.That was my pointInteresting comparison! It\u2019s very strange how much GMOs are vilified and \u201corganic\u201d is praised with such little research. Especially when you consider it from that angle of the google scholars who think they know oh so much. Just 5 minutes of online study could open someone\u2019s eyes to just how wrong they often are about both.Same experience here. \n\nOften they don't even know why they buy stuff with a big green \"bio\" sticker. They just assume that it's better. \n\nAnd GMOs are unnatural and therefore bad. \n\nThere are issues with them but they should be managed via proper regulation and oversight, not outright banned.It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s the exact opposite for me. All the people I meet dgaf about gmos except those who are concerned about the environmental impact and concern about round-up ready products increasing their food exposure to round-up. They\u2019re also concerned about industrial organic production because it\u2019s very hard on the environment.It's hard to avoid sugary snacks. Pay attention the next time you go out, they're everywhere and positioned in stores to be specifically where you can't avoid them.Dude, this.\n\nI cut out ALL added sugars and artificial sweeteners for over a year. It was the most restrictive thing I've ever done and remains a task I don't want to do againI mean, if you just buy your snacks from the produce section...\n\nNot to sound all holier-than-thou. I'm overweight from eating carbs all the time, but my brother lost 115 lbs. in less than a year by just eating raw fruit and vegetables constantly and having baked, skinless chicken breast for dinner every night along side them.I mean, here in Korea, like 90% of our food is cooked from vegetables we buy fresh at the market like 5 minutes walking from our homes... it's easy.[deleted]Eeeeh. It's just most of what you want has sugar and you want it because it has sugarFats aren't quite so bad for you though. The problem isn't just the caloric value, it's satiety and tooth decay and diabetes and all that other stuff.Sugar is fine if you count calories, eating 4000 kcal diets and siting all day will make you fat real fast tho.Suppose it depends on what you mean by a lot\n\nBut at the end of the day its calories in vs calories out\n\nWould be interested in seeing the effects of sugar when weight is controlled for (my guess is it's not bad for you, your body will break down any carbs into glucose)The point is to eat more natural products in the first place. Shelf stable for longer doesn\u2019t necessarily make the product better for anyone to eat. It just prevents it from spoiling faster as you pointed out.That's not a large enough sample size to draw any meaningful conclusions. Maybe you're correct, but it could just as easily be the case that your family genetics are highly resistant to heart disease, and your husband is particularly prone to diabetes.That is totally correct. People get weirded out about stuff, but once they learn what it really is.... \u201cOh, is THAT all?\u201d[removed][removed][removed][removed]Potassium my dawg, it's why bananas are so popular with athletes.I don't know why they capitalized \"whole foods\" like that; they're not referring to the grocery store, but rather they're referring to whole food (minimally processed food) as opposed to processed food.Can you refer the study? Thanks in advanceWhat I do myself : I cut the bread in 3 pieces of roughly the same size (I buy baguettes, I'm French). Each piece last me one meal (usually), so I freeze everything except one for the next meal.\n\nYou can buy fresh bread and freeze what you don't eat right away.Fermenting and pickling are different processes.[removed]It\u2019s because in the US, they showed \u201cFood, Inc\u201d in school.\n\nIt was straight up propraganda against GMO.Soda and juices loaded with sugar are the big problem, it's way easier to drink 3000 calories than to eat them. \n\nSwitching to only unsweetened tea and pure water has improved my health so much.It's not just the junk food snacks. Check out the sugar content on major brands of spaghetti sauce or even bread. Corn syrup is in *everything.*[deleted]I once heard that you'll likely eat healthier if you shop the perimeter of the grocery store, avoiding the central aisles as much as possible. For my area, it's true. The produce, raw meat, seafood, dairy, and eggs (also sometimes the fancier, in-store bakery items) are around the perimeter, with the more processed foods in the middle aisles.I eat as close to zero carbs as I can, and working in an office makes it so much more difficult. Everything in the vending machine is nothing but carbs, every day there are donuts or bagels, every meeting where there is lunch provided is like 90% sugar and starch and then people look at me weird when I brown bag it every timeIts not just snacks, its everything. Try buying bacon that doesn\u2019t include added sugar, its impossible.He probably reduced his caloric intake drastically, which means pointing to produce as the cause of the weight loss isn\u2019t accurate imo.\n\nI ate sandwiches and boxes meals (carbs sodium and fat) and I lost weight. Not because of the sandwiches or boxed meals but the reduced calories due to eating lessmaking your own damn chocolate chip cookies at home from flour, eggs, chocolate chips, butter, and sugar as opposed to buying Pillsbury dough isn't exactly buying your snacks from the produce section...Not necessarily. Go try to buy a loaf of bread without any added sugar in it (this includes honey and molasses). It\u2019s nearly impossible at a regular grocery store. If you\u2019re lucky the bakery section will maybe have a sourdough loaf or something. Even at specialty stores like Whole Foods, your options aren\u2019t great. Bread isn\u2019t really sweet, but good luck finding any without sugar.I\u2019ve worked most of my career in the food industry, and have heard the saying \u201cshelf life is money\u201d many times from many different people.\n\nThat\u2019s how you end up with processed meat products that have 120 day shelf life.[removed][removed][removed]Muscle cramps are very very commonly linked to sodium deficiency as wellAthletes also drink pickle juice.Got it thanks! I feel like a dummy.Autocorrect, I'm guessing.Yeah sorry,  apparently, it auto corrected to the grocery store.Eating a third of a baguette per meal sounds like a lot of breadFermentation is a part of the pickling process. But you would get a very salty beer.Do they really? What the hell. I\u2019m from the US, but my high school years were complete a decade before that film was even made. Understanding the food we\u2019re eating is a good thing to be sure, but how do you show a documentary like that in school without having a subsequent conversation about the rights and wrongs of the food industry? You can\u2019t black and white GMOs. There\u2019s so much more to it than that.[deleted]\\>  Soda and juices loaded with sugar\n\nOne important step is to stop calling \"fruit extract concentrate plus sugar and water\" juice. Only call juice juice. It's a completely different thing.\n\nIn Australia we have this crazy communist socialist law: you can't completely lie that the drink you are selling is juice if it's not.It's completely insane, it's literally a filler in almost every imaginable food. It's like, how can we make this food product to basically have as little of the actual thing in it that it's supposed to be made of, and as much cheap corn-derived starch/sugar as possible. THAT ISN'T FOOD!! No wonder the West has a massive weight/health crisis.My HEB usually puts the big bags (idk the weight but the $3 bag) on 2/$3 at least once a month.\n\nSo I'm pretty guilty of buying and eating a lot of m&ms. Especially since they brought the crispy ones back.I've noticed this too! At my grocery store's candy aisle, they replaced regular-sized, relatively unique candy bars (whatchamacallit, Charleston chew, etc) with huge bags of skittles, sour patch kids, huge candy bars whose regular size they sell at the checkout and huge bags of miniature size candy bars. It's obscene.Can\u2019t you ask the admin to get you something that makes sense for your dietary preferences?You made me get up and check my bacon.\n\n0 carbohydrates \n\nTyson brandTo be fair, bacon is a cured product. It's processed and that process generally involves some sugar. Buy uncured pork belly. Have it sliced if you want. Cure it yourself, if you'd like.Bacon is typically cured with mollasus or some other type of sugar.. that's literally the process.  \n\n\nI buy pork belly,  brine,  cure/smoke  my own.. sugar is required as part of the process for anything that tastes like what your brain thinks bacon is.That's a good point, but it is much easier to do with all those vegetables. They keep you full, and your body will break down the sugar in all those carrots more slowly over time, so you don't suddenly drop in blood sugar and feel like you need food even when you aren't really hungry.\n\nThe other things he did were mainly related to staying busy and having a routine. Once food became fuel for him instead of something fun to do he started dropping off pounds.Eating fresh produce and reducing calories goes hand-in-hand. Eating protein-dense and fiber-heavy food makes you feel much more full for less calories. Greens like spinach and broccoli are particularly good for this. In effect, their brother did drastically reduce his calorie intake by just eating way more veggies, which reduced any craving for potato chips and chocolate cake.This is such an annoying comment because it completely neglects why the eating that diet works. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to eat less calories if you eat whole foods becuse they are more filling and less calorie dense than the typical American diet \n\nSure, you could only eat twinkies for a month and lose weight if you stay below your caliore threshold, but  it would probably be a pretty miserable way to live.I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who has this problem.Not exactly better, no, but learning that it takes effort to create those things gives you a healthy respect for how much of it you should consume.  \n\nIt\u2019s a lot easier to eat 12 cookies when you can just pickup a package off the shelf, then when it takes you two hours to mix, portion, and bake handmade cookies.It wasn\u2019t until i move to the UK did I notice this fact the. Upon coming back I my taste buds were changed and most of my favorite foods just didn\u2019t taste that good to me.Yeast usually needs a source of sugar to eat to create the carbon dioxide used to leaven most breads. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficulty make bread without sugar, honey, agave nectar, molasses or some kind of sweetener. Bread made without with takes too long to get a good rise, or doesn\u2019t get a good rise. It isn\u2019t feasible for the amount of demand.Eh, most richer yeast recipes include some sugar even if you make the bread by hand the old fashioned way.  French bread and sourdough don't need it, but \"sandwich\" bread, challah, bagels, brioche, they all have it.\n\nEnd of the day, it's carbs.It's no coincidence sodium and potassium are in the same column on the periodic table.nope, valid question, I also was sure they meant the store until you asked.And Amazon doesn't even own a phone os!The flavoured sparkling waters are my current favourite. No calories, sweeteners, etc.Congratulations on the weight loss!Even real juice isn't a great idea for a drink. You're not getting the fibre from the fruit that makes you feel full, just the flavour and sugar. \n\nDrinking the juice of 6 apples (a decent size glass worth) - it's easy, and you're still hungry. Eating 6 apples - well you wouldn't, would you?Even true juice is problematic, because it's still very sugar dense, and the juicing process itself eliminates a lot of the fiber that you'd get if you chose to eat the fruit instead. Even for a particularly juicy fruit, like an orange, you need a 2-4 oranges to get 250 mL of orange juice. You wouldn't eat that many oranges in one sitting (most likely), but you could definitely drink that much orange juice with a single meal.[deleted]The really fucked up part is in the US you can label things as \"made with 100% juice.\"\n\nThe labeling is used to make unaware consumers think the product is 100% juice. What it means is the juice used - even if it's 1% of the finished product - was unadulterated prior to it being used as an ingredient.Naturally infused seltzer water is the way out of that all too easy grab a soda when thirsty and get rewarded with a dopamine hit habit.Pretty sure Naked got sued for this here in the U.S. and lost. Multiple times.That's not just an Australian thing.I've made my fair share of bacon starting with pork belly.  I've yet to make one without sugar involved that tasted like bacon.Yep spinach takes up a lot of space and takes longer to break down than starch does.I baked some really good sugar cookies last month and I made 6 of them last like 4 days (gave away the other 6). But if I buy a cookie tub from the supermarket bakery I eat like 6 at a damn time.I can make 2 dozen drop cookies (think things you drop on a cookie sheet eg chocolate chip) in 30 minutes or so.  Who takes two hours?  The only things that take that long are log/icebox cookies or peanut butter cookies.This is why I almost never eat Alfredo sauce anymore. I couldn't believe how much cream, cheese and butter I was dumping in when I made it at home one time.when you get used to eating food outside the us and then come back *everything* is so sweet that you wonder how you liked it in the first placeUS store bread tastes closer to EU cake than real bread.My son said the same after a couple of weeks in the U.K.  He said the food just seemed fresher.I\u2019ve worked in a mass production bakery (150ish loafs a minute). While what you say is technically correct, the amount of sugar added is multitudes more then what the yeast need for food.The problem is that \"some\" sugar is fine, but we have cranked the dial up so high that now everything has a mountain of sugar in it, and then people start knee jerk reacting against small, reasonable amounts of it.\n\nIt's like, why can't we just make things a bit less sweet rather than replacing sugar with fake sugars and continually ramping it up.\n\nIt's almost to the point for me where everything is so sweet all the time that I don't even really know what sweet tastes like anymore because it's all the same.Yeast leavens a dough made from just wheat flour, water, and salt perfectly quickly on its own. All the simple carbs the yeast needs are in the flour.\n\nHeavier doughs like rye and whole grain might need some added sugar.American bread is so much sweeter than european bread of the same type. It's feasible, it's just that sugar and high fructose corn syrup are addictive and addiction means better sales for your brand.People have been making bread with naturally fermented sourdough starter (no sugar) for hundreds of years.  The reason we get artificially leavened, nutritionally void loaves of \"bread\" at the supermarket is because companies are greedy and will always chose profit over health.I make our family bread. We use flour, water, salt and yeast 99% of the time. The only time I use a an enriched dough that has sugar is for a special occasion bread. You really don\u2019t need sugar.Challah and brioche are specialty breads, more for desert/celebration. The problem is the table bread. The stuff you use for toast, sandwiches and so forth.\n\nIndustrial white bread is quite high in sugar compared to more traditional breads. 1~2 tsp of sugar per loaf in normal bread is a lot different from 1/2 cup in challah or 1/3cup in wonderbread!\n\nEdit: Honestly though, unless you're eating a loaf a day, this probably isn't a major weight concern. If you have 2 slices a day you're talking a mere 15 or so calories extra a day from the sweetened bread. That isn't nothing... but a can of coke is 150 cals + and many Americans have 5~10 a week. A donut is 200~400 cals. A beer is 250~300cals. If you don't have any of these 3 things you're probably not overweight.",

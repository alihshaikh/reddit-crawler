Got it.This kills grandma.Fuckin idiots. I mean...goddamn how fucking stupid are these people? Jesus Christ.Nice. Making laws based on nothing in order to reinforce misinformation and spread conspiracy theories.\n\nVery nice.Do they realize the flu shot every year is different?It just amazes me that these people believe that they know better than the FDA and healthcare professionals. The fact that people continue to vote them into office is terrifying.We seem to have lost our minds!These guys look like the most country backwoods inbred jackasses I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026 and I live Alabama!Jesus Christ. \n\nThey are like vindictive children. Cutting off your head to spite your face.Does this mean they will prosecute those that leave the state for vaccinations?   Do we need a vaccination underground railroad?Next up: no new laws for 3 yearsAt least we know where the H5N1 origin point will be now.Been great to see the future of NC change so fast. I thought I'd be OK here and I am loathe to move with so much of my roots being planted here family etc but dammit. What an embarrassmentI\u2019m white knuckling the steering wheel of my life watching avian influenza creep closer and closer to human-to-human transmissibility, I think it\u2019s safe to say that such a scenario would be akin to nuking the entire state of North Carolina if this bill went throughWell, that's one way to control the population.How the fuck does a man with that haircut get elected? To make decisions??So apparently they're in the pocket of Big Polio, Big Tetanus and The Industrial Flu Complex.Well this is just dumb and short sighted.\n\nAm I surprised, no.You know, it's sad that you can identify a Republican-sponsored bill just by how fucking stupid it sounds.North Carolina is currently home of the research triangle.  If North Carolina starts passing anti-science laws, the governors of Minnesota, Michigan, and Washington will be trying to woo some of those companies. \n\nWon\u2019t take much: Want to be able to save your kids in the next pandemic? Here\u2019s some tax credits. Start packing.So what im hearing from the ~~Nazi party~~ lately is that it's NOT about personal freedoms? It's about forcing your beliefs on others? Weird.. I almost could have sworn I had heard this before... somewhereUnintended consequences?\nOh fuck yeah, there will be.Can we make it illegal for politicians to make our healthcare decisions?So a disease comes out that kills 5 percent of the population and then... what?\n\nWhat? Nothing? We made a law where 5 percent die... on purpose? These people are out of their fucking mindsRepublicans sure love to harm the American people.That dude is a genius. He somehow talked his barber into giving him the Moe *and* the Curly.Jesus H. Christ, stop voting for fucking RepublicansThat includes the MRNA vaccines that will be coming out for cancer and heart disease.\nWealthy Republicans will just fly to Hawaii for a Vacation and Vaccination (V&V)This ain't passing, too many GOP politicians want to live lmaoMy state, North Carolina, is drift more and more to the south... It's a shame.If you get a bowl cut at the age of 60 or more, it's time to retire cuz u lost yo damn mindWhy is it that the most idiotic, amoral, and sexually deviant elected or appointed officials are always Republican?Enjoy your measles epidemic.The stunning stupidity is eye opening.Make Americans Sick Again!So if the bird flu swoops in they are ok with a 54% mortality rate?Great! So long as we can restrict their right to travel so they don\u2019t infect the rest of us. Better yet, let\u2019s build a wall around them!This goes beyond making NC less able to fend off new diseases.  There are current trials of cancer vaccines and Parkinson vaccines.  In fact mRNA has revolutionized vaccine development.  This is just sad.The appears to be a reality hitting the Red States, excessive  death and Insurance actuaries. Those statistics are  a grim reality of their response to covid. Now like any good Republican you double down and perpetuate your screw up! Vaccines and CDC are bad.\n\nThe contrast of Blue to Red covid outcomes are too startling. Unfortunately the Red States are buying into a malaise we will own for years to come. Covid is the first.Banning toothbrushes nextTheir hair tho. My goodness\u2026I mean, going off of historical trends, the next apocalyptic disease shouldn\u2019t ravage the earth until ~2120 when the dissenters have long past integrated\u2026 so I think they should be fine in the long run.Let's kill everyone! Woohoo.\n\nThat science has been so awesome at ending/reducing so much early death and harm from smallpox, polio, etc. has really given these people brainworms.\n\nImagine 3 years of no vaccines for COVID. And they are OK with 3X dead. :/ \"Let's kill even more of our voter base, Pinky!\"\n\n\"Great idea, Brain! Let's do it!\"I've been saying for a long time that republicans have gone looney, and it seems to be getting worse. They want to ban books. Ban history. Ban abortion. And contraceptives are next. Ban trans people. Ban school lunches. Cut medicare and SS. Ban electric cars. Now they want to ban vaccines. Republicans are a danger to America.r/justfuckmyshitupNot clear. Any type of vaccination aside from covid?There would be so many dead childrenIs this the type of law like when Florida banned sex?I can't believe the toleration of wanton stupidity.These guys need to be on fuckmyshitupThere are a number of very promising MRNA vaccines for cancer \u2014 you bet I'll be in line for whatever I qualify for!\n\nSource for people interested in real research at the Lancet: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(22)00372-2/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(22)00372-2/fulltext)\n\nIt's too bad that the Republicans are so insistent on killing their base. Current data show the average age of death in Republican areas is 66 \u2014 compared to 86 in Democrat areas. \n\nSource: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/129p8tm/life\\_expectancy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/129p8tm/life_expectancy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)What kind of EFFING IDIOTS ARE THESE \u201cPEOPLE\u201d??????????Kill off your voting base.  Great strategy.Just a reminder there are rules in this sub against wishing harm on others.Killing off the voting base to own the libzHave fun with the flu then. That\u2019s a new vaccine every year.Because politicians know more than doctors.This is what you get from a super majorityThis is a great plan if your goal is to sell more tiny coffinsYou have to give them credit for consistently.  Take any issue and they'll find the wrong side of it and plant their flag there, proudly.  \n\nPeople:  Hey GOP, what about disease?  For or against?\n\nGOP:  We oppose vaccination!  Disease is natural!\n\nPeople:  Wow. Ok, I should have expected that.Freedom lol!Isn't it my personal freedom to get a vaccine if I want to?Just wait until a virus comes around that kills in days - millions of Darwin awards to be handed out.Imagine letting mfers with THOSE haircuts have any authority ever. I wouldn\u2019t let them run a shift at Domino\u2019s!Thank goodness these yahoos and social media weren\u2019t around when the \u201cunproven\u201d polio vaccine was implemented and saved countless children from death or a lifetime of suffering.so i just want to make sure i understand this- we're talking no flu shots, right? like nothing? (unless you have access to a military base cuz military base.)\n\nokay...well...i think people can take NC off their list of potential states to retire too.\n\nthough maybe that was the goal. (though this could make property less expensive?)Damn Ralph Wiggum is a member of the NC house.I wish some of these politicians had my previous neighbor.   This guy was was a dick!! Effective.   But a dick!Yet another bevy of uneducated, untrained GOP cult members who believe their insight into epidemiology and virology surpasses that of those who've actually spent their lives reading, studying, learning, discussing and testing in their field.\n\nDunning-Kruger run amok.Gotta love the keep government out of your private lives party\u2026That state probably does need to thin out it\u2019s population of extremist. This will help.I\u2019m really glad my friend who lives there is moving back to New England soon.And remember that these are the dickbags who outlawed \u201cparticipation trophys\u201d for kids a few weeks ago.  Can\u2019t wait to see what they\u2019re at work on for the future!Whelp. Sounds like he just volunteered the entire population of NC to be the control group when the next pandemic hits.so no vaccinations at all? like for newborn? 1 year? 3 years old? i mean that shit i wild thanArrogant ignorance.Does this apply to animals too?Seems like a bad....or good...time for Marburg or some nasty avian flu to show up.So, we'll have to leave the state to get vaccinations AND abortions before too long?My god, who cut the guy on the right\u2019s hair!So if there\u2019s a sci fi style outbreak like airborne Ebola will other states quarantine people fleeing to get the vaccine or will it be a death sentence where you are trapped?Looking forward to the return of smallpoxMan we all thought NC would be the next VA to turn purple then blue. Alot tech jobs in raleigh and durham. I was even thinking about a move. Big yikesI think that\u2019s great. When we get a universal flu vaccine, cancer \u201cvaccine\u201d, and an actual HIV vaccine, we can sit back and watch the hilarity in the state. \n\nI\u2019m done trying to get these asses to understand. It is, literally, intentional ignorance.Give these asshats the Darwin Award. Bring back diseases that will decimate the population and spill over into other States and countries.Omg the hairNext weeks headline: Republican house passes Oreo ban. \u201cSending the wrong message on interracial relations.\u201dwhat do these people want to test nature?Just the haircuts alone tell me these guys  are fucking moronsNice haircut.So the GOP\u2019s strategy is\u2026 bring back measles and polio?These people are dangerously stupid. Why do we have to let them have a say in government?Pretty dope that haircut on the right gets to make laws\u2026 super cool and good country we got here.It's the insur(r)ectionist party, they ban healthcare for americans and probably intend to maximize pandemic fatalities because of their extremist far right ideology. Partly because of their nazi Nietzsche \"only the strong survive\" outright neonazi bullshit. Which is why they love sacrificing grandma if you listen to insu(r)rrectionists politicians in E.G/ crazy red state Texas : https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/24/covid-19-texas-official-suggests-elderly-willing-die-economy/2905990001/\n\nThey were already like that with coronavirus, doing everything they could to prevent vaccinations, masks, basic clean ups etc, because they are malicious and wrongly decided it could only affect political opponents, liberals, dems and so on. \n\nYes, republican insurectionist propaganda falsely declares that only liberals can fall sick and that \"conservatives tough it up\" while in reality of course they die in droves from untreated pandemics. Because humans + sickness = risk of death.\n\nJust like with so called \"grid virus\" (which is the aid virus the republicans renamed to pretend it only affected liberals and gays. In reality of course it wiped 10% of the red state population in the years after reagan because they artificially denied healthcare over this.).\n\nAnd of course the insur(r)ectionists party have an habit of orchestrating persecution campaigns against medical doctors contradicting their open and systematic lies and propaganda campaigns (re Fauci, their bribe payments to FL's surgeon general to push lies on numbers, etc).\n\nEdit and if people are unhappy about this then maybe they should take it to their insur(r)ectionist representatives, because this is the batshit (R) party that just banned by law vaccinations in a (R) maga state as their batshit dogwhistling desantis signaling, which in reality will only maximize fatalities in their state esp with die hard republican MAGAhedeen insurrectionist supporters at the next flu season in say 8 months. \n\nBecause the smarter blue voters won't eat [iver sheep drench](https://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410liS0QG9L.jpg) (toxic for humans, especially at those doses) like the insurrectionist republicans since they know better than thinking they are litteral whooly sheep; and will likely simply get vaccinated out of that banana republic and leave it.Republicans know if you are poor, uneducated, and scared, you are more likely to vote for despots. It is a strategy as old as voting.\n\nProblem is, people still fall for it.Not at all surprising from the party that went from [\"Obama wants to pull the plug on Grandma\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel) to [\"Old people should be willing to die for the economy.\"](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-suggests-he-other-seniors-willing-n1167341)And many many more conservative voters. Oh no. Don't do it. Stop. No.\n\nOh well, nothing could be done to prevent it.Nana is a drain on our country!!1!1this is about child vaccine schedules and new vaccines.  I am not for it.  These idiots think politicians should be making decisions on vaccines and medications which is idiotic.  Yet it is not about adult vaccines.But it cuts social securityEvery time I\u2019ve thought they hit bottom I find out there is no bottom!!It\u2019s the reason they keep cutting education. The more brain dead kids are they more voters they\u2019ll have.Just wait until there's a virus that causes permanent visible scarring, and it attacks the face for some reason.What else are republicans supposed to do? They believe they cannot win elections if they run on their policiesBut if it wasn't an issue then why would they be making a law about it?!?? \n\n/s\n\nThat's why they want to do. To give people a talking point.I guess realizing isn\u2019t their strong suit.Their platform is nonexistent and is just based on disagreeing with democrats. The democrats and experts said we need vaccines. That means the republicans just gained a new thing to oppose.These guys even thought they knew more than their barber!Speak for yourself.While cutting down their own voters to own the libs. \"That'll learn 'em - oh dang, we're like the Green party now.\"No, just a free bus ride to Virginia Or no new elections.\n\n\"We've got everything exactly right- cant risk messing it up\"Dude. That shit is *scary*. \n\nIt's funny that I think a 55% mortality rate (with medical intervention!?!) would be impossible to ignore, but I just have this image of a plague rat shopping for musinex at the right aide.......[deleted]Serious question here, what\u2019s the straw to break the camels back for you? Do you pull the trigger and move to another state? Do you move out of country and start new? I don\u2019t envy your position and would be really frustrated as you have stated. I just don\u2019t know what you do in this situation. That all being said refugees and ex pats have made it work and started fulfilling new lives before. Whatever you do I wish you luck and stay safe.You know, that almost happemed once?Thank you!!! I came here to direct people\u2019s attention to the haircut on the right\u2026. And could NOT believe the first mention of it was this far down in the comments.\nTake my updoot !The IFC killed my motherHave then come to Minnesota. Well put their labs next to the Mayo Clinic. There, you have one of the best hospitals in the world and the best doctors. Put your lab there and the research will be phenomenal.I'm worried we are going to lose them as a result of the house bill denying tenure in the unc system schools. Uni's can't teach actual science and history, brain drain starts and goodbye businesses that depend on the educated workforce \n\nWe are so close to a grim future in NC, for a state that has more registered Dems than republicans we are the poster child for gerrymanderingNah, they'll just cross the border to a blue state and get theirs. It won't be the elite that suffers.Because the GOP intelligently equates vaccines with living?!? Did you miss their reaction to the covid epidemic and vaccinations, lol?North Carolina isn't a red state its  purple state that is gerrymandered to hell. The state is almost an equal proportion of D, and R with an almost equal amount of left and right leaning I's.\n\nIt's also not like Texas where people don't vote. It's literally bullshit that has caused this.Avian flu has a 53% death rate in humans at the moment. Fortunately, there haven't been a lot of cases to date \u2014 the virus needs a few more evolutions to be effective in humans.North Carolina dad to child, you don't want to be a doctor here you want to be a mortician.The regular scheduled vaccines will still be dealt out to the children. This bill just keeps from adding any new vaccines to the required list unless approved by a 10 chair panel. Bottom line, they are pandering to the MAGA base and affiliates.The guy on the leftI agree w a lot of this except Nietzsche [wasn\u2019t a nazi](https://amp.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/06/exploding-nietzsche-myths-need-dynamiting). And it\u2019s a bummer he can\u2019t be valued due to these pieces of shit. Wagner too. \n\nIt is unfortunate is that our current versions of Nazis in the US do believe in god. I think through the power of belief they could do more damage.Nietzsche would be furious with what the Nazis have done to his ideology. At least he got to die before he saw his life's work perverted by people he hated.It\u2019s always projection.Like a mobius strip of stupidWell with this it will just be dead kids\u2026 and elderly\u2026. And sickly\u2026. and just allot of normal folks.\"If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism. They will reject democracy,\"\n\n...*David Frum*I've long ago simply started calling the GOP the Contrarian Party.   Pretty much since they created health care mandates, the Dem's adopted them, and they the GOP decided to be against it.\"This dirty commie thinks you should never, ever walk in front of busses.  Not getting hit by busses is so *woke*...\"Republicans are just so nasty and unintelligent.Hate to say this, but my money is on this. Just banning future elections, or giving themselves the right to delay future elections indefinitelyIts not human to human transmitted (yet) so there is no need to panic for now. If it does happen it will be very, very evident.Might want to check your facts on that budHonestly I don't know. I tend to get very strong gut feelings though and historically acting on them tends to lead me to a good outcome so I am just waiting and listening to my \"intuition\" so to speak. It's difficult because the states I think I'd feel the happiest living in are also states that the climate crisis is not going to be kind to. I just am taking things as they come and trying to stay on top of things. I have a close friend in academia and she regularly sends me up to date climate research from her colleagues or whatever she learned from sitting in on a class that day. \n\nI am safer than most -- I am in a straight passing marriage, I look stereotypically feminine, and I actually had my uterus happily evicted in 2022. I am aware that this confers me a lot of protection. \n\nMy mom said once she retires if we decide to move, she will just follow us. But we will see. I'll be honest if China's government wasn't such a shit show, she would strongly consider going back to Guilin and I'd probably plan on going there too. Language barrier aside I absolutely love being there and I thrive in a place like that. Lots to do, car is unnecessary, but still laid back, relaxed and old timey with lots of nature. The closest I have to that without leaving the USA that I've found in my travels is Honolulu :/ I do also like the significant presence of Asian culture and businesses in Vegas but the car dependency is annoying. My husband has toyed with the idea of the outskirts of Seattle as well. \n\nThere is no easy answer. But I remain flexible and open to options and I think when the time comes that I feel a conviction to bounce out of here, we will know where we want to go.Unfortunately I\u2019m very aware. My masters that I\u2019m currently working on focuses on emerging infectious diseases and I\u2019m of the opinion that an avian influenza pandemic is more of a matter of when it happens as opposed to if it\u2019ll happenI am so sorry for your pain and los.The top level people knew the lies were for the morons. You can tell because while all the top level politicians and national hate mongers got the vaccine, the local level shit heels didn't do the same.I send hugs.\n\nyeah...that's useless.>It is unfortunate is that our current versions of Nazis in the US do believe in god. I think through the power of belief they could do more damage.\n\nI think their belief in fairy tales sets them up to be credulous rubes.I could not agree more.   I don\u2019t consider myself among them and therefore not a part of \u201cwe\u201d.  Downvote me if you must. The republicans have lost their minds.  Mine is sound.That's not the route republicans are going. What they are going for is to give the gemandered state legislatures the authority to overturn the results of any election they don't like the results of for any reason.It feels like the end game - Trump was a teail blazer for them and showed that all you have to do to topple democracy is have patience and not be totally inept.If not that, then something else is almost guaranteed. It's just a matter of time they way we do things now.Don't worry, they're working on it.Well it seems you have put allot of thought into this. If it helps I live in the Vancouver area of BC Canada, been down to Seattle quite a bit and while we do get our fair share of rain, the summers are great and the culture in both cities is diverse and friendly. Very happy here on the north west? Coast. Though I\u2019m just a internet stranger you have my best wishes and I hope everything works out for you!No, no.  The other part.  [North Carolina almost got nuked,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Goldsboro_B-52_crash) back in the \u201860s.I think Joloven was referring to two actual nukes that the US Air Force accidentally dropped on North Carolina in 1961.\n\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/nuclear-bombs-dropped-on-north-carolinaYeah smart enough to circumvent the need for vaccines by injecting bleach. Supreme mental giants one and all!Hopefully its something with a low mortality rate again... Last thing I need is societal breakdown and roaming gangs.It\u2019s almost impressive now how I can\u2019t go 24 hours without learning one more way that we came seconds away from annihilation",

And yes, that one too.Trans people all over the country feel as though the taliban is taking overParty of small government wants to pull up your dress or pull down your pants, inspect your genitals and then tell you exactly how to dress.\n\nSame toddlers, writhe on the ground, pounding fists and cry when called fascist.Isn\u2019t a trans Missourian just someone that lives in Arkansas but identifies as a resident of Missouri? /sGet Out\nNowNot letting a kid take hormone pills is very different than living with the taliban I suggest you look closely at Afghanistan and check your privilege. They throw acid in a girls face for going to school, we\u2019re talking about hormone blockers it\u2019s not the same thing. Not every medicine is appropriate for gender disorders, ask yourself why they\u2019re banned in so many countries that are quite liberal otherwise.I think this is part of their plan. Make Red States so inhospitable to Democrats that they leave and the State is forever a Red State leeching off of Blue State prosperity.As a trans person, all of these laws and restrictions taking place have significantly negatively impacted my mental health. I wish I could \"bury my head in the sand\" so to speak and take a break from the news, but it feels like not knowing what is going on is like taking your eyes of the predator that has been stalking you; it might pounce when you're not looking, so it's best to be prepared and know where it is.It\u2019s Christian-Sharia law.\n\nThey\u2019re making everyone live under laws based on their religion.We welcome you in California.I'll give you points for your concerns toward minors but we should let the medical professionals decide what is appropriate and leave the politicians out of it.\n\nAs for the elimination of care for adults; the line stops there. I never recalled ever asking a politician what I could do with myself in terms of self-expression, determination, or what drug I could take.\n\nIt is OUTSIDE of their constrained limitations and to be left to the people to decide for themselves on an individual basis.\n\nI understand this might be new information to you so take some time and critically think it over and come to a rational conclusion. Are you willing to give up your self-determination to your employees? What if they said you could no longer practice your religion? Freedom of speed, determination, and expression is just important as your right to your adult imaginary friend in the sky!This isn't just targeting kids, it's being expanded to adults, at least try to up with your transphobic bullshit.I think you\u2019re right, but it\u2019s hard to stay when you have children, or it affects you directly. I like to say I\u2019d stay, but I don\u2019t know that I would.I'd imagine you're right, that likely is part of the plan.\n\nAnd we'll see how smart they feel when every red state becomes Alabama.Same. You described it perfectly. I know I get sucked in to doom spirals and it's not good for my mental health AT ALL, but I need to know whether it will be illegal for me to use the bathroom tomorrow.\n\nBecause, if so, I'm gonna do it. I'm a trans guy and my tragic backstory won't allow me to use the men's restroom but I'm pretty sure my contrarian-ness could break me out of that.amen brother/sister (i don't want to assume)Then you have standing to sue the FUCK out of these fascist bastards and never have to worry about anything ever again.\n\nYou have an almost 100% chance of winning in the end.\n\nThe government does not get to pick your self-determination or expression.\n\nI only hope you take your new found wealth and use it to push for mandatory felony charges for politicians who submit and pass unconstitutional laws.They are all speed running there.",

Don't fuck with the mouseGive 'em hell Mickey!Think they'll make Ron a castmember when they win control of the state?Even if you support the guy for some reason, is this what you want him spending his time on?THIS COMMENT: \n\n\u201cDisney finds itself in this regrettable position because it expressed a viewpoint the Governor and his allies did not like. Disney wishes that things could have been resolved a different way,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cBut Disney also knows that it is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the State\u2019s retaliation \u2013 a stand smaller businesses and individuals might not be able to take when the State comes after them for expressing their own views. In America, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind.\u201dSlam dunk case. The meatball loses again.Ron DeSantis thinks he's some kind of badass because he had a job in the legal department at Guantanamo Bay.  Meanwhile, Disney successfully sued a child's day care for having paintings of Mickey and Minnie on the wall.  You may be a fascist Ron, but you'll never be as fascist as Disney.Imagine.....Being beaten up by Mickey Mouse!!Big D versus tiny DWell, he woke the dragon, Which may also be on fireFucking finallyThe Mouse > The Mobguess who has better lawyersSCOTUS: Now who do we side with here, business or \"small\" government? ... What's that, it's conservative government? Government wins.Yep. I've heard that the mouse has brutal lawyers my whole life. You don't fuck with that mouse hahaAll very large corporations pride themselves on being very reasonable and polite dragons.  \"It's nothing personal  If this fight involves more than $450,000, your best move is to just give us the money and get on with your life.\n\nYeah, maybe we'll see you in court.  More likely you will get a phone call from a hedge fund operator whose sister works for one of the lawyers we have on retainer.  The hedge fund operator is not a friend of the people who donate Ron's money. He's the money manager of the people who donate Ron's money.  The guy who can say \"We have changed our priorities for strategic reasons, and no longer share your views on this matter.\"As Dopey.That\u2019s the question I have for his supporters. Like, there\u2019s probably a million other productive things he could be spending time on but instead he chose to fuck with Disney because they don\u2019t care for his politics. \n\nWhat kind of weirdo has beef with Mickey Mouse?Rather that than some of his other policiesMany of his supporters believe everything outside of culture wars is perfect about America. Climate change, the aging infrastructure, stagnant wages, etc., it's all made up in their eyes by the \"deep state media.\"Yes because republicans don\u2019t give a shit about bettering society\u2026it\u2019s about attacking perceived imaginary enemiesThe correct question is is this what we want Florida tax dollars spent onLMAO. I actually did laugh out loud.I cannot wait for South Park to cover this...I'm not so sure, corporations are the ones paying the government to do their bidding.Only because goofy is already takenPeople like Dopey; he'll be \"installed\" in \"It's a Small World\".To pwn the libs.....To his supporters and the Fox viewers the \"don't say gay\" thing is a top priority.   This alone is what is ruining America to them and if it isn't stopped America as a civilization will cease to exist.Like that flood damage he may have even returned to Florida to see. I know he was in Ohio, Washington, and Japan very recentlyYeah, but we don't support the guy. 8-)But they're paying government to be controlled by them. So with all the corporatists now in office, giving more power to government is fine for them.No because that would be would insulting to all the dogs out there and they did nothing wrong.So is Dopey.It's a Woke World After AllI think that much cringe so close together might cause a singularity.I get doing stupid shit on occasion to appeal to your base but this\u2026.this is something else entirely lol. I mean, it\u2019s Disney. \n\nWho doesn\u2019t like Disney?Maybe not if the government is daring to tell them what to do, though.I get what you're saying and any normal human being knows this is a waste of taxpayers money. But, you can't reason with GoP supporters as they only care to pwn the libs since they rather blame someone else for their misery than themselves. Misery loves company I hear.....You may be right. I'm just so interested which way this goes. Hopefully SCOTUS just explodes.",

Disney just pulled him and his lackeys into Mickey's arena.\n\nRonron... it's not a good day for you.They have a good caseIts pure first amendment case, unless Desantis want corporations declared non persons?All I can think of is that DeSantis has recognised that Trump supporters think that he is a genius businessman due to his repeated business failures - therefore he wants to be seen as a genius lawyer by having repeated legal failures\u2026I wondered what their next step would be. It will be interesting to see how this plays our.Is Disney able to show actual harm? Wondering about standing.The GOP death kiss of being branded an anti-business republican, who is trying to silence a corporation... No way this turns out well for him.Well, he woke the Dragon, which may also be on fireLike the scene in Bronx Tale. \n\nDoors get locked...\"Now you's can't leave.\"How much tax revenue and salary losses would Florida incur if Disney shut down for a month?\n\nAre there any other states that might like to have Disney set up there?I will testify for Disney....DeSatin has convinced me not to go to or buy anything from or to do with Florida!  Boycott Florida!I would think so. DeSantis is interfering with how they operate - and have operated over the years with state approval.Ahh so maybe they can show costs associated with process changeDon't they just have to show intent? Or maybe that only for a crimeI don't know shit about the law so I don't know if I'm right but i imagine since the case is centered around \"harm to business\" there would be a need to prove a loss in profits or something along those lines",

Sadly, only about .03% will notice they have to pay for DeSantis\u2019s incompetence.Reading dystopian novels did not prepare me to root for megacorps\u2026Hmm\u2026turns out that attacking your state\u2019s biggest tourist industry leader who has some of the best attorneys in the world, isn\u2019t a good idea for your political future.Good. Let Florida and DeSantis answer in a court of law, under oath, their reasoning. \n\nGo for it Disney!While I have my qualms with Disney, I *am* enjoying them teaching DeSantis what it's like to go head-to-head with an entity that has more Fuck You money than he or his wealthy donors can possibly imagine.This article actually contains the filing document and that provides more significant detail than what the news reports are saying.\n\nThe suit is against both Desantis and the members of the Reedy Creek replacement board (plus a couple of other people), and it's against them acting in their official capacity (as opposed to a lawsuit against them personally).\n\nIt's a specific response to the latest FL legislation that nullifies the last-minute Reedy Creek contract with Disney.\n\nIt asks that this legislation be declared unconstitutional and that FL be prohibited from enforcing it.\n\nIt offers 5 reasons for doing so, including illegal government interference in a business contract, illegal taking of property (the contract is considered property and by nullifying it, the govt is essentially confiscating it), and violation of Disney's right to freedom of speech (which includes political speech).\n\nIANAL, but to me this reads as a guaranteed \"nope\" card played by Disney. As much as I'd love to see what discovery unearths, I wouldn't be surprised if there ends up being a summary judgement im Disney's favor.Good for Disney!Here before there\u2019s like 44.6k upvoteswe live in such an embarrassing timelineThat I am now, I guess, rooting for mfing *Disney* of all companies just shows how insanely far gone this timeline and reality are. Unbelievable.Discovery will be interesting. What dirt will Disney\u2019s lawyers find? Damn well know Ron & Co. explicitly stated somewhere in text that retaliation was the point.Can\u2019t wait for discovery to leak.Let me iterate, the Mouse does not fuck around.  Desantis is about to find out what happens when The Ears go hard in the paint.The feuding just ended, the ass kicking is about to start and Ronnie is the only one bringing butt cheeksGood.You can't beat the mouse.Hopefully this will set some kind of groundwork or precedent for all of the rights we see being trampled in the southThe fight continues, and Mickey still hasn\u2019t even taken the gloves off yet.Funny how conservatives are getting bitten in the ass as a result of them fighting for 1st amendment free speech rights for corporations. Hope Mickey Mouse gets a lot of money out of this.*Let Them Fight.*I want a european youtuber to walk around in random european cities, and ask people this question: \"so, what do you think about America these days\", and just film peoole's reactions. I think not even the most hardened Americans would be prepared for the utter disgust you would see on people's faces.How about we not indoctrinate minors into left wing ideology or any ideology in school? How about we don\u2019t encourage minors to take hormone replacement therapy? How about we let parents raise their own kids as they see fit and let schools focus on teaching math, science, history and literature and let parents handle teaching kids about the hot button issues of the day?  Let\u2019s stop encroaching on parents raising their childrenIf they're successful, will this be the playbook for everyone else Pudding Finger tried to strong arm?The Governor is stupid for messing with a business that was breaking now laws.   Go Disney!One aspect I think people are missing in all of this. It\u2019s not just the theme park desantis was attacking. A lot of people live in that area. And he specifically created a board and targeted the citizens of that area for abuse. He didn\u2019t return that area to the people. He could have. But didn\u2019t.I would really like to see any money Disney gets out of this donated to LGBTQIA+ charities.They will be happy to pay any price as long as they feel the lib is ownedWhen OCP is the good guy and you're looking forward to them deploying the EDs...It is an interesting twist. The fact of the matter in this case is that Disney is more concerned with public opinion than DeSantis is.\n\nDeSantis can do things that are unpopular with 75% of Florida voters without much risk. They are not going to kick him out of office, most of them would be reluctant to even admit that they are not completely onboard with the war on Disney. They have hitched their wagons to him, and basically trust him to show them the way. If he does something they do not like, it should be ignored, because of all the \"good\" he is doing.\n\nDisney can't really afford to piss off 75% of the population. They have an image to protect that has been around for 100 years and will still be here 100 years in the future. Any decisions they make that do not age well will be with them for centuries. And any chance of a widespread boycott of their movies or theme parks could have a massive financial impact.\n\nNot that megacrops are a force for good. They will do what makes them the most money, and just happen to typically be more sensitive to the will of the majority. I'll bet Disney regrets having been as outspoken as they were originally, but now they are committed. DeSantis is an idiot who has picked them to be made an example of and refuses to let the fight end without Disney bowing to his demands.I mean, this is essentially the plot of Atlas Shrugged.There may be an injunction and maybe a settlement. Otherwise it will probably go through the federal courts. Disney may win but who \nwho can remember the last time this federal statute has been testedBruh, they said it in fucking press conferences.Problem is, the people who are making it that way would relish the fact that \u201cstuck-up\u201d \u201ccommie\u201d Europeans don\u2019t like us.Europe is a continent of glass houses. Transphobia and right wing politics are on the rise *globally* \n\nEurope isn\u2019t immune.Are you lost? Wtf does any of the nonsense you're saying have to do with this lawsuit?The left isn\u2019t indoctrinating your kids. Other people seeking medical treatment for their conditions isn\u2019t encouraging your kids to do it. \n\nYour kids cannot receive any of this healthcare without parental consent. So how about *you* let parents handle raising and teaching *their kids* instead of using the nanny state to dictate right wing ideology to them?Wrong article for this talking point, Pyotr. It's getting late in st. Petersburg,  grab a warm bowl of borscht when your shift lets out.What exactly does any of this have to do with Rhonda abusing his power?And if Disney is smart they'll do exactly that.  The PR rewards would outstrip the dollar amount they'd be donating.Or open a LGTBQIA+ themed section, with DeSantis as the \"goofy\" mascot.Or re-edit The Last Jedi to remove the universe-breaking Holdo maneuver.The Oregon Catholic Press is going to deploy erectile dysfunctions?!Robocop FTW.They probably don't regret speaking out. It has made them more popular with an audience that they were somewhat losing ground on at one point in recent years. In fact, they've been leaning into more diverse and accepting stories and actions in the last several years alone. As a big corporation and an entertainment monolith they've been pretty conservative throughout their history, but they've been pushing more and more progressive for about two decades. They weren't going to just say nothing and lose all that progress with a tough crowd over a single governor's actions.\n\nThey very likely didn't anticipate the level of absurdity that DeSantis would go to scrape any sort of win out of this - but that doesn't mean they'll roll over either. They probably thought he was smarter than this and just bluster and blow at them meaninglessly. Instead he's picked a fight he likely cannot win and it IS going to make him look weak when he loses. Unpopular/popular actions go uncared about in the MAGA crowd, but they don't want their leader being embarrassingly weak. It's why his poll numbers have been dropping.I agree.  The situation is as dumb as the \"plot\" of that novel.What \"federal statute\" are you referring to? Disney is suing on Constitutional grounds.Capotalism really trojan horse'd them while they were out scouting for the commie threat, didn't itEurope is worse than the States on these issues, it\u2019s just that American media has a loud media megaphone to elevate its dumbest dumb-dumbs.It\u2019s about the bill, the one that has been labeled the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay bill\u201d, HB 1557.  No one gave a shit about how autonomous reedy creek was with Disney until Ron wanted to get schools in Florida to stop doing the things I mentioned and was adamant on not letting reedy creek be an exception because of Disney\u2019s influence.  The only reason anyone cares is because of the content of HB 1557They shouldn\u2019t be told by schools that hormone therapy is even an option though.  When you have schools educating on those issues, children are more likely to want that path.  The entire trans topic should be handled by parents completely.\n\nI haven\u2019t advocated for any right wing teaching either. Just teach the basic core subjects math, history, science and language.  That\u2019s it. Schools didn\u2019t even touched the trans issues in the 2000s and that worked.  Now that it\u2019s being taught about in schools and teachers are being it up, more and more minors and and young adults are struggling with their gender identity and seeking hormone replacement therapy for it. This isn\u2019t a coincidenceWhat is pyotr, sounds like some Greek name or something?What the actual Hell does that have to do with any of this?No, the oral contraceptive Pills are going to deploy the Ehlers-Danlos SyndromeI think I misremembered bill of attainder. But I also thought that it was illegal at the federal level to crest laws that were intended to specifically punish groups or individualsThe things you mentioned are wholly fabricated and the don\u2019t say gay bill is poor legislation that targets minorities under the guise of non-issues.Are schools telling kids hormone therapy \u201cis an option\u201d? \n\nAnd even if the schools did do that....minors cannot get that kind of care without parental or guardian consent.\n\n\nNo, it\u2019s not a coincidence, it\u2019s the left handedness graph all over again. \n\nTrans people are more visible and accepted now than they have been in the past, information is easier for those questioning to get a hold of, so, of course more people are openly identifying as trans. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being trans.I guess global studies would be part of that liberal indoctrination.It\u2019s true, all of it.It is. Bills of attainder are forbidden by the Constitution. Article 1.> illegal at the federal level \n\nIllegal at any level due to the [Supremacy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause).You literally have teachers in schools that are using alternative pronouns. You can\u2019t use alternative pronouns without having a kid raise their hand and asking why. It forces kids to be exposed to the trans ideology, which schools shouldn\u2019t be doing.  Even beyond that, drag queens have literally done story time for young children. You cannot tell me that schools are not exposing children to the transgender topicPerhaps there is some level of visibility, but the outright explosion of trans identification has made no sense.  What is going on is that minors and even young adults are being told that if they don\u2019t fit in with typical gender stereotypes, then it\u2019s likely that they\u2019re trans as opposed to being a tomboy or being gay, which in previous years they would\u2019ve more commonly accepted if given enough time. Go to the undeveloped world, and it\u2019s incredibly difficult if not impossible to find anyone that identifies as transgender, because the concept doesn\u2019t exist.  But when you\u2019re young, you feel alone, don\u2019t feel like you fit in, you easily attach to any group or movement where you see people with the same struggles finding community and you conform to that group.  Back in the 2000s a lot of young people were goth or emo which is fine because they\u2019re not trying to do irreversible damage to their bodies or begging their parents for it for permission to do so.  Even if they\u2019re denied it, they just wait till they turn 18 when their brain is still 7 years away from full development to wreck their own bodies.  A lot of this could be prevented if parents handled the trans issues exclusively without having to contend with what teachers are telling their children.  We shouldn\u2019t be telling kids that getting cross sex hormone replacement is a good idea or that it\u2019s the best response to being confused about gender. But when schools talk about it, that\u2019s what they teach, which is why parents should be left to handle these topicsWhat the actual Hell does that have to do with any of this?I\u2019m telling you that you are misinformed and...wrong. Drag story time isn\u2019t a school event. It\u2019s also non mandatory\u2014you don\u2019t have to go. \n\nMinors can\u2019t receive healthcare with out parental consent already.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what to tell you about pronouns....they\u2019re a basic part of our language. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s any of your business what pronoun someone uses. Pronouns aren\u2019t harming your children.Oh noes, a drag queen came to a school and did story telling. Yes, i can already see the lines of indoctrinated childeren asking for hormone replacements therapy...\n\nBeing seriously, school is more then giving just basic teachings and give childeren the opportunity to learn more about the world and people around them. That includes more regular topics like sex ed. or in this case newer topics like transexuals and everything around it. If you don't like it, don't put them in a public school.What public schools have had drag story time?It's true, all of itUnfortunately public school is the only option most people have.  I mean if we just started seeing public school teachers teaching that abortion is morally reprehensible, you probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate it if someone told you to just not send your kid to public schools.  You\u2019re either okay with schools teaching ideology or you\u2019re not. You can\u2019t be like \u201cit\u2019s okay for them to teach my ideology but not yours\u201d because that would make you a hypocrite. I say they shouldn\u2019t teach any ideology periodhttps://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jun/16/eric-adams-throws-support-behind-drag-queen-story-/\n\nPlenty of ones in New York as their own government has even funded itSome idealogies are humane, some are not. Also, teachers saying abortions are reprehensible is far more concerning then a dragqueen doing storytelljgg. C'mon, apples and oranges my man. \n\nIf you're really that affraid of transgenders indoctrinating childeren then maybe the problem lies with you?So the governor of Florida is banning all LGBTQ books, mention of them and countless other actions because NY did something\u2026\u2026\n\nInteresting.Maybe that wasn\u2019t the best example, but my point is if you don\u2019t like the idea of schools teaching or showing children anything with a socially conservative bend, but you\u2019re okay with a socially liberal one, then you\u2019re being biased and hypocritical.  Either you have it all or you have none of it.  I think the latter is a lot more doable for reasons I\u2019ll get into in the next paragraph, but even with that issues of sex are very sensitive and matter a lot to parents even more so than teaching or advocating for something like socialism.\n\nYeah technically some ideologies are humane but if a particular ideology is one that is controversial and only roughly half the country can get behind it, then that\u2019s not something that should be taught in schools.  Schools should be teaching values or \u201cideologies\u201d that are universally accepted as good amongst both liberal and conservative individuals. Maybe schools could teach about those topics if it came from a neutral perspective or had gotten to see both the left and right sides of the issue, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on in schools. We all know teachers are more likely to lean left, and we know that in some environments conservatives teacher\u2019s probably have to keep their views to themselves unlike their liberal counterparts, and perhaps there are some schools in some districts where the reverse is true.",

Keep working and talking sanely to the voters. At least Karamo is hunting demons. \n\nhttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/michigan-gop-elects-election-denier-kristina-karamo-chair.htmlAnd all it took was making voting slightly fairer with more  reasonable districtsWhen the voters ended gerrymandering while the legislature was full of GOP loons you knew some major changes were likely.  MAGA made a bad situation far worse since they are delusional.It died without gerrymandering.  Imagine that.Better dead than red.Quick now do the other 49 statesMay the contagion spread. \u2018Nuff said.This is the case in California too. And nationwide it\u2019s on its way slowly. The party lost any sense of an ideology or economic agenda in the Bush years. That was clear in the primaries that Trump won. They don\u2019t stand for anything any more. The best they can do is be against progress. \n\nI think progressives would do well to closely watch the locations where republicans have collapsed and start third parties from the left in those locations when they\u2019re ready.Same is happening in MN.I mean, there's no cohesive platform outside of big business tax cuts and weird culture war stuff. It doesn't help that the party chair is a certifiably nuts MAGA/QAnon loon, so I doubt she's either interested or able to corral party members and build meaningful cooperation. I guess the GOP hardline works if you're rich and/or live in a homogenous rural community, but the rest of us share a society and actually want it to not suck. That requires taxes and agreeing on communal rules that facilitate a productive, peaceful and happy society. We already tried dictating strict social conformity enforced by the gov't and Americans have spent the last 60 years rejecting it. GOP policies are basically antithetical to all of the progress of the last 200 years.Uh ok, then. Anyways, who wants some good ropa vieja or some beers or something?They did it to themselves. Let\u2019s hope this is a trend. The GOP needs to be stopped, they are damaging to our country.California GOP: First Time?Maybe time for them to get off the Trump train and stop drinking the fascist koolaid?National party is next.Truly the anti-FloridaFlorida uno reverse.The republican party relied too heavily on gerrymandering. \nSuddenly they were faced with having to compete in fair elections which and they were not structured to do.Without gerrymandering the shit out of Michigan, it\u2019s hard for GOP.Unfortunately, the Michigan GOP probably a zombie.  Some combination of Democratic overreach and funding from out of state billionaires will likely bring it back to life.  Though hopefully, only to a feeble barely sentient state,Ahh, they\u2019re just getting there before the National party faces the same fate.Tell that to the UP.  It\u2019s still a MAGA rally up here.\u201cDemocrats are satanic baby killers\u201d\u2026.\u201dI just don\u2019t understand why voters think we are lunatic extremists.\u201dFeeling schaudenfreudaYou\u2019re own fucking fault. FAFO.\u201cNow do my state!\u201d \u2013 everyone in this thread\"And nothing of value was lost.\"The best thing that could happen is for GOP moderates to sever ties with the GOP and then found a new party with the goal of bridging the gap with younger voters through a realignment of policies. \n\nThis will mean dropping evangelism and other traditionally \u2018conservative\u2019 ideals that carried the party from the Reagan-era on in favor of a new more moderate grass-root movement. \n\nThe Neo-American Bloc of Gen Z and Millennials are going to become the dominant voting bloc very soon with something around 19 million Gen Z becoming eligible to vote in 2024 alone. \n\nAnd conservative policies, particularly far-right policies of the Trump-era are just not popular with this new bloc in the slightest and no amount of doubling down is going to fix it. In fact, Millennials are the first generation that is not getting more conservative as they get older but instead are getting more liberal. The GOP power base is thus shrinking. \n\nSo bad have traditional conservative policies been for the average American, particularly those in this new bloc, that unless the GOP undergoes a massive rework in redefining what conservatism is, it will continue to see major losses at the polls. The Red Wave of 2020 and 2022 became Red Mirages as an example.\n\nAnd it\u2019s time to face it: Republican Conservatism is over. The GOP now is majority Trump-era Republicans with the Neocons having been voted out from 2016 to now. \n\nThe Dems stand to gain a lot in the coming elections and Texas, what was once a bulwark of the GOP\u2019s hold on the south, is now trending so hard towards a flip that if it does flip blue, the Republicans will never win another presidential race for over a decade. \n\nThe last presidential election saw 5.8 million Texans vote Republican and 5.2 million Texas vote Democrat. 600k votes was the deciding factor and we\u2019re looking at 19 million new voters. And at 38 electoral votes, there is no possible way to win if/when it flips.And stay out!Long may it rotBummer.\n\n(/s just in case)Everything Donald trump touches diesTraitors turn in each other.Never go full nazi\u202649 to go.Have they tried upping the hateful rhetoric?\"Welcome to the Hotel California...\"Wisconsin,  PLEASE take noteMaybe, just maybe, you should stop nominating shitheads like Tudor Dixon and Kristina Karamo. And maybe, just maybe, you should stop choosing election deniers to chair your party. Just a thought.\n\nThe Minnesota Republican Party has the same problem. They haven't won a statewide election since 2006. They nominate the biggest weirdoes in the state -- as if we're East Dakota -- and then act surprised when they lose.I've lived in Michigan my whole life, and I've never been happier with our state's government than I am right now. The progressive women leading our state are capable and fearless, and they are delivering improvements across the board. Without a huge scandal, it will be next to impossible for the Michigan Republican Party to sell a more appealing vision to voters here. They have zero ideas for how to make our lives bettter. The only play in their playbook is to try to conjur up scary \"boogey-man\" stories and convince voters to be angry and afraid and turn to the GOP to protect them. That dog won't hunt when things are working so damn well.The Republican political strategy is to imitate the Democrats as much as possible, win nothing and lose everything, all the time.Yea. Palpatine died too. /sOne down, 49 states to go.Are gop defining their hate as god\u2019s good work. They use the bible to just make shit up.Maybe plotting to kidnap a governor isn\u2019t how you win votes. Who could have foreseen this. F**k emThe Michigan GOP must become party of RooseveltSupporting? By their own admission, they are all domestic terroristsThe megadonors are funding the agents of KAOS.   ~~Rembrandt von Bronzefinger, Roger Hammerstein, the Groovy Guru, Otto of Oberfurstengoggle and Dr. Lazlo von Havok~~. the Heritage Society.\u201cWhen it\u2019s a genuine Rape by a political party, the body politic has a way of shutting it down.\u201dJudge Janet is coming for those GOP districts with a sledgehammer \u270a\ud83c\udffcIt\u2019s a death cult trying to enter a murder-suicide pact with their would-be constituents. How long before a majority of Texans recognize that? I don\u2019t see a huge difference between party rhetoric in TX versus MI.\n\nIs it really just voter suppression?We voted to dismantle gerrymandering, crazy how that worked out. The power vacuum that was left when the Republicans lost has made them loose their minds.\u201cThe GOP died alone\u201d\n\n*biker looks to camera*It could be California all over again.Interesting new take on the old saying haha.Oh, it's on life support here in California.Same story with Colorado GOP already: https://coloradosun.com/2022/11/13/nicolais-colorado-republican-party-opinion/Well, probably do ranked choice voting or similar before any fucking around with third parties.[Got ya covered.](https://d1ynl4hb5mx7r8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174146/No-Yeah_12oz_Can_6pk1-1024x569.jpg)I could go for some ropa vieja.It\u2019s alive and well in the rural areas and arguably more toxic.  Real question is if the Democratic party will run more to the center in those districts.The UP is a beautiful place. Can\u2019t wait to spend another vacation up that way.GOP need to become party of RooseveltI hate Michigan Nazis\"Senator of the planet where the ET's come from. I assure you... I. Am not. Evil.\"You have to Get Smart to truly appreciate this comment.Probably in league with the P.A.G.A.N.s too.I haven\u2019t been following any of this. Sounds exciting\u2026Texas is one of the most difficult states to vote in, so it very well could be suppression.Michigan has ballot initiatives, which means we get to sidestep ineffective government in some cases.  One of the big side effects is that people see the impact of their votes.  We voted in November and Weed was legal less than 6 months later.  \n\nWe voted and now we have independent redistricting.  \n\nWe voted and now we have reproductive rights protected.\n\nMotivates people to vote.The big thing is the GOP keeps doubling down on topics which are focused on an active portion of their shrinking base.\n\nDue to a large dependence on older voters, and policies which are much less attractive to younger people, the GOP has been facing a demographic crisis for ages and depended on a reliable base and apathetic voters. (hence the 2012 post-mortem predicting a crisis for the GOP unless they expanded) \n\nBut the folks who got control of the agenda are extremists whose positions are ideological and alienate both people outside and inside their party. So not only do they embrace policies which increased their deaths from Covid at a time when they are already shedding voters, but they've managed to motivate a lot of folks into voting more regularly.\n\nThe GOP depended far too much on pro-lifers in their base and let them write a lot of laws that they never thought would go into effect. Now that they actually got Roe reversed, they have to deal with how crazy and alienating the base was allowed to get at the same time they are more dependent. \n\nHence a lot of efforts to make voting harder to try and maintain power as their ability to win it in fair elections is no longer possible.No, it\u2019s not just voter suppression. It\u2019s also an obscene level of gerrymandering at the state and national district levels. It\u2019s also a state government with no provision for citizens to push state level ballot initiatives. It\u2019s also a deeply entrenched power system across all levels of government that prioritizes Republican Party control over constitutional governance. It\u2019s also abusive and oppressive state control over city level governance that erases liberal initiatives (with the help of a corrupt state judiciary). It\u2019s also a closed primary system that only allows voters to vote in one party\u2019s primary. \n\nIt\u2019s all those things and one of the most oppressive and systematic voter suppression regimes in the country, which really shouldn\u2019t be minimized here. Texas has provisions that make it much harder for students to vote, active propaganda campaigns targeted at minority populations, voter ID targeted at poor and minority populations, one of the most Byzantine voter registration systems in the country, severely restricted polling locations in heavily blue urban areas, police forces and state level organizations that actively engage in voter intimidation, etc. \n\nThese are not simple problems for Texans to solve on our own. Even when we finally get a blue vote for any of the statewide elections, they\u2019re going to ratfuck it just like they did in Wisconsin. This is going to be a long fight. Without federal interventions to prevent voter suppression, undo gerrymandering, and prevent corrupt abuses of power, Republicans hold all the levers of power. \n\nSo it\u2019s not a simple matter to unwind the GOP\u2019s chokehold on Texas.YesGerrymandering is playing elections on tutorial mode, not even easy mode. But they've been doing it for so long, and to such an extreme degree, they thought they're all electoral geniuses. They don't know how to campaign, debate, compromise, or anything else important to winning competitive elections. They just screech, get donations, and expect winning to follow, because that's how it's always worked for them.\n\nHave you ever seen that [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/10p7tu7/young_bird_expecting_the_worm_to_jump_in_its/) of the baby bird out of its nest chasing like a worm, grub, caterpillar, something like that? It's used to just opening its mouth and having its mama drop food in its mouth. So it goes up to the bug and just holds its mouth open, expecting the bug to just magically fly into its mouth, because that's all it knows.\n\nThat's like the GOP when they lose gerrymandering.\n\nETA: baby bird video linkAnd when they begged swing voters to save them, the swing voters looked down and whispered \"No.\"Same with Illinois!*No, Yeah* is so goodWhat is it?Pretty redneck up here.A couple of weeks ago the most expensive state judicial election in US history happened in Wisconsin, where liberal judge Janet Protasiewicz won, and with it democrats regained control of the state Supreme Court. Now the Court has 4 liberals and 3 conservatives, and is expected to strike down an abortion ban passed in 1849 that went back into effect after Row v Wade was overturned, as well as decide on a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s (very gerrymandered) republican-drawn redistricting maps. \n\nI started reading about it in the run up to the election, about how the districts are so gerrymandered that it\u2019s mathematically impossible for democrats to win anywhere, and about how expensive the race was. It\u2019s been a wild story to follow, The Daily and The Post Reports podcasts both have pretty good episodes on itI always thought is was pretty much weed that got us redistributed.Ohio is going the opposite direction.How is Michigan btw? Do you like the state? I understand it's more of a purple state going blue, but do you feel much less at risk of crazies \"infecting\" the state? I'm in a purple state with a deep red fascist shithole south of me and I'm really worried about it spreading here, so am looking at other States to move to - one of them being MIThis is the perfect metaphor for why Ron DeSantis is struggling. He's got a trifecta of power in Florida, so his merest whim is carried out perfectly with no questions or pushback. This gave rise to the \"DeSantis is Trump but smart\" myth.\n\n Once he got outside of that cushy state and had to actually convince people of his plans, all his policies are got ragdolled, sometimes by other Republicans.Great analogy.I\u2019m from southern Indiana, redneck doesn\u2019t faze me any.I see it as a watershed moment.  It was wildly progressive relative to the state government at that point in time and it was implemented very quickly in the context of government action.  \n\nDemonstrated how significant the impact of voting could have on a population that didn\u2019t have much faith in government.As is tradition.Pretty happy with it.  I live on the west side of the state, so I have a ton of crazy local to me.  Like Q-anon headquarters at a restaurant less than 30 minutes away.  However they are pretty well kept in check by the rest of the population.  Like I have to pay attention to school board and local elections but generally the crazies lose, not always but generally.  \n\nYour mileage will also vary greatly depending on where you are in the state.The dictator\u2019s dilemma. The dictator is weak without his cronies kissing his ass at all times.I have never seen people at the polls I like I did for the weed year.  SpongeBob Pajama pants as far as the eye could see. But it was a brilliant move to include redistricting on that particular ballot.Have you noticed that the Sponge Bob Pajama Pant has taken the place of the Tweety Bird/Looney Tunes Pajama Pants favored by the trash of Michigan since the 90s?",

Anita Hill told the truth.Clarence Thomas could not possibly care any less.  He is completely unaccountable, and he is well aware of that.  There chance of him resigning or being impeached is exactly zero.  I'm all for all of the noise and pressure on him, to further expose his corruption and hypocrisy.  But, people need to understand that he is not going anywhere.Everyone knows Liz Warren but Markey is a great Senator and I'm glad he represents me.The last SCOTUS justice to resign due to financial scandal was Democrat appointed and Democrats called for him to step down even though it meant the GOP was going to get to pick the next justice. \n\nNot only that, the disgraced justice tried to make the situation right. \n\nBoth parties are NOT the same.Thomas Clarence and his reckless wife wanted to overturn the election because they have money interests at stake that should have been declared but didn\u2019t declare it because shit walks but money talks. This guy lied about Anita Hill and he played dramatics when he was getting confirmed he said to Patrick Leahy that he would have preferred to get a bullet in the head instead of getting through confirmation with Anita Hill spilling the beans on him. That was an act that should have gotten nominated for an Oscar. Now we know how much he loves law and how much he loves MONEY, I think it\u2019s reasonable to conclude he loves MONEY much more than law. Get Clarence Thomas off the US Supreme Court by impeaching him. He lost all his creditability and so did his wife especially as we found out she played a big part in trying to overturn the 2020 elections, she should be in jail also.Thomas appears to have committed a crime. Could someone please explain to me why there's no talk of charging him?Get this useless fucking shill outta there, ASAP please.He blasted the non declaration of gifts and requested justice Thomas to kindly resign.\n\nEd said, \u201cAs one really ancient man to another. Please resign.\u201dGood luck doing something about this fraud : Clarence Thomas. He is poison for America!Joe Biden was  head of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chair when Clarence Thomas was appointed.That oughta do it.What need to be said, Senator, is that the highest court in the USA is comprised, at least partly, of criminals, put there by criminals, and whitewashing this as \"the political process of a democracy\" is pathetic, addict-behavioral, denialist, lying bullshit.\u201cNo more Supreme Court malarkey\u201d - Ed Markey.Does Marley look just like Jimmy Page?[deleted]Actually Markey and Warren should resign.As did Christine Blasey Ford but here we are at Beach Week.Sadly at the time President Biden (then Senator Biden) did not believe her.Certainly not while a Democrat is in the Oval Office.You are absolutely right. He's not going anywhere and no one can do a damn thing about it.If nothing else maybe we can annoy him a little.Him not going anywhere is precisely why we need to keep hammering the courts credibility.It would be an ethics violation not a misdemeanor or felony. Unlike every other court in America the Supreme Court does not have a code of ethics to enforce violations thoughMarkey or Warren?Can you believe it?\n\nA nominee confirmed when the Senate was controlled by a different party than the presidency!\n\nWhat primitive unrefined times those were.\n\nI\u2019m sure glad we amended the constitution so that SCOTUS nominees can only be confirmed when the Senate majority\u2019s party is the same as the president\u2019s.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I hear from Mitch McConnell.That was it was lawful for that to happen...? I don't know what you are looking for, that's the way this should work.[deleted]He wasn\u2019t in office when Kavanaugh was nominated. What did Biden do this time?He voted against Thomas\u2019 nominationThe last SCOTUS justice to resign due to financial scandal was Democrat appointed and Democrats called for him to step down even though it meant the GOP was going to get to pick the next justice.\n\nBoth parties are NOT the same.What does that even mean?Thanks for the clarification. It's amazing that to me that it is legal!ClarenceThis is one of things that only seems clever to someone incredibly stupid.You're indirectly letting the Democratic Party off the hook for letting massively unqualified, dangerous, and corrupt people through when they had the opportunity to block them. It's just one more example of how America's particular flavor of bipartisanship is usually terrible for the average American, and often even the country as a distinct entity therefrom.Right. What a weird question. Dems would be frustrated and not like the situation, but it would clearly be constitutionally fine. \n\nWhat I, as a liberal, take umbrage with is the fact that the Republicans justification for refusing to hold hearing for Garland\u2019s Supreme Court nomination was to \u201clet the voters decide\u201d as it was too close to an election, and then they turned around and confirmed Coney-Barrett during an active election in which votes had already been cast. I wonder how republicans justify such hypocrisy.You may want to sit down for this: we actually *did* land on the moon.It was years ago during the Anita Hill hearings on Thomas. \n\nHe was a senator then. He openly disbelieved her accounts of obvious sexual harassment.Who was that?Right, both parties totally not the same. One committed an insurrection and the other did absolutely nothing about it. Totally different in every possible way.\n\nJust a reminder that the constitution gives the US president, and only the US president, the power and responsibility to enforce the laws.A Democrat president would then nominate the next justice. Thomas would never resign during a democrats presidency because he is loyal to a different political party.Dubiously legal, ethics violations can get you heavy fines, disbarred, and/or otherwise banned from many professions. But again, the Supreme Court doesn't have a code of eithics...Oh no, I am not letting them off the hook.\n\nI was a kid during Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearings, but it is shameful the way Anita Hill was treated.\n\nEven in an era when the Senate did their job of confirming nominees when the president was of the opposing party, they still had a duty to vet nominees.They are hypocrites. They don\u2019t need to justify it. That\u2019s what hypocrites do.[deleted]I stand corrected.Abe FortasThat's a big fart noise from me budSee, that makes sense now. Thank you.You misspelled terrorist group.He could totally resign anytime between now and November \u201824 and the GOP would just say it\u2019s an election year next year so we should wait and see. The rules about appointments already don\u2019t matter because they decided it doesn\u2019t.Ya know, maybe disbarment is a viable option here.And they were against Thomas?   \n\n\nI don't understand your point other than you're taking the side of people accused of sexual harassment that had a history of questionable behavior against victims who didn't.[deleted]Confirmation isn't a court of law.  He's not going to lose his freedom based on the outcome.  He just doesn't get to be a SC Justice.  The bar isn't that high.\n\nIt's highly plausible that he assaulted her. Moreover, the FBI investigation about it was tanked by Trump. There was never hope of definitively establishing the truth.",

It shouldn't be that hard, but apparently it is.That's not limited to her, that's conservativism in a nutshell. They accuse others of something they are doing trying to shift blame.\n\nI'm Canadian and the subreddit of my country (a very conservative biased one unfortunately) is completely overrun by people saying this every single day that the Liberals/Trudeau are \"divisive\". I mean you can't open a comment thread without stumbling on a comment saying this somewhere. But in reality, the only \"divisive\" thing he ever did was calling people out for their own dividing actions and statements. They have only themselves to blame, but that won't stop them to keep parroting it.When my youngest was in 1st grade, our mayor came and talked about what mayors and city council members do.  How they try to attract new businesses, fix roads and sidewalks etc. He never mentioned his political views, just what elected civil servants are supposed to do. Somehow I don't imagine Bobo did that. (Oh, the school sent permission slips home for his visit AND invited the parents to come)Maybe the folks in Colorado's 3rd congressional district should reconsider voting for Lauren Boebert, again.  \n\nShe also owned Shooters Grill, a restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, from 2013 to 2022 (where staff members were encouraged to carry firearms openly) might just want to think twice about supporting her, yet again.The parents weren't even allowed to see a transcript of the assembly. So much for \"parental rights\"- another republican myth exposed, it was always about manipulation and control. She spoke at the high school to earn votes from young people who will be 18 soon.Former call girl and traitor Lauren BoebertEvery accusation is a confession. Every. Time.If I found out that Lauren Boebert spoke at my child\u2019s school after the fact without giving me the opportunity to keep them home that day, I\u2019d be angry enough to sue for damages, distress, assault, kidnapping, indoctrination and anything else I could think ofThese people are not about freedom, they are about their world-view.  Stop being surprised by this and fight back.  \n\nBasic rule is their projections cover for their own actions.  And it's working. Stop it from working.Is this the first time she has ever entered an institute of learning?\u2026.awww, good for her, it\u2019s never too late to learn to read!They should be more appalled that she gets a vote in congress.Surprise surprise. When my daughter was young (about 5). it was always Republicans suggesting how she should vote.It\u2019s always projection with these fascistsThey should use her as a scared straight tactic remember kids what happened to that poor crazy lady could happen to you to so beware.What do students stand to gain from hearing from someone it took 3 attempts to earn their GED?Ironic she was talking to students in a grade she didn't even complete...I\u2019m surprised she even knew where a school was\u201cNow it turns out\u201d? \n\nAlways was.She is married to a pedo.Stop playing!

The \"Christian\" whose 17 year old son got a 14 year old girl pregnant? \nOne disgusting stupid a-hole crazed woman.It turns out she is divisive? No. Shit.This horrible excuse of a human being came to Texas near where I live to campaign for other far right crazies in municipal elections, including my local school board.\n\nMade sure to vote against them the first day of early voting.Who had the dumb idea to allow Lauren Boebert to speak?\n\nYou just don't do that man.It\u2019s practically the first time she\u2019s been in a school.\"turns out\"One might say she was \u201cgrooming\u201d these kids.Talk about indoctrination. I would livid!!!!Boebert working hard to make Coloradans proud of their elected representation, as she is with the start of the 18 session on Congress. Very interesting based on her husband past that the person she hangs with is child predator Matt Gaetz!Serious question: Why is is that if I were to post a slightly inappropriate meme to my company\u2019s group emails I get fired yet her and MTG can spout conspiracy theories all day long ok twitter for all of the world to see and still keep their job.It took that gremlin *four* tries  to get a GED, and she couldn't until she was thirty goddamn four. Her every utterance is invalidColor me 'surprised'. Color her 'stupid'.She looks like a blow up doll.She\u2019s KKK Barbie. Some people are now just realizing this?!?The transference in this one is strong.ProjectionDo not get mad... VOTE THEM OUT!Well yeah. They yell about the other side \u201cdoing\u201d the exact thing they do or want to do. Republicans want to indoctrinate your kids in their schools, the changes in that direction are to prevent the \u201cindoctrination\u201d liberals have been \u201cdoing\u201d.I\u2019d be pulling my kid from that school.I really fucking hate herI am outraged she\u2019s allowed to speak in generalNow? Now it turns out????\n\nIf you only noticed it now you haven't been paying any attention.I would be so pissed if this happened to my kids.If she spoke at my child\u2019s school I would sue them for exposure to harmful toxins>Boebert answered that her mother influenced her political decisions more than anyone else, sharing that her family had been deceived by politicians and empty promises, keeping them trapped in a cycle of poverty until Boebert got a job at age 15.\n\nFucking lol. The party of personal responsibility, folks.\n\nPathetic>We have to stop indoctrination by removing all doctrines but our own. Then they will have no choice but to join us.She\u2019s trying to indoctrinate students now?!Why do so many of her and her lunatic friend MTGross have their mouths agape like they are ready to accept any c0ck that will further their careers?What if it was a Dem, would that have been okAlways\u2026has\u2026been\u2026??She needs to be \u201ccorrected\u201dMaybe she was just talking about her love for bowling\u2026 alley\u2019s\u2026 restrooms \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fShe is exactly what she says others are. Typical Republican projection.i mean, she is a congressperson. a garbage congressperson, but an elected rep nonetheless. \n\nif you dont like her going to schools as a rep vote for someone different. kids can detect her evil.Are we sure she was at a school to speak and not there to finish classes?This is crazyIf boebert ever talked at my school I would\u2019ve walked out. I don\u2019t need to hear anyone\u2019s political opinion in highschool. Or college for that matter. Im there to learnEvery accusation is an admition. It is getting beyond ridiculous.It\u2019s unclear to me why she visited? Was it just to give a speech? If so, that\u2019s\u2026 odd and not cool.\n\nI\u2019m a teacher. Our congressional representative has been to visit the high school on a couple of occasions - most recently we had a STEM fair at the high school that involved industry partners and student presentations about industry.  His speech was not remotely divisive. He congratulated the kids and talked about how he\u2019d work to support STEM and education in our state.I\u2019m just surprised Bobo has been in a school.Normally I\u2019d say that I think the students could learn something hearing from a victim of grooming (via a registered sex offender). Unfortunately this one sends the wrong message.It's always the one constantly accusing you of cheating , that's cheating .I feel like the more we hear from Boebert and Mtg the worse it is for the Republican party. I think 2024 will show just how unpopular they have become because of the crazy.She has been the whole timeRepublicans doing the thing they are mad about and accuse others of doing?  *shocked pikachu face*Can an absolute moron indoctrinate?Right wing groomerSomebody voted her weird ass in lol, so glad she's not in my state, enjoy lolHow does a high school drop-out have the education to MAKE laws?  (Trick question..... I know... Answer: They don't,  because they're so stupid... they couldn't finish high school, let alone LAW school.)Ignorant and Arrogant POS that she is. Will this idiots ever crawl back into their holeS in the ground!Not sure I\u2019d want a high school dropout giving lectures to my kid unless it\u2019s, \u201cdon\u2019t do what I did, stay in school\u201d.She was always the divisive content.It didn't just \"turn out\". It is what it has always been.\u201cThe parent was referring to Superintendent Tom Burris of the Montezuma-Cortez School District, who said that Boebert\u2019s office tried to schedule an assembly with high school and middle school students in that district but they declined because the district was \u201cfocusing energies on students in the classroom and academics.\u201d Burris said that he offered to give Boebert a tour of the schools instead.\u201d \n\nLolr/leopardsatemyfaceHate speech queenNow that's a mouth I'd like to wave my dick atBig surprise their hypocrites. How do you think they get their ideas for things to be outraged about? How long until we find out MTG is a pedophilePenises for in that hole just nice apparently.I am so looking forward to her demise in 2024.She is horrible\"Now it turns out...\" WTF. She always was...The parents are \u201coutraged \u201c !! Take some rage & Vote her out you have that ability. Apparently too busy to organize & vote her out .\ud83c\udfb6*real women of poooolitics*\ud83c\udfb6>Someone needs to be fired for very poor leadership.\n\nI volunteer Boebert.From the reporting that I\u2019ve read, it sounds like it was the Superintendent\u2019s bright idea. Should\u2019ve hired Chalmers instead.This is not a defense of Boebert per se, but do we know the content of her speech? Or the subject?\n\nMy congressman came and spoke to our high school class when I was in school and nobody batted an eye. But he wasn\u2019t Boebo\u2026Ya that\u2019s a trash title ngl>That's the entire reason Ted Cruz bought her a career\n\nI heard rumors that indicated other reasons too. Were those bullshit?[removed]Seriously though I feel it\u2019s a travesty that left leaning folks in red states are just shit out of luck. Firstly if there\u2019s any chance of improvement for that state they\u2019re the one\u2019s that can bring about any actual positive changes but they inherently lack the necessary political support.\n\nSecondly, a lot us fellow left leaning folks here tend to shit on that red state and feel some kind of catharsis when the people of that state are struggling because it\u2019s a majority R state (which is terrible in itself but I think it\u2019s still understandable), but we forget that the minority Ds are the one\u2019s that will truly be struggling:Now we need to include \"can't even learn about your own bodily functions as they are happening to you\" thanks to Flordia attempting to ban all discussion of menstruation.No one is even mumbling about small government anymore, the party's direction is very clear: we're against the other people! Their entire platform is now simply \"NO U\".The wealthiest churches have been at it for decades. \n\nThey need to radicalize their congregations in order to use them as a shield to protect their money laundering operations. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why megachurches don\u2019t get audited by the government.About as long as segregation academies have been at it.He sounds like one of these \"both sides\" assholesThey hate kids because their congressperson spoke to them? ...and [reckless driving and failure to show for court appearances.](https://www.westword.com/news/lauren-boebert-son-tyler-court-hearing-no-show-16620543)She\u2019s the congressperson of that district. When I was 17, the congressman of our district spoke to us. Kind of an overreaction to fire someone to try to get kids to engage civically. Relax. \n\nWhen the congressperson spoke to us, we realized he was incredibly out of touch. Next election, we voted for someone else. You might even recognize him, he\u2019s become a progressive leader in the democrat party, it\u2019s congressman Ro Khanna. Maybe this will lead to these kids voting for someone else in the Republican Party or a democrat. Maybe these kids will ask their parents who did vote for Boebert why they voted for, maybe convince them.Matt Walsh thinks it's very hot.  He also thinks children should be able to work in the sex industry as long as they aren't transgressing gender norms.She's an elected member of congress. That's how she's qualified.i miss when gov people did that.[School officials and Boebert\u2019s office billed the session in the Dolores Schools gymnasium as a kind of civics discussion, but the congresswoman also spoke of her efforts with the Freedom Caucus \u2013 a conservative bloc of Republican representatives \u2013 the U.S. response to COVID-19, and in response to students\u2019 questions, about her personal and political development](https://archive.is/BBDR4)I 100% agree with you. On the other hand\u2026 when I was in middle school & high school I would\u2019ve been fucking front row center to eat her ass up. I would\u2019ve loved the opportunity to embarrass her.Students were allowed to opt out.\n\n\"Two days before the congresswoman arrived in Dolores, school district officials emailed parents with details of her visit.\" \n\n[Students were not required to attend, the message continued, and those who wished to skip could go to a different classroom during that time.](https://archive.is/6HFfX)they could become a successful politician oh the horrorI find her persistence inspiring. I mean, it inspires nausea, but still.*checks notes* Superintendent Reece Blincoe and Principal Justin SchmidtShe's awful but you suck dude.That's just the picture democrats choose to use.Not if parents werent informed, allowed to attend and given a transcript of the speech later. The superintendent basically hid the whole thing from parents. So no it would not be ok to do that if it was a DemFor some reason our civil servants can\u2019t be fired or prosecuted.\ud83e\udd14Super Nintendo Chalmers?> but do we know the content of her speech? Or the subject?\n\nNo, and when parents asked to attend, they were refused entry. That's really unusual, as parents ~~are~~ were always allowed to observe any/all events like this. A politician coming to a school isn't just there to talk to the kids after all.We sort of get the content in the article (from a parent):\n\n>Boebert visited and spoke at the school in Dolores, Colorado on March 15, where she allegedly told students about \u201cmoral decay\u201d and how the COVID-19 pandemic was used to infringe on civil liberties. She talked about the far-right Freedom Caucus and told students that \u201cJesus was the biggest influence in her life,\u201d according to one parent.\n\nI mean that's enough for me. She brought religion in with her and who knows what she was referencing with \"moral decay\": could have been abortion, transgender rights, anything>but do we know the content of her speech? \n\nThere's some bits of it [here](https://www.the-journal.com/articles/rep-lauren-boebert-speaks-with-dolores-students-about-civic-engagement-and-rights-you-are-the-now/), but quite a bit has been left out like her remarks on COVID.Not exactly but I'm sure Boebert didn't either, just set the switch in her brain to hatred and let the word salad tumble outShe was supposed to be the rights AOC look-alike with Sarah Palin personality and Trump's attitude.They were probably true too.  Does Ted look like someone who *doesn't* have to pay for it?Whoa whoa whoa there bro, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves by using the term \u201cbullshit\u201d \u2026..we\u2019re just asking questions here that\u2019s all, we have a right to do that don\u2019t we?\n\n*confused tucker face*lol it seems YOU just gallivant about looking to call people out for capitalizing words. OBVIOUSLY it\u2019s meant for EMPHASIS, you knobLiberals have been in the minority in the south since Conservatives were Democrats.\n\nIts time for **nonviolent** civil disobedience. The Freedom Riders, Greensboro sit in, Montogomery Bus Boycott made change. Sue. Get litigious. Go after Fox and conservative advertisers. \n\nStaying online in our homes and being quiet is no longer an option.Thanks for your words.Yea, it fucking sucks here. I'm a math teacher, but what they're doing makes me fucking sick. That's not the only reason we're losing teachers. It's one of them, though.I'm sure they'll still take the boys aside and talk about the miracle of ejaculation over a couple of beers.I think he wanted Boebert to come and indoctrinate kids and not suffer the consequences of it. No one was allowed to question the point of this event or attend it except for kids or faculty, which he has obvious leverage over.Yeah, cause history has shown that those who only want their side heard are always the good guys.Speaks volumes about the people that elected her and  not her qualificationsAccording to whom? The school barred parents from attending. That in itself raises huge concerns. I\u2019m not convinced that the students weren\u2019t expected to attend whether they wanted to or notCalling her successful is a bit of a stretch when even members of her own party thinks she\u2019s a bit of a mental case.Except if your black, a woman, or Trans.How about the principal?Civil opportunist.The very same.Moral decay: \"Anything I don't like\".>\"moral decay\"\n\nTeenaged high school students getting impregnated  out of wedlock by 25 year-old sex-offenders was the moral high ground?I guess that's related to the 'Freedom' caucus that support a democratically elected lawmaker being [denied their right to speak](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trans-lawmaker-silenced-by-montana-house-speaker-as-legislature-debates-gender-affirming-care-ban) too.>\"You are the thing that you are participating in right now.\u201d\n\nso fucking eloquentShe\u2019s trying her best.Nah. He looks like someone who gets it for free from random dudes in a rest stop bathroom, then gets arrested for toe tap propositioning a state trooper just trying to take a dump in peace. Then he puts on surprised Pikachu face and starts telling everyone who will listen about his \u201cwide stance.\u201d That\u2019s just what I suspect based on him being the human being he is though.I think this saying applies to him: \u201cthe sex you want, you ain\u2019t getting, the sex you getting, you don\u2019t want\u201d.Some people don't understand literacy it seems.The problem is, largely, that we wouldn't be the violent ones in those scenarios. \n\nBut look who will bring out the guns.It's kids in school. The correct answer here is no sides.You really think sixth graders in a public school should hear this BS?\n\n\u201cBoebert visited and spoke at the school in Dolores, Colorado on March 15, where she allegedly told students about \u201cmoral decay\u201d and how the COVID-19 pandemic was used to infringe on civil liberties. She talked about the far-right Freedom Caucus and told students that \u201cJesus was the biggest influence in her life,\u201d according to one parent.\u201d\n\nWhen my rep visited my town\u2019s schools, we got a sleepier version of Schoolhouse Rock and learned about the legislative process, not conspiracy theories.Yeah, about that principal:\n\n\"The shocking revelation here is not only that Representative Boebert is willing to use public schools for partisan politics but that Dolores High School has convicted A3 conspirator Justin Schmitt as principal. It turns out he grew up and attended school there. In October, 2019 while under indictment for conspiracy to defraud the state of California out of $80,000,000, Schmitt was hired as Dean of Students in Dolores.\"\n\n\u201cSchmitt pleaded guilty to a felony count of taking money in order to conceal crime. The charge was later reduced to a misdemeanor and Schmitt was sentenced to one year probation.\u201d  \n\"In August 2021, Reece Blincoe was introduced as interim Superintendent of Dolores School District. He had previously served as superintendent for the Brownwood ISD in Brownwood, Texas. It appears that after seven years he was forced out of Brownwood with an agreement that included $300,000 for his resignation. There was no claim of malfeasance against Blincoe but there were rumors that it had to do with an unsubstantiated claim of bullying.\"  \n\"Blincoe, Schmitt and the rest of their team come out of the Boebert episode looking badly used and inept. What do they do when Boebert\u2019s Democratic challenger Adam Frisch comes to Dolores and requests a similar event? How can a public school that has already hosted one politician legitimately turn away another politician? There is no good answer.\"\n\n**Quoted from Blogger Thomas Ultican.

Literally states outright that he built a backroom conspiracy to mess with Disney.....my god.In the year of our lord, 2023, I'm rooting for the house of mouse to beat up a politician. We've gone through the looking glass.I'm surprised this didn't hit court a while ago.Even Trump knew not to come after DisneyNote that Disney filed suit in federal court, where DeSantis and the Florida legislature have no influence.  This isn't going to end well for him and I'm here with my popcorn... \ud83d\ude01TLDR: DeSantis crones voted to nullify agreements that Disney made. Disney filed the lawsuit ***minutes*** afterward.

Governments shouldn\u2019t be interfering with private business. \n\nAlso Republicans: let\u2019s ban books, cancel Bud Light, use the government to fuck with DisneyI belive Disney is using an ex Trump attorney, and Disney filing in a court where 2 of the 4 judges were appointed by Trump.\n\nAnd  Trump would love to see DeSantis get his ass kicked by Disney\n\nSo it'll be interesting to see how this goes.My therapist gets stressed out just a much as I do by the news and was trying to ignore it. Then realized she had to keep up to make sure the patients weren\u2019t imagining things. 26 inches of rain in Ft Lauderdale? Disney suing the sitting governor? Wasn\u2019t on my bingo card.\"Never thought I'd fight side by side with a soulless corporate entity.\"\n\n\"What about side by side with Disney?\"\n\n\"Aye.  I can do that.\"DeSantis literally laid out his plan to use the state of Florida to punish Disney for their free speech that he objected to.  It\u2019s like when Fox News anchors texted each other \u201cugh tired of saying all these lies about Dominion on air but we gotta keep ratings up!\u201d.Saw a tweet from Dan Rather about this.  He said the case is known as Mickey vs Dopey.As a freshman in high school, I was told that the theater people were gay. And where do theater want to work for a summer job? Disney. They get to dress up in costumes and play a character. \n\nWhen Disney came out against the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, they were just supporting their workers. \n\nDeSantis is fucking up trying to fight Disney. Everybody loves Disney. Don\u2019t fuck with the Mouse, Idiot.This is getting better than Trump and Desantis arguing.  Desantis is showing his true fascist self and is being taken down by a mouse!\n\n Fucking lovin it.Contracts Clause of the the US Constitution.  Easy win for DisneyWell, yeah.\n\nDeSantis used his political position to exact revenge against a single corporation in particular. It's clear as day.\n\nIt's only a shame this will be settled out of court.Hey republicans.  If this suit doesn\u2019t go through guess what that means for conservative businesses that fund your campaigns.  Would be rather interesting to see what democratic states could do to conservative businesses.\n\nBut that\u2019s what you get for refusing to speak up against DeSantis when you could have I guess.I imagine Disney\u2019s next film is going to be a 90 minute political ad for Desantis\u2019 next opponent.This is weird for him cause he knows that our economy here in Florida relies on tourism and Disney happens to be one of the biggest attractions here. Thoroughly confused now.At this point I\u2019m fairly certain that\n1. Disney keeps a large pack of junk yard dogs disguised as lawyers, the kind that get fed live prey on a regular basis to keep their \u2018edge\u2019\n2. They just turned the entire pack loose on Desantis.The Mouse will defeat the ratWill be interesting to see how the conservative judges bend over backwards to explain that things companies say aren't protected by the first amendment, but the money they spend on politicians are.You don\u2019t fuck with the Mouse.So people voted for someone willing to completely tank the economy of his state, wasting taxpayer's money, causing directly the death of children, and get in a lawsuit with the ones controlling one of the biggest sources of revenue of the state.\n\nAll of it so he could harm 1.5% (at most) of the population on a whim.Considering how much of a clown DeSantis has been, the lawyers at Disney will be running circles around anyone he could possibility hire.The real  benefit here is the lawsuit will\nJust be percolating through the judicial system as DeSantis is running for President.  The Democrats should have a field day with his anti business approach and his pettiness.   It\u2019s not going to sway any hard core rights but all those old school republicans will be hard pressed to defend the GOP as a pro business party.  I love it.  Give us more ammo please. \n\nI\u2019m beginning to think neither Trump or DeSantis can get the nomination, let alone win. BHow did the new board overturn they previous board\u2019s actions? I thought they had made that impossible.Outcome depends heavily on how much Ginny Thomas likes to ride Space Mountain.Suddenly I think my refusal to watch anything Disney because of monopolisation was unfounded and I will now binge their entire catalogue and pay for my own subscription \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70I usually don\u2019t root for big corporations but I hope Disney hammers Desantis.Disney and Desantis fighting is like watching two boxers you hate fight just to see them beat the crap out of each other. The house of mouse has done it\u2019s fair share of exploitation and human rights violations, not on the level of the GOP, but Mickey keep some skeletons in his closet too.\u201cHey Norman Michaels! You just won your 500th case, what are you going to do now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Disney World! To discuss their up coming litigation against Governor DeSantis!\u201dNever been a huge fan of the Citizens United SCOTUS decision but in light of that Disney sure has a good argument to make.\n\nWould love to see DeStupid go down on this one, and effectively torpedo his own prez candidate aspirationsJust remember Disney funds republicans to this day. Even DeSantis.Looking at this brief the lawyers have been prepping for the First Amendment case for over a year. They were just waiting for the right action for this lawsuit.Man I hope Disney destroys Florida, everything gone and back to being a swamp. I wouldn't be mad at having Florida be renamed Disney at this pointDisney cites Citizens United!I\u2019m sure the defense of this will be paid in dolphin farts and orange smell and not by any Florida taxpayer money\u2026.Instead of thoughts and prayers I thought I\u2019d get DeSantis something useful. \n\n[Spray for your throat](https://www.biglots.com/product/cherry-sore-throat-spray-6-oz-/p810342879?zcp=pd_pla_go_G_Shopping_Home+Essentials_Groceries_PLA_Div_1_2_est5972&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqcP0-YDI_gIVJ_TjBx2htQrLEAQYASABEgJ8_fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\n[Lube for your ass](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/ideal-animal-health-ob-lube-8-oz-2209781?store=1359&cid=Shopping-Google-Local_Feed&utm_medium=Google&utm_source=Shopping&utm_campaign=&utm_content=Local_Feed&gbraid=0AAAAAD3fmFO3ODIKcup_faUj5DJpOiK7z&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6O-R3oHI_gIVcpVbCh1PewDSEAQYAiABEgKNsPD_BwE)Perfect Ron huh, wasting tax payer dollars. Disney is going to win and then the taxpayers of Florida is going to fit the bill for the government and Disney lawyers. Another win for the taxpayers!Well, it appears that Florida's tax dollars are going to good use...\\*checks notes\\*...over the Governor waging a culture war on the states largest employer then being out maneuvered by said company and trying to save face.I've loved this whole saga of Disney vs DeSantis.Btw everyone, Ron is out of the country right now.  He can't easily access American media to rebut Disney while they romp all over his sorry butt in public.  He's going to try and tell us how much he and Netenyahoo in Israel share a common belief in how to make the world a better place, but all the reporters will be screaming \"Mr. DeSantis, care to comment on the latest whupping you just got from Disney?\"I hope The Mouse takes MoRon down.*Grand Moff Tarkin wearing a Mickey Mouse hat*\n\n\"Fire when ready.\"Oh this is going to be good \ud83c\udf7fDisney has been polite and cordial this entire time. They never spoke out of turn or bad of desantis, besides calling out the don\u2019t say gay law. \n\nDesantis on the other hand has publicly trashed and besmirched Disney\u2019s character the entire time.\n\nDoes desantis enjoy publicly getting his ass kicked? Disney would not have done this if there was a chance at them losing.This has been a terrible year for RepublicansIs not trying to take over a company socialism?Dear Floridians, is the government of your state doing anything useful or is it all just fuck fuck games and trying to get on Fox News?DeSantis is now in the 'find out' stage.Nothing says competent leadership like getting sued by your state's largest employer.DeSantis got married there, this shit is wildDoes a politician\u2019s nonstop war against a beloved place and one of the primary sources of state income lead to winning results in a national election for President?\n\nI\u2019m guessing not.Grind them into fucking mud, Disney. Bankrupt the state and use that money to invest in political ads to save America's penis from the ruin of GOP hands.Disney needs to secede from Florida.Finally, the find out phase.Imagine a timeline where you are hated more than Disney lawyers\u2026. that\u2019s were we are.So the mouse taking off his gloves and about to slap the shit out of Meatball Ron aka Ron DeSanctimoniousRonnie\u2019s about to learn that nobody litigates like the Mouse.yeah, i wouldn't fuck with the mouse's lawyers. Don't think RdS or the state's AG knows what's coming their wayFuck DesantisYou don't just piss off the mouse and it's army of Lawyers and get away with it.Oh my wow, it\u2019s the nominationHw went to the Disney park and saw all these happy people and thought they would be push overs.You don\u2019t fuck with the mouseThis is going to be the legal equivalent of that issue of Punisher MAX where Frank goes full-ass papa bear on Barracuda.\n\nCan't wait.I guess the outgoing board's declarations didn't have any \"significant legal infirmities\" after all because it just dawned on me that the only way Florida was able to get around it was by literally changing the law. Which gave Disney the perfect opportunity to file this suit.\n\nMaybe I'm reading too much into it too soon, but Disney's lawyers seem to have literally thought of every possible thing that DeSantis could do and prepared for it.Paradoxical moments where I love capitalism and moneyPrepare to be fucked by the long dick of the Mouse!Please do a Southpark episode with Mickey Mouse VS DesantisThe question now is, will the Supreme Court ultimately decide to support a Republican Governor, or the Republican values of a free market? What will the Federalist Society and their personal billionaire \u201cfriends\u201d think? Maybe Disney will offer Thomas, Alito, Roberts and the like free annual passes to their themed parks for life and a cameo in the next marvel movie.This is so much bigger than Disney. If DeSantis succeed against Disney don\u2019t think for a second that he won\u2019t continue to abuse his power to go after smaller targets who piss him off. Small businesses and even individuals will all be at risk. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have to like them but as it stands Disney, their money, and their lawyers are the only thing standing between Florida and total authoritarianism under DeSantisThe Mouse lawyers vs DeSantis? My money \ud83d\udcb0 on the MouseLFG Disney.It's going to be very funny to watch Desantis lose this.I'm shocked it took them this long.  They are obviously being specifically targeted by the governor / state of florida b/c of... why?  Because the governor doesn't like what they said.    \n\n\nSo he's using the power of government to demean a single entity.Never thought, I'd side with Disney...Whichever way this lawsuit goes, it will hurt conservatives. If Disney loses, businesses aren\u2019t people. If Disney wins, Desantis loses. Either way, they can\u2019t claim to be pro business anymore (they can, but nobody who is sane will believe them)And there it is. I\u2019m no fan of the megacorp that Disney has become, but they arguably have the best lawyers on the planet.  \n  \nDear Ron - give up now and declare victory to your brain dead followers. Disney lawyers will mop the floor with your ass and laugh the entire time they are doing so.Getting sued by Disney.... I almost feel sorry for DeSantis. Disney's lawyers will find DeSantis into the ground and then pour salt over it so nothing will ever grow there, ever...Does anyone actually know what Ron is trying to accomplish here?\u201cHey kids! How would you all like to take a trip to Desantiland? Where we can see men dressed as men mistreating women dressed as women!\u201dI'm hoping Trumpy gets in on this and piles on DeSantis...\n\n*\"What the hell is Meatball doing?\"*\n\n*\"Does Meatball have a clue how to make a deal?\"*\n\n*\"Little Ron is completely in over his head and is embarrassing himself with this Disney mess. When I'm president, I'll fix this mess that Meatball created.\"*DeSantis will just turn this into a badge of honor but everyone will see it as how weak he is.FightDeSantis truly did fuck around long enough to find out.There\u2019s the Disney we know and fear!You don't fuck with Disney.Only a dumbass voted in by dumbasses would pursue this.  Florida this is what you get. Hurt your number one reason people actually go to your hick state. You don't exist without Disney.Go Disney!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fDeSantis is an idiot that sells the same hate that trump sells!!! He is no angel!Any lawyers here with realistic thoughts of what Desantis\u2019s defense will be? I\u2019m just someone with a masters in strat comm, but I can read the complaint and I don\u2019t see what he could possibly say in legal defense of this.Disney has a really good lawyer tooI keep thinking about the Mickey Mouse in Family Guy.  Anyone else?Um, oh yeah. So focused on the 2nd amendment we forgot about the 1st oneDeSantis is a fucking chode.Im at work and can\u2019t read rn but I\u2019m really out of the loop what has desantis been doing?The Mouse always wins!!!  Best lawyers money can hure.Lmao you come at the mouse, you best not missAll aboard the monorail, we are off to Find Out Land!Imagine being so evil that Disney is actually in the right against youLol troll bots are promoting \u201cReddit is now pro-corporation\u201d. Don\u2019t be a foolMickey: I am the one who knocks.Love to see Disney take steps a business can take \u2026 start cutting Park hours \u2026 Mon-Fri 10AM-5 PM, no alcohol, no local vendors, flex hours only for employees \u2026As was written in the 10 Commandments, \u201cThou shall not fuck with The Mouse.\u201dThis was inevitable. You don't have to be a lawyer to see the tenuous nature of DeSantis' actions, and that of his lackeys. Disney is going to come out of this looking clean, whereas DeSantis is going to look like even more of a fool. What's a shame is that this is a war of two unfair powers - Disney, the oversized corporation and DeSantis, the overinflated ego. \n\nThe loser in this fight is the general public. If public opinion was on DeSantis' side, Disney would have remained silent. Neither DeSantis nor Disney is on the public's side in this debacle. This is all about what is convenient to two powers remaining in power.i'm confused- i thought that Disney had effectively shut all this down a few weeks ago? what is DeSantis trying to do now that's prompting the lawsuit?You don\u2019t fuck with the mouse.You don\u2019t fuck with the Mouse<Insert video of angry and demented Mickey Mouse from South Park here>I'm trying to figure out how I can have babies with an entity/corporation because I really love Disney that much right now. Who knew the law was so much fun.So what happens if they win? Tax payers have to pay?The Mouse needs to stop messing around and just pull stakes, and move to a less zealous State, like North Carolina. That would be a huge warning shot to the GOP that being a religious zealot does not pay. It would also send DeSantis into a politically deadly tailspin for being the man that ran off the State\u2019s biggest employer and bringer of tourist dollars.That\u2019s a misleading title. The reason for the lawsuit is: The company claimed \u201ca targeted campaign of government retaliation,\u201d which it said stemmed from its criticism of a contentious state education law.You just need to read Warren V DeSantis to see how this is going to go. Even if it\u2019s federal, you can\u2019t impose any punitive measures for state agents violating statutory law. \n\nDe Santis knows he isn\u2019t on the hook for any of this.Is Disney really pay no taxes?Well Disney will learn that you can buy land, but the government will always own it.Can they just, I don't know, destroy each other?Pay WallI know DeSantis is the conservative villain du jour, but no matter who wins in a \"battle\" between a rising authoritarian demagogue and a major multi-national corporation, we all lose.So dumb.It is all so we don\u2019t notice what else is happeningPoor, poor Disney. Entitled.I feel like it's going to be very difficult to get past sovereign immunity on this one.Can Disney even afford a lawsuit? They canceled a lot projects and laid off a ton of people recently. I doubt  they have the money to pay their lawyers.I\u2019ve never understood letting Disney have its own actual kingdom.Don't lose sight of the fact that this is just a publicity stunt by the Florida GOP, and who knows?  Maybe even Disney too.  Both are getting a ton of free publicity on this.Of course Disney is suing, over half of Disney is owned by China (Shanghai Shendi Group).\"Mega-Corporations are evil\" mfs when they see a person from a party they don't like:I want DeSantis to win, just so Disney can loseI've heard that Disney World is old and run down now. Long lines and fights breaking out. Plus, they pay their people slave wages. They sleep in their cars.DeSantis the man fr, keeps doing good shit and people are still ignorant enough to hate him \ud83d\ude02. Ignorance is hilarious \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udef5Florida dun fucked up now.Desantis wants one thing only.  To take his act National. Picking a fight with the most popular entertainment distributor in the world was a stupid move to say the least. \n\nI also wonder if he does get that National stage set. What dirt really comes crawling out of his closet.Disney lawyers gonna send DeSatan back to hell where he belongs!Goofy vs. GoofyI\u2019ll put my money on Disney\u2019s lawyers over the tin pot despot DeSantis lackeys.Get fucked RonHis next big plan is going to be to raise the state minimum wage to $30/hr w/o thinking about small businesses. But they never do but say they do.Game.. set.. match.Weeble Ron ignored SCOTUS ruling that Corporations are people and now he has a First Amendment problem on his wobble ass.Prepare to get fucked by the long dick of the happiest place on earth.It is about time. I am not sure why this wasn't the first move.I think they have a pretty solid case.  He's made it crystal clear that their speech was the reason for his actions.Republicans don't seem to grasp that using their power to change the law so that their side gets what it wants is cheating   It's also textbook fascism.He fucked around and now will find out. \n\nI find it ironic that Republicans claim to be the small government party, and to let private businesses be just that, private.\n\n\u2026..I guess that only applies if it is in the best interest of Republicans.Ron fucked around and found out. It\u2019s going to be glorious.Don\u2019t mess with the mouse.> \u201cA company has a right to freedom of speech just like individuals do,\u201d Mr. Iger said at Disney\u2019s annual shareholder meeting this month. \u201cThe governor got very angry over the position Disney took and seems like he\u2019s decided to retaliate against us, including the naming of a new board to oversee the property, in effect to seek to punish a company for its exercise of a constitutional right. And that just seems really wrong to me.\u201d\n\nIt seems wrong to any normal person, yes. Of course. \n\nBut Ron is corrupt as shit and his voters do not care. \n\n... \n\nSo here we are.\\*Michael Jackson popcorn GIF\\*Someone needs to make a Hitler reaction video to this\u201cWait, they can\u2019t punch back!\u201djust leave florida \n\nlet the dummies live in that stateIt isn\u2019t wise to piss off Disney, they\u2019ve only lost once, and that was to Star Wars fans.Who's got more money for lawyers, Disney or the entire state government of Florida? The answer will shock you.There's an old saying in the movie business: The Mouse has very big ears, and even bigger feet. The Mouse has very deep pockets and very short arms.Honestly this is a tough thing because both sides are absolute trash to begin with. Disney shouldn't have had that special tax status to begin plus they are already on mine and many others shit list for thier interference with copyright laws while DeSantis was pulling some actual authoritarian BS that needs to be talked about.Ron deSantis, beaten by a cartoon mouse, classicRepublicans: \"WTF I love government interference in business now!\"[removed]South Park is probably already working on it ... ProbablyDo you know how much a guy has to suck to make me actually want The Mouse to win? I\u2019m so mad right now.American black mirrorThey put it on Disney+\"Ha ha, bend over Ronny, haha\".There is probably Rule34 for you to enjoyjust have to be 18 or older to watch\u2019Stream it on Disney +Please put a NSFW/NSFL tag on this comment.Phrasing?No need for discovery when your opponent helpfully puts all the pertinent details in his memoir.page 68 quoting an article by deSantis to promote his book\n\n\"When corporations try to use their economic power to advance a woke agenda, they become political, and not merely economic actors...\n\nLeaders must stand up and fight back when big corporations make the mistake, as Disney did, of using their economic might to advance apolitical \\[sic\\] agenda.\"\n\nhmm sounds a little like this might be retaliation.I had to get popcorn while reading.  This is a good brief.>There is no room for disagreement about what happened here: Disney expressed its opinion on state legislation and was then punished by the State for doing so.\n\nOh this is good stuff.That was a beautiful read. Desantis is f'd lol. Thanks for posting.Oh god I never knew a briefing could make me feel such pleasure.>like any other landowner/resident\n\nPretty sure landowners and residents are not the same thing. Residents vote. Landowners do not. And corporations are not residents.we\u2019re fighting for free speech! Disney is on the right side on this one.Disney will pay for the best lawyers.Agree, I am super excited to see the day that governments finally stand up to corporations. We need them to pay fair wages, have proper regulations in place to protect our planet and have them pay their fair share of taxes. \n\nWhat I don't want is governments to attack corporations as a vendetta or out of spite.Yeah. This corporate owned town always seemed dodgy to me.  Like mining company towns.  Even if people are treated ok. \n\nBut compared to the government deciding to target a business for saying something?  That seems more dangerous to me.DeSantis did what many thought was impossible and that's getting the dems on the side of a corporation xDWe are not rooting for the mega crop. We are rooting to protect our free speech rights and preventing them from expanding this farther. \n\nImagine if instead of punishing Disney instead they do this to punish you or prevent you from working. Speak out against the government no police protection for you or your kids are banned from going to school.  This is to prevent us from turning into China with their social capital ranking bs. \n\nFor all the GOP complaining about China they sure as hell are acting like China\u2019s leaders.In my head is the comic that has Joker vs. the Red Skull.  \n\nYeah, no heroes here, but there's villains and there's **VILLAINS**.>I\u2019d be rooting for a megacorporation\n\nNo one else is surprised.we really do live in the weirdest timeline.I'm rooting for neither, but it's nice when rich assholes fight each other for a change instead of putting all their energy to screwing over regular people.Opposing Fascism makes for strange bedfellows.The enemy of my enemy I guessWhat about side by side with a friend?I wonder which franchise profit they\u2019ll tap for this? Or maybe all of them like rainbow sherbet.\n\nEither way, doesn\u2019t look good for DeSantis.I had a [fun time](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12t75pc/disney_tells_its_lobbyists_to_step_up_fight/jh1fu3u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) last week trying to explain to some people how megacorps don\u2019t stop being evil even when you\u2019re rooting for them against a worse evilAnd it's Disney!  It's not the same as IBM or Prudential going after them.You want 1984 or Brave New World?\n\nDeSantis and Disney fighting is like a wolf fighting a fox.\n\nYou're still the rabbit.kick his ass, seabass!(me watching them fight)\n\nGood, good. Let the anger flow through you.They cited DeSantis\u2019 own stupid book. Where DeSantis discusses moves made in secret to harm Disney. To paraphrase The Wire: \u201cGovernor, is you publishing notes on a criminal fucking conspiracy?\u201dWhoever crafted that filing earned thier money.Specifically the \u201cweaponizing of government\u201d.Dude just the table of contents writes the article. It\u2019s phenomenal.This was a jaw dropping read, thanks for sharing. Disney is gonna wipe the floor with this fool.Ugh..  Orlando didn't vote for our village idiot governor.\n\nHowever, they are doing their best to show the nation he is a huge POSReally exciting to see if the Supreme Court would revert back to ww1 definition of free speech.I mean he did it to himself he should've just left it alone \nPeople wanna be woke let em be woke\nGovernment shouldn't interfere with what people want to do with their lives and if it's a danger to children so they say then they are the shitty parents for allowing their children near that stuff \n\nDesantis is the dictionary definition of a fascist tbhCan\u2019t wait for the Disney+ doc!Stir Crazy style or whirly pop with flavacol and oil....movie theater goodtimes.Disney have that covered at their parks.\n\nYou can even get a special refillable bucket!Seriously, going after a company that A) is the largest taxpayer ($1.2 **billion** last year) in the entire state; B) employs 75,000+ people; and C) has a legal team that shits gold on the daily is *incredibly* short-sighted. I don\u2019t know how he expects this to bolster his chances for presidency. They\u2019re going to eat him alive.And all of this is for naught because Trump will hit him with more hilarious second grade insults and that's the end of DeMeatballThe people of Florida don\u2019t care. They wanted this.  They voted overwhelmingly for DeSantis.Narrator: He missedMy brother once's threatened to hit my grandmother, a woman from the deep hollers of east KY. She just took a drag off her cigarette and said, in a whisper 'i love you boy, but you hit me, you better kill me'I fucking get itthat means disney is going to be taken down suddenly an unexpectedly by a small childThat ship may have already sailed.you know - it doesn't even need the most expensive.  it is pretty cut and dry here.It buys Wilmer Hale and O\u2019Melveny.Oh, Disney\u2019s legal team wouldn\u2019t sue unless they had a 100% chance of winning. You gotta give it to them, they are great at entertaining.Disney waited  so they could sue in Federal court instead of State court where DeSantis could exert pressure on the judge.>Likely to be locked in court for years and DeSantis won\u2019t even be around\n\nThis is probably how it'll play out. DeSantis will continue to bluster about how he's taking on the woke corporations. A bunch of money will be spent on lawyer for the next several years, and then it'll all just quietly go away when the next governor takes office.> Likely to be locked in court for years\n\nDisney is looking for injunctive relief, so they can have the courts stop Meatball Ron aka Mr. Pudding Fingers right in his tracks until the case gets to the courthouse.> And they are absolutely correct.\n\nMeatball Ron aka Mr. Pudding Fingers admitted to it on TV and in his stupid book. Open and shut case.Feels like the Dominon lawsuit against Fox was the start. But I say keep it going, these fuckers will only listen once it affects their walletsRight? A LOT of the threats sounded like restrictions on Disney's freedom of speech. No quotes needed around the phrase and no /s... because Republicans.He is a dipshit. Dumb as bricks.Some teenagers really like to film their crimes and post them to social media.  DeSantis is a bit older, so he had to settle for publishing them in a book instead.My god, there are tapes. And by tapes, I mean a book with his name on it.Disney had to wait until DeSantis did something blatantly unconstitutional, like trying to cancel a contract that was validly entered.\n\nThe board members that he appointed voted to do that this morning. Disney\u2019s lawyers filed the lawsuit minutes later.There wasn\u2019t that big a rush. Desantis was digging deeper.  Not a lawyer but my guess is there will be a motion for an injunction pretty soon.  \n\nThe actual trial for this will be a year or more away.  Just guessing.I imagine it\u2019s like shoplifters. Let them keep doing stupid shit until you can go after them for it all at once.My guess is that they wanted to build the case of an organized campaign against them, rather than 1 or 2 occurrences. More of a solid case to show intent and malice.\n\nDisney was likely more than willing to take a few lumps and leave it at that, if DeSantis only went so far.Disney tried to give the governor a win with the board take-over crap. They passed the contract before to ensure the board had no real power. Instead of DeSantis leaving it be with taking over the board as a win he decides to keep pushing it to the point their only option is a lawsuit.No, Trump is just publicly going after the Federal Judge in his NYC rape case, judge told Trump knock it off or I will incarcerate you on Federal contempt of court charges. Odds Trump can exercise self discipline on social media are poor\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fI don\u2019t understand how today\u2019s GOP, which continually shifts to the right, actually think they can be competitive on a national level ever again. I mean, their core base isn\u2019t getting younger either. I don\u2019t want to be overconfident but unless they hash out some fresh and effective rebrand this iteration of the GOP may never win another presidential election ever.Classic example of rules for thee, none for me.That is some vicious 5-D spite chess right there.No settlement to be had here. They are not seeking financial compensation. What disney needs here is a legal precedent set confirming their rights, any payment would mean nothing to them by comparison. They are a 176 billion dollar corporation.Disney Super PAC with access to all of their IP.  Just stupidly well made political ads with a bunch of Disney characters and music.  If they decide to go all in, it will be an interesting time.What would happen if they just left the state?They can\u2019t avoid it. Disney specifically cites Citizens United in the lawsuit. It\u2019s either corporations have first amendment rights (can donate unlimited money to campaigns) or they don\u2019t.They overturned it by completely ignoring existing law.They did.  Legally.Ronda Scrotus has already torpedoed his Prez ambitions. He\u2019s fucked up so badly in this, and a number of other areas that he\u2019s unelectable nationwide. Trump will rip him a new asshole for weeks, and Ronda can\u2019t respond because he can\u2019t declare a candidacy for Prez because he\u2019d have to resign as Floriduuuh\u2019s governor. Ronda is fucked six ways from sunday and he\u2019s barely aware of it yet.The irony is if DeSantis wins this case it\u2019s possible that companies will no longer be able to give unlimited donations to political campaigns.The mouse is getting laid soon \ud83d\ude2dTerrible for America. Great for the Republicans.Florida like many other red stars is heavily gerrymandered.Second largest.  Publix has more florida employeesThe mouse has deep pockets along with an army of attorneys.Disney has more money and better lawyers. That\u2019s never a good competition to walk in to.They we\u2019re letting it play out. The first round was designed to piss him off, and set up a situation that would undercut every HOA in Florida if they went that way\u2026 this one is the first \u201ccause\u201d they have.  It\u2019s chess\u2026Just respond that Biden raised the minimum corporate tax to 15% for all corporations, DeSantis so far has accomplished nothing besides wasting tax payer money paid to his friends law firm.Illegally void the contract that shut everything down.In February, Florida legislators ended Disney\u2019s long-held ability to self-govern its 25,000-acre resort as if it were a county. Last week, Gov. DeSantis announced plans to subject Disney to new ride inspection regulations. Then on Wednesday, Disney filed its complaint minutes after a board newly appointed by DeSantis to oversee government services at Disney World voted to nullify two agreements that gave Disney vast control over expansion at the resort complex.   \n\n\nFor more context, [here\u2019s some background](https://www.nytimes.com/article/disney-florida-desantis.html?unlocked_article_code=0K4F1TeGOwPFdMgJv9npR8bIxwahmZxHSeov6aWcmUmWRWJB12ir0oqVUQxFez9V5eI-8u8QDfhH__UQq2ff-ul0txN94lxiStjx-6g7o98GTPTrIPl3E6Xez2nXuZj9g1U9rhScXTZ0n3DrK-i_gN4U3-FwB5KgmymPS07ahss0xXdETa406a5VhSMHPpSQaAkgmOXFZ8VDurjIzOihBhW3E1_-rsNZHXFlZN7M4QsaWrOGDGGle9TG0nQIDmiiwSFeUtyjCNFGNuZ9wUIrVKuKugW17-GzdX8OSb7_bJEMS0Ek8vbhJjLu8vxiDUzambfcTeUO6w&smid=re-nytimes) on the yearlong dispute (a free gift link).

Why should they care now?Never, ever going to happen. It would cost them billions.I see a lot of people suggesting this, and it seems they just don't understand the full scale of Walt Disney World. \n\nIt's not just a park, like a Six Flags or something like that. It even dwarfs something like Universal Studios in its sheer scale.\n\nIt's more comparable to a moderate sized city, with all the infrastructure that implies. There's literally no way to just \"pull stakes\", any more than it would be feasible to just move an entire city from one place to another.Not really, if you read the full complaint they are asking the court to declare the entire state takeover unenforceable.For what it\u2019s worth Disney cites that case in this complaint.NoThe issue is that a governor of an entire state is using his power to attack a company because that company said something against his policy.Sovereign immunity doesn\u2019t apply to constitutional violations as alleged in the lawsuit.Lmao, you're kidding right? Disney has like 9 billion cash on hand, their total value is equal to like 20 percent of Florida's GDP, im sure they can afford to sue little Ronny D.Disney could get the best to do this Pro Bono.  Not only that they definitely have their own law firm at the readyI'm sure they can scrap together enough money with the 20 or so billion they have in cash on hand...Serious? They are one of the biggest companies in the world. Of course they can afford a lawsuit.>I doubt  they have the money to pay their lawyers.\n\nwhat? why would that be the case? they are literally one of the largest companies in the world. Disney is fine.\n\n>Net income was $1.28 billion, or 70 cents a share, compared with $1.1 billion, or 60 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 8% to $23.51 billion from $21.82 billion a year ago. A bright spot for Disney came from its parks, experiences and products divisions, which saw a 21% increase in revenue to $8.7 billion during the most recent quarter.   \n\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/disney-dis-earnings-q1-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/disney-dis-earnings-q1-2023.html)Disney is not the only one that has this type of arrangement.The Villages retirement community has dozens of special districts. \n\nhttps://districtgov.org/departments/Purchasing/certificates.aspx#:~:text=The%20Village%20Community%20Development%20Districts,exempt%20from%20Florida%20sales%20tax.\n\nThere's over 1800 in Florida. Why does Disney bother you?The land that Disney is located on was all swamp. It took a lot of money to build up the area. Not all the land is Disney's some of it is public. So government services needed to be set up and infrastructure needed built. The special district issues government bonds to pay for the upgrades to the area as well as other government services. The district then taxes Disney to pay for the bonds. This way the two neiboring counties do not have to pay for the upgrades or government services provided in the district.  There are several special districts throughout Florida. The Big retirement community called The Villages is another famous one.There are more complete explanations but short answer, it saves taxpayers money. They control the area they own 2/3rds of and pay their own way as far as upkeep/upgrades.Disney neither needs nor wants publicity like this. They don't want to be on any \"side\" that they don't have to be. DeSantis, yes, although I don't think it's going to work out like he expects.Definitely not a publicity stunt from Disney, they don't need it.  It's a message from Disney to anyone else that tries to step over the line and fuck with them legally.  Disney gets a lot of crap for how they go after people with their lawyers but it's all to set a precedent.What\u2019s a better policy to lessen the power of large corporations, Biden\u2019s minimum corporate tax for all large corporations or DeSantis\u2019s publicity stunt to pay his lawyer friends with Florida tax payer money?Rooting for big government and against Freedom of Speech, that\u2019s a bold strategy Cotton let\u2019s see how that plays out.What does this have to do with Florida\u2019s state government infringing on Disney\u2019s 1st amendment rights and their violation of laws against contract nullification???I wouldn't say old and run down, they keep it looking decent, but I have heard horror stories about the way they treat employees... But what else is new for a billion dollar corporation. Really makes me lose hope in society.It's run down and cheap looking by the standards Disney established for themselves, still better looking than any theme/amusement park in the U.S. \n\nEfteling in Netherlands surpassed Disney years agoMinimum wage at Disney is $17/hour.Poster child for dunning-kruger.What good shit has he done? Florida is literally the laughing stock of the United States. Nobody with any sort of a brain is taking anything he does seriously.Would you be so kind as to explain what \"good shit\" he's done?>DeSantis the man fr, keeps doing good shit and people are still ignorant enough to hate him \n\n\"good shit\" like what, exactly? targeting the largest job creator in the state? lying about taxpayers not having a voice when the boards hes appointing are appointed without us having a voice in it? how about his attempt to pretend high school students arent mature enough to hear about gay people existing, yet mature enough to enlist in the military?The man couldn\u2019t even win the Republican primary right now. Even with his fancy high heel boots he isn\u2019t much of a man.Yep it is is. Buuuut then again we do live in a sinful world so the opposition is excepted.Good shit meaning abusing executive power and attacking our constitutional rights?Well they\u2019re not suing Florida. Just DeSantis himself.No it won't disney is a world wide business with billions if not trillions of dollars to spend. Florida is a cheap pos state to live in.\u201cEspecially when they interfere with one of the state\u2019s largest employers and source of revenue!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s as if they weren\u2019t sure what happened when they shot one foot, so they decided the logical next step was to shoot the other.They're not happy over on r/conservative today. According to them, former presidents and active governors are above being able to be suedRepublicans: \"Laissez-life's-not-fair, can't awoken me\"Don\u2019t you dare try to limit poisons in the air, ground or water. Also you better not interfere with safety, health, pay or labor standards.\n\nBut we will destroy your company if you dare disagree with us about anything.Florida to Fox News: Hold my beer...>Conservatism, then, is not a commitment to limited government and liberty\u2014or a wariness of change, a belief in evolutionary reform, or a politics of virtue. These may be the byproducts of conservatism, one or more of its historically specific and ever-changing modes of expression. But they are not its animating purpose. Neither is conservatism a makeshift fusion of capitalists, Christians, and [culture] warriors, for that fusion is impelled by a more elemental force\u2014the opposition to the liberation of men and women from the fetters of their superiors, particularly in the private sphere. Such a view might seem miles away from the libertarian defense of the free market, with its celebration of the atomistic and autonomous individual. But it is not. When the libertarian looks out upon society, he does not see isolated individuals; he sees private, often hierarchical, groups, where a father governs his family and an owner his employees. -- Corey Robin, *The Reactionary Mind*\n\n\"Conservative Values\" are simply reactionary tactics.I know it won\u2019t happen, but imagine if Florida Republicans accidentally un-did the CU ruling.Do you mean a ruling on Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co?> Citizens United\n\nisn't Citizens United about MONEY being speech?\n\nthis case is about actual speech from a company being protected speech under the first amendment.This 100% what I think it'll come down to. Accidentally laying the groundwork for a repeal.They can still churn out a new episode, writing room to broadcast within days, correct?Definitely, no probablyIf Mr. Garrison became the Trump of South Park, who will be the show's DeSantis?Perfect!\u201cOh boy!\u201dCool so I wasn't the only one thinking \"wtf he really admitted that it his 'memoir'\"?Right?! I was looking at the footnotes of the lawsuit and how they were citing the memoir. It\u2019s basically a written confession!! I feel sorry for the person whose job was to read that rag of a bookNot to mention I don't remember the part of the first amendment that says the government can't restrict your speech unless you're petitioning said government for a redress of grievances.My favorite parts are Desantis\u2019 book being used against him. This dude is going to score multiple own goals with it.It is. \n\nDare I say I felt a small, tiny, miniscule glimmer of....pride....when reading it. Ugh. That feels weird to say lol. \n\nPride in Disney Corp...wow. What a timeline this is!Whoever crafted this deserves a raise.The supreme court ruled differently on the matter.> Landowners do not.\n\nMy HOA would beg to differ with you.  \n\nResidents do not vote in electing the board, landowners vote.  \n\nThis is part of Reedy Creek District Covenants that DeSantis threw away that has been upheld by the Florida Supreme Court (Page 32, Section 90 of the brief)Oh believe me I know.  I just find it funny that this is what 2023 has come to.  Same as how I\u2019m actually rooting for pharmaceutical companies against the abortion pill and trans healthcare bans.  This country is so messed up now that these billion dollar companies are actually in the right, that they\u2019re fighting against fascists.  Who\u2019d have thought?Wow, thanks satan!I\u2019m rooting for Disney to take down the supervillain known as DeathSantisI mean, you're right, it just feels weird that a megacorp is on the right side of, well, anything really...It\u2019s important to be consistent with rights and laws. Even if you don\u2019t *like* a person or entity you still have to give them the rights they\u2019re entitled to as well as treat them fairly under the law. Having rights or laws is pointless if you can arbitrarily ignore them because you have a personal grudge against the target. It sets a bad precedent. This is so much more important than Disney. If DeSantis succeeds in going after Disney for free speech then don\u2019t think for a second he won\u2019t abuse his power to go after smaller targets who piss him off.Kind of ironic that a corporation completely devoid of any type of creativity is the one defending our creative freedom. I'll take it but it's funny.Will pay? They *do* pay, lol. Their (former) general counsel was literally the top paid in the country at $6.7M and they have over 350 in-house attorneys.\n\nhttps://attorney-faq.com/attorney-who-have-worked-with-disneyYou have to go to 40k for a word describing the war crimes Disney\u2019s lawyers are about to commit:  exterminatus.It\u2019s a \u201ccorporate owned\u201d town that had almost no residents though. I think that\u2019s quite a bit different than the old company towns owned and operated by mining companies and factories.What I think will be interesting, and will play out in this trial, is that Disney's corporate \"city\" is not unique. There are many others in Florida, including The Villages. But that is a GOP stronghold and of course, Desantis hasn't mentioned stripping them of THEIR rights.>But compared to the government deciding to target a business for saying something?  That seems more dangerous to me.\n\nProgressive defending corporate speech. I wish y'all though that when big blue cities like [Chicago](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/chick-fil-blocked-opening-chicago-store/story?id=16853890) and [Boston](https://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/23/boston-mayor-blocks-chick-fil-a-franchise-from-city-over-homophobic-attitude/) tried to ban Chick Fil A because they didn't share the values of those cities.The people who identify as liberal democrats usually have little issue aligning with corporations. It is those of us further to the left who are more likely to be anti-corporation. As many have said, we may not like the taste of it, but we will swallow the pill of Disney fighting back against this bullshit being peddled by the Florida GOP and smile about it.He's too goddamn stupid to have the floor!And when DeSantis loses, the good people of Florida will pay the legal fees. What a great way to spend money...7000/hr no lessIt seems like he doesn\u2019t even care if it hurts businesses in Orlando. It\u2019s such a weird, petty feud to have with himself. Disney can exist without Florida, Florida will have a tough time attracting floods of tourists without Disney. If I were considering development/investing in Florida right now, I\u2019d think again. Not great to have to worry that your business could get targeted and punished for your beliefs, which is exactly what they\u2019re always whining about.Using government power to punish an area filled with voters who didn't vote for him was probably icing on the cake for him when he started this.I want DeSantis to be played by Laverne Cox>\tI don\u2019t know how he expects this to bolster his chances for presidency. They\u2019re going to eat him alive.\n\nI\u2019m guessing his plan was to campaign in getting \u201cwoke corporations\u201d to fall in line. Now he\u2019s publicly getting his shit pushed in by one.His fight with Disney has already stsrted to hurt hjs chances for the presidency. The guy's ego is almost as big as Trump's and he is just as stupid.It's in a state's interest to have good relations with their large employers.It's not like he bragged about strong arming Disney in said presidential run book he just wrote, and they're using his actual words against him. \n\nOh, wait...\n\nInvest in popcorn futures, folks.Love it.Ya, my pro-trump, (previously also pro-desantis) coworkers in Florida have already started straying away from Desantis. Which is wild because they still support trump but I guess I\u2019ll take the wins we canThey already have the the best lawyers. And they will pay them with the money which would otherwise be campaign contributions.The icing: they are suing for atty fees/costs too, so this is going to cost a LOT for FL . YikesI don't even know what's scarier than the Mouse's legal team. Nintendo might be close? Probably not?Maybe he (or his wife - what happened to the money in her hurricane fund) will just grift his supporters for $$ for his lawsuits like Trump does.taxpayer money for Floridians\u2026.Not \"corporations\"  lawsuit spells out it was a single corporation.But will a federal judge actually punish them for it. Not punish the state... punish THEM, every Legislator that voted teams on the laws, personally... disqualifying them from immunity as government officials.  \n\nLet Disney sue THEM for tens of millions.The only question is how many knots will Clarence \"Free Commercial Speech\" Thomas will tie himself in trying to side against Disney.I said a while ago that anyone who thinks a company as big as Disney doesn't have it's muscles tensed, ready to pounce on the first sign of weakness must not understand how these behemoths operate.\n\nOddly (and, for once, satisfyingly), it's Republicans who've given them all this power. I mean... did they not realize that Disney doesn't \"hire\" lawyers, Disney \"has\" lawyers... like tons of them? On payroll? At all times?\n\nWhy would they imagine a company like Disney has an enormous legal apparatus in the first place? And what did they think would happen if some idiot rogue fascist Governor went after them like this?This.  \n\nDisney had the right to do what they did in the previous board.  Hopefully they also go after DeSantis for their right to vote for local representation.I'm willing to bet that they've had the bones of this lawsuit written up for a while now.It wasn't a win though. It was a humiliation. He got the board, but the board was put in a rubber room and handed a playskool gavel. Then it was made public and he was dragged in the news cycle. This escalation is a bully willing to cut of his nose to spite his face.Yeah, I'm sure trump totally planned out appointing judges in Florida so they can side against Rhonda santis when Disney comes after himEveryone keeps saying this, but they literally would never leave the state unless it\u2019s over something super extreme, which is why Desantis has been pushing this so much to act like a tough guy, he knows they\u2019re stuck. The cost to rebuild that park would be insane and in the billions. It\u2019s easier for them just to wait for this to blow over after the presidential run, or to challenge him in court\n\n\nThough I\u2019m not sure if he planned on their lawyers embarrassing him constantly.FlirtMcDudes comment is basically what I was gonna say. I like what DeSantis does in terms of handling Florida, but if he's gonna act like a prick to someone like Disney, what's stopping him from acting like that with small businessesShould have guessed it was the most simple answer. Fascism 101.My dude.  They are already on a side.  Fox News and other right wing media outlets have been pushing \"Disney is turning our kids gay\" propaganda for a long time now.  I attend a Southern Baptist church where \"Disney is a Satanic organization\" is a regular talking point among many in the congregation.  \n\nWhether or not Disney wanted this I don't know, but they are definitely on a side.Idk im js the mass turnaround to suck Disney's cock is insaneNothing. But Disney is a shitty company. That's well-known. They also ruined Star Wars.You are proving my point lmao, also California is the laughing stock of America by a long shot \ud83d\udc80Yes, what was it that Jesus said about a sinful world?\n\nLet he is who is laden with sin cast the first stone, then everyone follow? Only love thy neighbor when they follow your interpretation of the Torah? I'm dead and Paul the Pharisee is totally legit, and you will only know this through Paul's words alone as he continues to act like a Pharisee?Yea it is unfortunate but can\u2019t be helped I suppose, there will always be sheep following the Shepards.You are thinking of the democratsWhats really going to kill deSantis in this is discovery. No legal expert but think it would be well within Disney's rights to get communications between deSantis and the Florida legeslative. Is anyone confident that those communications are squeaky clean? This could easily expand to a whole different can of worms for little Ron.What appendage will they shoot next - they got lots of ammoThis is one of the biggest conundrums lolSeriously, I\u2019m ashamed of what\u2019s happening to our political partiesYou give them too much credit.  According to them, only former REPUBLICAN presidents and active REPUBLICAN governors are above being able to be sued.  \n\nThey will be totally happy to try and sue Biden when he leaves office.im convinced they are never actually happy over there. simply perpetually triggeredR/conservative also hit the story with their favorite free speech tag\u2026 \u2018flavored users only\u2019\n\nTheir MODS know how stupid they sound, but they also know that they must protect their safe space.God.  I couldn\u2019t read more than 3 minutes worth of that garbage before I vomited.  Those poor people are so delusional.\"Disney is mad because they had a special deal no one else had and FL is cancelling it! Entitlements! What do you mean FL has over 1k special districts that weren't touched?\"\u201cLaw and order!!!\u201d*\n\n* except for usTexas Governor Greg Abbott once joked that he had the easiest job in the world when he was the state's AG. All he had to do was go to work, sue the Obama administration for something and then go home.Plz do go look over at the subs position on this matter. Because for the most part they agree with Disney.Bud lite...no thanks  !SCOTUS is so illegitimate that they would probably rule in Florida\u2019s favor and declare it only applies in this instance.>isn't Citizens United about MONEY being speech?\n\nNo, this was Buckley v Valeo in 1976.Yes they are incredible fast. I believe it was a weekLast time I checked, yeahMr HatBarbradyNo you misunderstood, that means you have to pay politicians massive campaign contributions in secret. Then you're just being an economic player not a political one.I know right.  They directly quote him and his book soo many times.  It is like he wants to be the best player on Disney's team.Yep. Residents don't lose their rights just because they've come together as a group.Fair enough, what was the case/ruling? Never heard of landowners or corporations casting a ballot. Maybe they have other official mechanisms though.It\u2019s because the unholy alliance of Big Business and the social conservatives under the GOP banner is finally breaking down. \n\nAmerican society is undeniably moving further left on social issues and the businesses are just following the cash to be made by supporting those stances. However, social conservatives are some of the most important parts of the GOP base. They know they\u2019re losing the culture wars and are lashing out. Hurting their own political partners in the process. The Religious Right is starting to be bad for business and eventually the GOP is going to have to pick a side. They\u2019re between a rock and a hard place.Because they're fighting fascists. The world had a way of dealing with fascists back in the 30s and 40s, should have never let them get the kind of power they have right nowIt still comes down to us\u2026 while it sucks that here\u2019s where we are, we are effectively voting with our wallets. It\u2019s our choice to not support brands f promoting hate.Let\u2019s be realistic: they\u2019re fighting fascists because fascists are cutting into their bottom line. As soon as these fascists give the corporations a financial reason to back them, they will.90% of what happens in the world/news, if you'd told me 10 years ago the world would be like this, I'd have thought it was some weird off the wall joke or satire. \n\nSadly satire isn't funny in real lifeBecause mega corporations are the only ones with the ability/money to fight this bullshit. When we get our rights taken away we can\u2019t do shit about it usually but now these corporations have rights and are considered people more than actual fucking people are it\u2019s absurd. Go Disney thoThese rabid government fascists need to be put in their place.Did you mean to write Bill instead of Pill there?I wouldn't exactly throw Disney to devoid of any type of creativity. They sell the same stories over and over, but they're certainly not devoid of creativity, just suppressors of the same.Oh. My god. Their in house counsel department is bigger than most law firms.I was wondering what their in house legal looked like! I assumed it was a few hundred in house and hundreds more support, based on having worked for Qualcomm a company that is also focused on ip. Thank you for informing me. I don\u2019t think people understand these companies have their own internal law firms, their oc is just the person public facing there is an entire army behind.Yeah I\u2019m sure it\u2019s way different than the old company towns, but I\u2019ve never been sanguine about it.  Would you be ok of Nestle started buying towns?\n\nI don\u2019t think I would be.  That doesn\u2019t mean Disney\u2019s case is necessarily bad but I worry I\u2019m being hypocritical.  \n\nTake it this way. I would have been fascinated if Florida decided it was against corporate ownership of towns and went after Disney for that reason.  It would have taken me a while watching to form an opinion. \n\nThis case of we\u2019re going after you for what you said bugs me. \n\nAnother commenter asked if I was consistent when Boston wanted to ban chick fil a.  I can\u2019t remember what I thought at the time.[Here](https://theintercept.com/2023/02/18/deconstructed-podcast-the-villages-florida/) is a great article about how some residents of the Villages tried to run for county commission seats to fight a 25% property tax increase. The tax increase was going to subsidize the owner of the Villages further expansion, not benefit the residents already there. DeSantis ended up putting his thumb on the scale to help the owner get his way. It\u2019s all pathetic. \n\nI wonder if Disney can use this example of preferential treatment to businesses that are good donors and toe the party line in regards to the governor.Those cities shouldnt ban the companies for their view; those mayors are wrong. However if they are doing something discriminatory, then it can be justifiable. That being said idk much bout Chick Fil A, i eat at Popeyes.Dude, what? From almost a decade ago?\n\nYou realize that both Boston and Chicago have Chik fil a, right?\n\n[https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations?locationsearch=boston&menuItem=](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations/ma/copley-square-in-line)\n\n[https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations?locationsearch=chicago&menuItem=](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations?locationsearch=chicago&menuItem=)\n\nFind a more current talking point, Fox let you down on this one.To tell the truth I was working crazy hours during the Chick Fil A. Traveling half the time and trying to catch up the other half.  I\u2019d be lying if I said I remember exactly what I thought.  \n\nI didn\u2019t like their social positions  I\u2019d be lying if I said I was against the cities banning them because I don\u2019t remember.  \n\nNearest I can come is I thought it was dumb for NY to ban big sodas but that\u2019s different isn\u2019t it.Doubt it. Top talent at Big Law right now is in the $1500-2000 range.He doesn't care. It's just about his national ambitions at this point. He's done with Florida. He's barely in the state; off campaigning on the taxpayer's dime.Gaslight  \nObstruct  \n***Project***The oversight board this meeting said they would have to raise taxes on businesses to pay for legal fees coming from their shenanigans.It\u2019s a dick measuring contest.  He\u2019s having a dick measuring contest with a mouse.Doubt he\u2019d be doing it if they did vote for himMindy KailingShe\u2019s too pretty to play DesantitsAlready started? Have you seen cable news lately? They\u2019re all running stories promoting Trump as the clear nominee over DeSantis. This shit is over for him, none of the media companies actually *want* someone in power over them that has shown he will target them for their disobedience.The two people you don't mess with in this world are The Mouse and The Plumber.No. Disney\u2019s attorneys are the scariest. They\u2019ve freaking changed copyright law for decades.Oh no, it is the consequences of my actions.Majority of voters voted for DeSantis, while 46.4% of eligible voters didn't bother to vote. Sounds like a them problem.Disney's speech was SPEECH. CU is about corporate donations, none of that has to do with this case.  Disney put out a few strongly worded Press Releases.. that's all they did.>Disney \"has\" lawyers... like tons of them? On payroll? At all times?\n\nthey literally have floors of lawyersThey certainly do have lawyers on staff, but that complaint is signed by two big names, one of which is the most liberal firm in the top 20, plus a boutique local firm. They\u2019re coming out swinging, hard.It was submitted within MINUTES of their contract being voided. Disney set a trap, and had the lawsuit ready to go the second their contract was voided.Certainly but they are the ones that made it public.  If the board and DeSantis shut up no one would have known he lost.I meant the choice Disney made in choosing that venue for their lawsuit.They can halt construction projects, postpone Imaginears relocations (done), reprioritize spending to other non-Florida parks, and even adjust advertising dollars to other parks. Those things have an economic impact on the central Florida economy. If the statement, \"It's time for us to reinvest in our Disneyland parks\" were done publicly, that could be huge.$5 Billion to move the park... or we could just see what DeSantis's opponent does with $100 Million and the help of a Super PAC run by Disney with access to Disney IP.\n\nPAC not pact\"I attend a Southern Baptist church where \"Disney is a Satanic organization\" is a regular talking point among many in the congregation.\" -- not_that_planet\n\nIt's so weird that Southern Baptists would call any organization \"satanic\" after the SBC got caught up in a pedophile scandal. And the reason the Southern Baptists exist today is because they wanted to own slaves so they broke away from their original church that was against slavery. And now the SBC is expelling churches with women pastors. Yep totally normal and not at all culty.Then maybe Florida should hold them accountable for being a shitty company instead of attacking their 1st amendment freedoms for holding opinions that hurt Rhonda\u2019s feelings.\n\nUnfortunately, defending workers rights isn\u2019t exactly in the GOP\u2019s wheelhouse so I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath.Uuum what the hell are you talking about. Im not even talking about the torahI mean yeah lol thats literally the favorite sport of humans. To follow instead of thinking and choosing for onslefI'm not gonna lie, i fully expect a coverup on desantis' side. Missing emails, lost archives, \"I don't recall\"s.Say what you will about Donald Trump, but he nailed DeSantis by calling him \"Meatball Ron\"If you read the complaint which, I don\u2019t suggest anyone do although it was entertaining, they have an incredible amount of information from public statements not just ron but in legislature. Their case was basically made for them completely in the open. And the bits from Ron\u2019s book lol. Incredible complaint. I wonder if they let an associate draft it because it\u2019s just too obvious.I think they'll likely determine those communications to be privileged for security or some other BSFlorida taxpayers are going to be thrilled by millions and millions of their hard earned tax dollars being spent on lawyers and governor staff attempting to justify Ron DeNastis' ridiculous culture war.Maybe once they do it to a certain other limb they\u2019ll be able to relate to trans people and stop being so transphobic.Here\u2019s a hint: it\u2019s Florida-shaped.Look what they did to AbbottParties?A wild BothSides appearsHonest to God I'm shocked they haven't tried to impeach Biden yet. For what, who the heck knows, but I'm sure they could make up some BS.They're always upset over there about something. I got banned after one comment pointing out them being hypocrites.  I jistblike to pop over every now and again to see what trivial thing has their blood boiling currently.They're moderately happy when they see people suffer, but yeah, other than that, there's nothing resembling joy in their lives and they're animated almost exclusively by their resentments and embitterment.My favorite take over there is \"if the government gives you stuff it's not legal to say things the government doesn't like and therefore you should lose all rights granted by the government including protections for things like, you know, speech and stuff under the law.\"\u2018Excuse me while I drive my golf cart back to my condo in The Villages\u2019 seriously tho with that many special districts I had to wonder wait how much of florida does florida govern? I mean don\u2019t get me wrong ANY amount is too much\u2026I looked over there and the current stance appears to be you can't sue the government for retaliation as long as it's done legally.\n\nLike wtf? Do they not know almost every law struck down for being unconstitutional was originally passed legally?I don't think we looked at the same thread then lolI don\u2019t know, they\u2019ve had a habit of ruling in favor of corporate interests. Wonder if they\u2019re going to back their employers or their ideology.Yep, just like they did in 2000 when they handed the GOP the presidency.Great documentary for anyone who hasn\u2019t seen it: \u20186 Days to Air\u2019Except they take a year or more between six episode seasons now. :/One of my favorite uses was in paragraph 68, stating, \u201cGovernor Desantis\u2019s memoir describes the attack on Disney with pride\u2026\u201d and then proceeds to quote it.Page 32, Section 90 of the brief.\n\nIt was in the charter for RCID.  One vote per acre of land owned in the District.  It quotes the law there.That's one thing Republicans never understood about capitalism: despite all the criticisms that can be directed toward capitalism, prejudice and bigotry aren't among them. A true capitalist doesn't give a crap if their customer is black, white, gay, straight, trans, etc. All the true capitalist cares about is that the customer is spending money on their product/service.100.\n\nGOP and free market are at odds and they don\u2019t know what to do other then try to use their last grasp at power to create their utopian \u201cJesus\u201d society.\n\nThis is exactly why separation of religion and state is essential to a free society.This.Absolutely.  And a nice trend is that the wealthier and more influential companies are becoming more and more queer friendly.  Looking at the companies that are most highly rated for lgbtq safety in the workplace, a lot (most?) of them are some of the biggest money makers out there.  So even when we can\u2019t vote right now with our ballots, we\u2019re voting with our wallets.  And we can\u2019t drop the ball now, we have to keep voting in *both* areas until we kick these fascists out.  I\u2019m proud of Disney for fighting for first amendment rights.Hopefully, by then, we have the means to fix a busted system that allows us to fight for ourselves rather than waiting for this absolutely golden r/leopardsatemyface momentI mean I don't consider their remakes as creative enterprises. There is only what is allowed to exist so that they can claim they are making something 'new' and only in the most milk toast, focus group-approved way possible.Totally! I used to work for a chip manufacturer and they loved to brag that they are the largest law firm in San Diego. Hey when your entire business is ip! You\u2019ve got a few hundred and more to spare.I would be ok with Nestl\u00e9 buying towns, would be much better than their current model of just taking the water for freeBack in 1967 there was nothing but swampy land where Disney is now. Walt Disney bought the first 8,380 acres in 1965 (from a state senator) and then bought from 47 landowners for a total 27,400 acres. Most of the landowners had nothing on their land because it was swampy. Many had never even been on the land as they inherited and never went to it.  Disney did keep it secret that it was Disney buying the land though. And it's important to consider that the land was swampy and fallow and undeveloped.  Thousands if acres of empty swampy land. Leaving environmental considerations aside (which I'm sure were hugely significant), what Disney built there and expanded on over following decades, is the only reason that surrounding properties and towns have grown and property values escalated in the immediate decades after its construction, and continues to this day.  Disney made central FL.  Would central FL have developed on its own? Probably, maybe, but at a far far slower pace.  Would Universal have built there if Disney hadn't caused the massive number of hotels built?\n\n Love it, or hate it, there is no denying that Disney World was THE driving force for making central Florida matter and it provides massive economic benefits for the state and for the surrounding communities.Boston (Mayor Menino) quickly [backtracked on his letter to Chick-Fil-A](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/bostons-mayor-backtracks-blocking-chick-fil-i-cant-do/325400/), recognizing that as long as the company didn\u2019t violate discrimination laws it could operate without interference. \n\nTo draw an equivalence between the DeSantis-Disney situation is ludicrous.And I'm old enough to remember arguing with people in my city that they shouldn't support it. Maybe you just got here.\n\nThis was the first one that came to mind. Another more recent example would be the calls to block Elon from buying Twitter because of the nonsense that he says. That one was a non-starter though.I'm going to guess there was a lot of counsel, both inside and outside. And we already know DeSantis's law school buddies are getting $1290 from Florida for his defense.This is all setting a terrifying precedent if he does get elected. I\u2019m imagining a lot of punitive nonsense against corporations and blue states.This is exactly it and the MSM is complicit. Who would have known who DeSantis was if he wasn't doing controversial shit? Being in a fight with Disney, no matter how stupid, keeps his name in the news and people more and more aware of him. Now he's a Republican household name.Amazing. Love how perfectly this portrays the party.Pretty sure Disney gutted that part of the board's control.  \n\nReedy Creek is actually unique in Florida that they can set their own MIL rate.And losing.  Badly.He's having a dick measuring contest with **the** mouse.Elliott PageHis best chance is to cooperate with the feds to somehow find the illegal shit at Mar-A-Lago to throw Trump in jail. And even then, Meatball Ron still managers to fuck himself by going against the Mouse....\"On January 21, 2010, the court issued a 5\u20134 decision in favor of Citizens United that struck down BCRA's restrictions on independent expenditures from corporate treasuries as violations of the **First Amendment.**\\[31\\]\"\n\nThe majority wrote, \"If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens\\_United\\_v.\\_FEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC)\n\nI'm no lawyer, but as I understand it Citizens United furthered the concept of 'commercial speech' as free speech. Basically the notion that corporations are 'associations of people' and thus have free speech protections.Binders full of lawyersYou're right about that.You said 'sins'. Sins are defined in the Torah. Christianity only adds two, and DeSantis is following neither of the two commandments imposed by Jesus.Oh yeah. This guy and his staff will suddenly all have the memory of a goldfish.The mouse probably already has themAnd then the services used for email and any other comms will just be like, \"Hey yo, they deleted things? Naww dawg, we got it.\"I do too. But Disney lawyers will fix it for them, don't worry.The emails can be found on Hillary's secret servers...Florida has some of the most wide ranging open government laws in the country, which is amended in its constitution. So it shouldn\u2019t surprise you that republicans, as corrupt as ever, have largely ignored them and are now trying to write laws around them legislatively\u2026 the amendment, however, is very clear, so like most things the GOP does in Florida, they are playing the game of getting what they want until the lose in court 10 years later.If they were capable of introspection or empathy you'd think they would at least understand the plight of trans-men, but they hate them too.You know I have some selfies with some trans folks - people have seen them on my phone when I show them a pic - I am always like she was the coolest chick ever - find out real quick where people stand. We are all naked under our clothes.Lol I\u2019m a libertarian.They have, but it's always crap that they know won't stick.  Between taking office and Sept of 2022, there were 14 different articles of impeachment filed against Biden.  Most of the time it's just MTG throwing shit at the wall though.That's what the whole Weaponization of Federal Government and House Oversight subcommittees were supposed to be doing (in part): coming up with a reason to impeach Biden.\n\nUnfortunately, the perfect combination of GQP incompetence and the fact that Biden is pretty above board with his personal and political life has made that impossible.Give them time. Right now they\u2019re too busy destroying the US credit rating. Once that mission is accomplished then they\u2019ll turn to the Bidens.Give them the senate, and they will.\n\nThis is why people have to vote.They don\u2019t have the votesI poked them a few times after jan 6th. I was literally told by someone that \"no one in this sub is denying it was an insurrection.\" Meanwhile, there were active threads where people were literally denying it. They say whatever they think will \"win\" in the immediate moment.Yes they don\u2019t like critical thinking or being called out on the maga fourms. Usually they just flag as spam or disinformation. LolThe far right justices\u2019 ideology is to back the side who  gifts them bestIt's not even a contest. DeSantis will get Alito and Of John (and Thomas, just being an asshole), but the three Dem appointees and three corporate tools will be against him.man-sweating-over-two-buttons.pngIIRC it wasn\u2019t until like 3 days in that they had their plot lmao great docAh approaching the Venture Bros model.I can kinda understand that. They've been doing it for a long time.Because they tell stories they want to tell.This is what astounds me about post-teaparty Republicans. They claim to support the free market and minimal government intervention. \n\nBut then a dude tries to literally annex real estate from a private corporation and he's a Republican Shoe-in for the GOP POTUS nomination. \n\nIt's the least free market thing you can do and arguably the most egregious government overreach in the history of the state.Bingo.  They don't.  They didn't care when our voting rights were and still under massive attack but we buy from the companies.  What the heck will they do when we're stripped of so much we won't be able to buy from them anymore and what, they'll go find another autocratic country to sell wares there like NK or mainland China?  It is nuts.Disney isn\u2019t fighting for first amendment rights _exactly_, but they are likely going to use that as the logic. They\u2019re fighting because the Florida state government is trying to take things from Disney that would reduce its profitability and ability to do business the way it believes (under the law) that it should be permitted to do business.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because it\u2019s a \u201cbiting the hand that feeds you\u201d issue all the way down. Disney is being bitten by the GOP leadership in the state, which they have historically contributed to financially, and the GOP leadership is being bitten by Disney because they\u2019re consistently doing things antithetical to a capitalist democracy (or republic, whatever) by trying to punish Disney for speaking out against laws clearly built around hate and intolerance.Just to let you know it\u2019s _milquetoast_He bought it to fight for \u201cfree speech\u201d. \n\nIt sho don\u2019t look like it right about now though, huh?Randos in your city telling you to boycott Chik-fil A are randos exercising their free speech. \n\nThe government telling you to boycott them because they say bigoted things is a first amendment violation though.The scary part is about a third of the country *wants that*.I do think though, and I may be wrong, that this all generally detracts from his chances of becoming popular nationally among the republicans. Practically everyone in Florida who votes red liked him, and for a while I genuinely thought he\u2019d easily surpass Trump during the run (which admittedly remains to be seen). But I think bringing attention to him among the centrists and left will only be beneficial in his downfall, especially given how much of an ass he\u2019s made of himself in this whole debacle. \n\nEven now right wing people in Florida are having second thoughts about him, at least from what I\u2019ve heard and seen. I think even the most brain dead among them realize that he does not care about Florida, and probably aren\u2019t as invested in his \u201cwar on woke\u201d as he thinks they are. Him doing \u201cbook tours\u201d, aka unofficial campaigning, outside of Florida only furthers this issue, since he is seen to be giving up his job as governor for his political aspirations of President. \n\nHe\u2019s also way way less charismatic as Trump is. As much as I despise the guy and everything he stands for, Trump is undeniably more comfortable and competent with TV and media appearances, and already has a giant brand and reputation/cult built around him. I genuinely believe that Ronny Pudding Fingers being in the public eye will be damaging to him. He can\u2019t control narrative, he doesn\u2019t come off as likable even in a twisted sense, and his only current form of self promotion is an, admittedly dangerous and damaging, crusade against the left and LGBTQ folks. \n\nAll this is to say I hope I\u2019m right. DeathSantis is for all of his failings as a person, much smarter and driven than Trump, who couldn\u2019t focus on a task if it was taped to him. I genuinely believe him being in power will be the end of American democracy more-so than Trump was, if only due to his incompetence.The vote this morning that triggered the lawsuit was to renege on the contract from the ousted board.And that would be **Mr.** Mouse to *you*!Good one. And I bet he would act the shit out of it too.As an in-house lawyer, I can tell you Disney has an army of top lawyers. DeSantis is fucked.\u201cExcuse me, Mr. the Mouse?  You seem to have dropped this attorney on your way to fight fascism. Shall I feed it and put it back with the others?\u201dThis guy! \u201cSuddenly\u201d\u2026 \n\nBut yes, I agreePerhaps, although like people dealing with Trump they might have learned to keep recordings and records. Insurance.Every Libertarian I've ever met was just a Republican with Liberal friends who would stop talking to them if they had the balls to stand by their political beliefsWell, that could just be the ape DNA in her.I thought it takes McCarthy 15 tries to get anything done though\u2026I heard Biden leaves the toilet seat up. IMPEACH.Dems didn't have the votes and they impeached the former dimwit twice. Hell, back in the day, they impeached Clinton for lying about a blowjob because he didn't want his wife to find out, and they knew they didn't have the votes then. Not having the votes hasn't stopped anyone before, why now?The mouse has a thick checkbook.Because the Tea Party was never about conservatism. It was about outrage because a black man was in the White House. They knew it was a bad thing to do so they kept that part quiet but the anger was still there. Then Trump came along and told them their bigotry and hatred are acceptable and that's why they love him so much.>a Republican Shoe-in for the GOP POTUS nomination. \n\nHuh? This is about DeSantis not Trump. You know, Trump, the presumptive nominee.Progressives (randos as well as people I know IRL) cheering our mayor for trying to prevent them from opening stores here.\u201cSmall government\u201d indeed, except when you disagree with us.ARMY being the keyword here\u2026 *Top* men.But just for good measure they hired an elite outside firm for this case as well.Love it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffcLol that\u2019s pretty funny but not accurate. I vote for democrats and republicans. There\u2019s people in both parties with libertarian ideals they just can\u2019t run as libertarian party because they\u2019re too small to get anything done. Really it\u2019s just an ideology but small minded people tend to judge based on labels, as you just haveAww, don't insult apes like that! They are intelligent, can solve problems, use tools, and show compassion.\n\nE- To be fair, they can also rip off your arms and beat you to death with them, but that's still more sane than Marge.Humans are like 2% off from apes right? MTG is at least 15%Ah, I see you follow the works of Majorly Treacherous Greene.Real talk though, I'd honestly be kind of surprised if he does, he's definitely kind of that old school gentlemanly type who was probably taught not to do that.They did have the votes to impeach.And fantastic vacation packages.The tea party was started to recapture republicans that were turned off by Bush. \n\nIt gave them an excuse to keep voting republican while claiming they didn't. It was playing on their fears during the financial crisis. The tea party was \"for fiscal responsibility!\" Not that war we were just lied into or the cratering of our economy.\n\nYou are right the outrage over a black man in the white house was a part of it as well but not the driving factor. The Republican party has never had a problem supporting racists my entire life as far back as Nixon at least  \n\nBush is mostly forgotten now because Trump took it to a whole other level but...\n\nAt the end of W's second term you were hard pressed to find someone who admitted voting for him. He was that bad, and ended his disastrous presidency with the banking collapse.\n\nThe Republican party was looking done and presto we have a totally not the Republicans Tea party. Oddly they vote lock step with Republicans.\n\nBy trying to save the party by creating the tea party it seems they have only made it worse as the monster they created (to totally not be the republican party you are embarrassed by) has all but taken over.\n\nIt got them through the Obama years without sustaining the bloodbath that was going to happen without them.\n\nI would not be surprised at all to see a maga splinter in this next election with maga candidates pushed where it is strategic while the republican establishment try to run away from them.\n\nSorry for the wall of text just had to spew all that cause the whole tea party thing just triggered all the memories of the Bush years. \n\nFucking republicans two failed presidencies in a row costing us decades of progress and they are salivating to do it again. These people never learn.This is typical. No mega corporation would represent themselves in court. The law firm is more of an alliance than doing all the work. It\u2019s like Hulk Hogan and the Rock forming an alliance against a meatball.\u2026and they have nicer feet than Margie.I used to want a chimp buddy until that one ate that lady's face offFree annual passes for life for all supreme court justices.Correct. As outside counsel myself, I appreciate this kind of firepower, and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve believed from day 1 that Disney will come out on top. You\u2019ve got very capable in house folks who have helped dot every i and cross every t leading up to this moment. Combined with hand picked national trial lawyers to handle the litigation. DeSantis can hire good attorneys but he\u2019s unlikely to find anyone better, and they\u2019ll be fighting an uphill battle for a client who basically admitted to everything in his published memoir.I've seen cattle with nicer feet.Sorry to read you dream of BJ and the Bear has come to an end. https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0078564/",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*Its a federal lawsuit too. So his cronies in the Florida judiciary can't do anything about it.Kind of an open and shut case here. \n\nDesantis has been only targeting Disney. No one elseThey sued minutes after the board voted to nullify the previous agreement.  \nEdit: Reference on that from the NY Times:  \n>On Wednesday, a board appointed by Mr. DeSantis to oversee government services at Disney World voted to nullify two agreements that gave Disney vast control over expansion at the 25,000-acre resort complex. Within minutes, Disney sued Mr. DeSantis, the five-member board and other state officials in federal court, claiming \u201ca targeted campaign of government retaliation.\u201dThe actual lawsuit: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23789605-disney-v-desantis-complaint\n\nInvocations of the Contracts Clause, 1st amendment, 14th amendment, and 5th amendment violations. And every one of them is so blatant.\n\nThe 1A claims should be a slam dunk. Disney cites the multiple times DeSantis explicitly commented on actions being used as punishment. They even cited a passage from his book where he specifically calls out Disney as an example of having to use the power of the government to push back on \"woke corporations\".Disney played this smart. Really smart. \n\nThey have an open and shut case on first amendment grounds. They were utterly silent this entire time. They offered to meet with the governor to talk it out, and they were unjustly targeted because of a corporate policy of protecting their employees. \n\nFlorida is going to be owned by Disney even more after this is done.2022: the right screams, \u201cfoul,\u201d when a private social media company limits speech on their platform (not protected by the 1st - which only shields you from government persecution). \n\n2023: the right celebrates DeSantis punishing Disney for speaking freely against his government\u2019s anti-LGBTQ+ actions (a right explicitly protected by the 1st).Is it legal to gamble on the outcome of a trial? Because I think I'd like to...This case is gonna be a bloodbath. DeSantis has been extremely open about how this is retaliation for Disney speaking against him. Throw in Disney paying for some of the country\u2019s best lawyers, and this case could ruin DeSantis\u2019 political future in a heartbeat.Every business and trade group in the country is on Disney's side with this. We're talking about RIDONKULOUS amounts of money that goes to lobbyists and lawyers, and all of it will be turned against DeSantis. The business community cannot allow this precedent to stand, for government to be able to invalidate lawful contracts. PhRMA, manufacturers, big tech, unions, big oil, energy, private prisons, real estate agents, auto dealers, farmers... Literally every special interest group in the country will be with Disney on this.\n\nDeSantis' political future is dead as of right now.There no chance that DeSantis didn\u2019t send at least one email or text message that he\u2019ll regret.  Disney will also likely use other things they find regarding sending immigrants on planes to the north and book banning to build their case.You know things are jacked up when we're rooting for the giant mega-corp.How can Republicans claim to be pro free speech or pro business when they target companies for using free speech?Disney's senior lawyer in the complaint is Daniel M. Petrocelli, who won $8.5 million in damages for the family of one of O. J. Simpson's victims (civil lawsuit), and defeated the Justice Department when they opposed the AT&T and Time Warner merger.\n\nEdit : another of the lawyers (they are 3) is Jonathan D. Hacker, and on his firm website it says he argued 6 cases in the US Supreme Court.\n\nDisney ain't playing!\"I heard you struck DeSantis.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me why?\"\n\n\"He fucked with the Mouse.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"Only way to make this more entertaining is to have the lawyers show up in full drag.And now Florida residents will have to eat the coat of his legal fees.Note that Disney filed suit in federal court, where DeSantis and the Florida legislature have no influence.  This isn't going to end well for him and I'm here with my popcorn... \ud83d\ude01I love it. Disney just said fuck it to calling DeSantis bluff. By logging this suit they are telling every donor DeSantis screwed up big time. DeSantis will have only two ways to respond: 1 eat crow and walk back everything which will make him look weak; or 2 go all in and destroy whatever credibility he has left with the big donors. \n\nHaving seen how DeSantis reacted already I fully expect him to go all in on his own destruction. His response will make him radioactive to any company donor or any big individual donor who isn\u2019t bonkers.\n\nEdit: Ha and there here we go. In the time between the OP post, my reply and this edit the number of media outlets reporting the Disney suit has grown exponentially. DeSantis\u2019s ego won\u2019t let him let this go quietly. Expect something dumb before the end of the week only magnifying his inadequacies and becoming radioactive.[deleted]Imagine being so shitty that you are personally sued by the happiest place on earth.IANAL, but with DeSantis bragging in speeches that he would use his office to attack Disney, the case seems pretty clear (?).\u201cDisney sues Florida Man\u2026\u201dI'm sure Desantis's team of lawyers are up to the task. Why I bet they're prepping their defense even as we speak! They watched Matlock at a bar last night, [the sound wasn't on but they think they got the jist of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfAAjC3wVY)Them low salary civil service attorneys bout to get rolled up by disney money.Ronnie's been playing cat and mouse with Disney. Disney is just . . . not playing any fucking games. Famous quote: don't get between a man and his dinner. \n\nDisney is going to get their dinner, even if they have to chew through Ronnie to get there.Slam dunk for Disney.I haven't gone to r/conservative to check out what they're saying yet, but I'm betting there will be tons of comments saying \"dIsCoVeRy!!!\"Its crazy that Desantis and the GOP are using taxpayer resources to wage a punitive war against a private company, the largest employer in Florida, entirely because they were critical of one of his positions.\n\nHis main campaign strategy is to run as \"the smart Trump\" or \"Trump without the baggage\" ... but this is entirely the same kind of performative fragile childishness that I just can't comprehend being appealing to voters. What is wrong with Florida?\"We are unaware of any legal right that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in the state,\u201d DeSantis\u2019 communications director Taryn Fenske said in a statement to CNBC.\"\n\nThey're going to have a hard time explaining the other 1,844 special districts in Florida.Ron has entered the \"find out\" section of the \"Fuck around, find out\" process.I mean, that\u2019s exactly what DeSantis is doing. And he\u2019s not going to be able to claim executive privilege, so\u2026\n\nPopcorn, anyone?and.. here... we... go.Rooting for a corporation to ruin a politician feels very cyberpunk, but fuck it. Dick him to death, Disney.I was reading through the actual PDF of the suit itself.   As I was getting into it, I realized there weren't any grammar, spelling, punctuation, or other careless mistakes.    I'd gotten used to seeing all of those FREQUENTLY in all the crap suits filed by Trump and his other MAGA stooges.\n\nNice to see what smart professional lawyers can do ... competency matters!This is about as obvious a decision as you could imagine. DeSantis literally said that the decision to remove Disney's Special District was because of their stance on Trans issues. He said it multiple times. There's no possible spin. \n\nThe Florida Government infringed free speech rights by retaliating against an entity's protected speech. \n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Supreme Kangaroo Court can handle this layup of a case. However, how ironic would it be for them to rule that corporations aren't people and inadvertantly overturn Citizen's United.What an absolutely hilarious week it's been..\n\n\n787 million dollar settlement at Fox, Carlson on his ass, Meatball Ron getting the cold hard dick of Disney's legal team shoved up his puppet hole, Trump's civil rape suit is off to the races along with his many other legal troubles\n\nEdit: also Crowder's wife dumped him lol\n\nBeautiful.>\u201cDisney picked the fight with this board,\u201d Garcia said. He also said that taxes will have to go up to pay for lawyers hired by the board to evaluate Disney\u2019s \u201celeventh-hour agreements.\u201d\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to raise taxes to pay for that,\u201d he said.\n\nThat's definitely a good look. \"We're gonna have to raise taxes to pay for our self-inflicted legal fight\"Go get him, Disney!https://i.imgur.com/Gcdds9u.jpg\n\nThese people are just \u2026. gone.Do republicans ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING FOR PEOPLE!? What a fucking waste of of taxpayer money, resources, time, etc. Jfc I can\u2019t stand this guy.This would seem to be a stronger lawsuit than the Dominion lawsuit. We don\u2019t just have DeSantis\u2019s verbal attacks and defamation against Disney, but also Government action intended, as admitted by DeSantis, to \u201cpunish\u201d the company.I mean, Mr. Iger graciously offered to meet with Ron to see if they could work things out.   To no one's surprise Ron keeps charging ahead.  He doesn't seem to have any mental dexterity, or touch, or the ability to look ahead a bit and strategize how to achieve his goals.  If he was actually president, god in heaven please forbid, he probably would have nuked Disney World already.This makes me happy.\n\nDisney has the cash to summon lawyers the likes of which you need a personal referral from Satan *and* Cthulhu to be given an appointment.\n\nI don't feel even a little bit bad about all the money I've given them over the years if it means this proto fascist dictator gets *destroyed.*\n\n*Give salute to Disney* go get em tiger.[deleted]What did Ron think was gonna happen\u2026.he may as well have been summoning CthulhuDisney has 1000% been waiting for this moment. And they are pretty likely to win this.Ronny is now in the \u2018find out\u2019 phase of \u2018fuck around and find out\u2019. \n\nIt\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s not risking his entire political career on this next presidency run by turning Florida into a shithole to score cheap political points that seem to be pissing everyone off equally\u2026 oh wait[never fuck with the mouse](https://media.tenor.com/Uwb_I0i8nuIAAAAC/mickey-mouse-south-park.gif)Disney's complaint (PDF):\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article274740711.ece/BINARY/file-stamped-disney-complaint1.pdfIn China they silence business leaders who don\u2019t follow the party line.   This is America.  It\u2019s amazing how anti-job and anti-business the GOP has become.   Disney is Florida\u2019s largest employer.  How is it in the state\u2019s interest to try to destroy them?   Disney is defending our rights against a two bit wanna be dictator.Using citizen's united ruling against Republicans has to be the biggest case of /leopards ate my face.What a dumb ass. What a waste of tax payer money.DeSantis is DOA for the 2024 presidential race and I could not be happier.  Guy lost the race before he ever officially announced. \ud83e\udd23DeSantis: We\u2019ll nullify your rights.\n\nDisney Lawyers: *SEND*.Prepare to be royally fucked, HARD, DeSantis.*Find out mode activates*\n\nI do believe DeFascist wants this though. He needs to look like he's a fighter, especially now that the lead GOP candidate is making him look like a fool.\n\nOof, lots of responses, most with the same gist. \n\nI do agree this is the wrong fight to pick, but either he is not aware or he wasn't in the beginning and is now afraid to look weak.Picking a fight with one of the most powerful corporations who has endless resources? That's a bold strategy cotton, let's see if it pays off for him.I'm sure conservatives in Flordia are going to be PISSED at Florida's state government trying to dictate how a private business is run, as well as using Flordia state tax dollars to fight this legal suit. \n\nJust kidding, we all know conservatives are incapable of putting together a coherent thought. And they are the ones bringing this in themselves.Should be easy to prove in court when the legislation passed specifically punishes Disney alone. Add that to all the stuff that has been said by DeSantis publicly about getting back at Disney, and the case is a slam dunk.This moron went from thinking he would be the next president, to losing a continued battle against a cartoon mouse.This is the guy some people think should run the country?This was a trap as anticipated by several independent lawyers all along. The latest step by Desantis just build a stronger case for Disney.Desantis is in the \u201cfind out\u201d phase of fucking around.We\u2019ll be rooting for Disney here. Huge corporation or not, he\u2019s fighting an authoritarian hateful govt that\u2019s using the power of the state to attack a company because said company failed to politically align with them. This is some Putin\u2019s Russia or Maduro\u2019s Venezuela level sh*tGonna be hard to prove in court. Disney is going to have to bring newspapers or video of DeSantis talking.Can you imagine the existential dread having a corporation the size of Disney suing YOU personally? DeSantis really stomped on the rake with this whole thing.Never thought I'd be on Disney's side, but in this case, I am behind them 100%.\n\nBut I'm a hypocrite, because I think corporations are NOT people, and should NOT have the same rights as people, and I believe 100% in that.\n\nSo I guess I'm really 0% in all this.\n\nHOWEVER, I hate DeShitlicker, so I'm back up to 100% again, whew!Bahahaha! Get hosed DeSantisTo think that this entire shit show started because of intolerance towards gay people.  Smh.  Shameful, ugly politics.Based on the fact that DeSantis has repeatedly and openly bragged about the very thing Disney is accusing him of and the fact that the leadership at Disney can afford the best lawyers that money can buy and actually will listen to them, I don't see this going well for DeSantis or the Florida Taxpayers whose money is on the line here.Is there a non-zero percent chance that Florida goes bankrupt and is absorbed by Disney making Disney a State?Imagine wasting this much public money because you don't like gay people.We're gonna have to change DeSantis' name to Princess Jasmine because Disney is about to show him a whole new world.Anyone who has been viewing this as some WWE showdown of Meatball Ron vs Da Mouse needs to get real serious real quick about this. DeSantis could be the Republican candidate for President and right now he is banning speech about gender and sexuality in schools (potentially up to grade 12 with what is being proposed) and is now retaliating against an organization for being critical of the government.\n\nI don't know how much more blatantly fascist he can get. The dude is vying for the cultural genocide of gay or trans people and will expend every effort to squash anyone who dares oppose him. And get *applauded* for it.\n\nThis is very very very bad.Squeal like a mouse, Ron!\u201cWill of the Florida voters\u201d\u2026this is your fight Dumbsantis, not ours.Desantis really thought that provoking the state\u2019s largest employer and tourism attractor was a good idea, I hope Disney buries him.Discovery is going to be interesting. Florida tax payers are going to be paying for this. Oh well, this is what they voted for.Alleges? Didn\u2019t Ronnie straight up admit this is what he\u2019s doing?Finish him Disney.  Finish him!I was a bit surprised Disney didn't do this earlier.  But Disney played this beautifully, they waited and let Baby RonRon speak publicly and continue to build Disney's case for them before pulling the trigger.  Florida is f'd.I know very few rules in life, one of them is not fucking around so much to the point where Disney sues me.Floridians should be able to sue DeSantis personally for wasting our tax dollars with this bullshit.Disney filing a lawsuit is no laughing matter, DeSantis should be very worried. They keep a very powerful and well paid legal team on staff. They're gonna take that fuckin' meatball to the cleaners.So let me get this straight. The current lead candidate for the RNC is up on criminal charges with more imminent. And the lead contender is getting sued by Disney.\n\nThat's a real winning party you got there!Mickey Mouse is gonna kick his ass.Fuck. I hate Disney but right now. I\u2019m cheering for my mouse overlordI don't live in the US but God help them if his guy ever becomes President. He would be worse than Trump. And that's no small feat.I was at Magic Kingdom just yesterday, and I saw multiple gay and lesbian people (including one young lesbian couple openly holding hands) as well as people of every racial and cultural background, either attending or working for Disney.\n\nTheir content increasingly reflects the diversity of their audience. You have Disney princesses that are black and asian. And they're not all princesses-in-waiting; they're warriors too.\n\nThis is what the Right hates about Disney. It's not their business practices, of which there's a lot to criticize. It's their commit to diversity. \n\nI'm not even a Disney fan, but people are willing to pay thousands of dollars to attend a cheesy theme park in the swamps of central Florida. Orlando as we know it would not exist if not for Disney.They aren\u2019t even trying to hide that they are actively pursuing legislation to hurt Disney just for spite. Because they dared say that the fascist state of Desantistan was wrong in its treatment of lgbt people.If only there were some sort of public statements they could use to prove intent. /sLove that Disney let him campaign on this for a bit so they could gather evidence and sound bites of him making it clear he\u2019s going against a private business for free speech.How do Republicans defend this? Big government intervention into a private business, because they exercise their free speech to support gay rights.What\u2019s really wild isn\u2019t so much that DeSantis did what he did, but that he was so transparent about his reasons for doing so.\n\nUsually you\u2019d expect at least a surface level of plausible deniability but no, it was straight \u201cDisney doesn\u2019t hate gay people enough so I\u2019m punishing them for that reason and that reason alone\u201d.So the number two Republican candidate for President is being sued by Disney. This comes a few weeks after the number one candidate was indicted on charges regarding funds he used as hush money for a porn star. \n\nThese are the two candidates the Republicans are going to push for 2024. One is being sued by fucking Mickey Mouse and the other had sex with a porn star. The situation is so unbelievable.\"\u201cWe are unaware of any legal right that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in the state,\u201d DeSantis\u2019 communications director, Taryn Fenske, said in a statement to CNBC.\"\n\nActually, the DeSantis administration is fully, completely and totally aware of it, and had no issue with the money Disney gave to government in the form of taxes:\n\n\"Disney\u2019s lawyers noted that until a year ago, DeSantis and his allies had no issue with the self-governing structure, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District.\n\nThat entity, created in 1967, gave Disney regulatory control over public services and other functions in the 25,000-acre area encompassing its Florida parks and resorts. Disney paid millions of dollars annually in taxes levied through Reedy Creek to fund those services, on top of its local tax obligations.\n\nDeSantis signed legislation to dissolve that special designation just weeks after Disney denounced the classroom bill.\"\n\nThis puts every corporation on notice that, unless they obey DeSantis' fascist orders, they'll be punished.  Let's see how many corporations become obedient, and how many bristle at this excessive \"regulation\".Weaponization of government.Whoa whoa whoa, I thought conservatives were pro business and pro first amendment???????????Good. Run his goofy ass out of never never landHow fast will Republicans give themselves whiplash by arguing that Citizens United needs to be overturned?This man really thinks he can win this, huh? He really thinks this will end in any way but miserable failure and humiliation? Is he trying to make himself the victim so he can rally a base around revenge for his own failures like Trump did? News flash, Ronnie: ***_NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOU._***Desantis is such a fucking idiot. What a waste of tax dollars he's bitten off with all this anti Disney legal horseshitWell remember to link this to the republicans. \n\nDesantis has tantrum and uses your money to do it. He is raising taxes twice now because disney used their freedom of speech.\n\nSounds anti buisness, pro tax, anti constitution! Plus he is threatening the largest employer in florida! Lets not even mention that they have one of the worst teacher shortages in the country directly becUse of his policies.\n\nI mean he is trying to allow civilians to sit in public schools. Who knows who they could be. Transgender? Liberals? Non Christians?? \n\nNo wonder his numbers have been plummeting. \n\nEven more trump hates desantis.\n\nAlso red states having massively higher death by gun rates.Omg this just gets better and better. I love that Florida tax payers now have to pay legal fees to someone whose trying to *take away* tourism $$$ and jobs. Lol, what a state to live in.I did not have \u201cCheering for a corporation to take down one person\u201d on my bingo cardRon's POTUS campaign is very expensive for the Florida tax payer.Well Disney\u2019s got the best lawyers in the business. So Desantis is fuckedHad no idea I would be rooting for a mega corporation, but this timeline is all fucked up. Don\u2019t fuck with the mouseThis has been a great week of News.This is particularly rough for DeSantis given what we have recently found out about the Supreme Court. Disney has unlimited resources to appeal this all the way up to a group of judges that are bought and paid for by corporate money.This is going to be taught in Poli-Sci classes for decades on how not to start a presidential campaign.Nikki Haley twits at Disney: \u2018hey, bring yourself and your 70,000 jobs to my home state of South Carolina!\u2019 Yeah, good ol\u2019 South Carolina, where there\u2019s a proposal in the legislature to punish women who have had an abortion with *the death penalty.* Execution for abortion.\n\nWhen are the forced-birthers gonna drop the act- that this has anything to do with \u2018respect for life?\u2019 They don\u2019t care about the lives of women, except as their bodies are vessels for the next generation of wage slaves. That defect in your body that prevents you from carrying a pregnancy to term renders you worthless to us, so no one cares if you die.\"Woke leftist Disney is trying to cancel me!\"\n\n- Something that idiot will undoubtedly sayWhat a proper use of tax payer money. Good job De-shitheadImagine taking on Disney with your team of crackpot lawyers.I love this for him.So are people buying up Disney merch and burning it out of protest in large droves? No? I\u2019m going to guess that a lot of conservatives make Disney more a part of their personalities than gender politics. \n\nThe Mouse is very well aware of this and is certain they will come out on top. And they are 100% correct.\n\nSource: took a recent Disney Cruise with LOTS of Southern conservative folks. They ain\u2019t about to boycott that shit. They may gripe about particular films, but that\u2019s as far as it\u2019ll go.Go Mickey, go Mickey!!!Open and shut first ammendment violation. Disney lawyers are gonna leave DeSantis with a prolapsed anus.The title should read Florida Man Keeps Loosing To Giant MouseThe funny thing is, if Desatan is doing this to help his prospects to become president, he might as well forget it. Trump will be the Republican nominee no matter what.And Ron Desantis will hire his buddies to represent him and bleed the state of Florida dry on the way to losing this suit.  \n\nFlorida\u2026vote different for Christ\u2019s sake.  You\u2019re just voting to fuck yourselves.The finding out phase has begunThis is the legal equivalent of parking the independence day city destroyer over whatever the florida equivalent of the capitol building is...You come at the mouse, you best not missDisney to urge the court to serve meatballs at the lunch breakThis is the endgameI don\u2019t know of anyone who can fuck with Disney. They will always outsmart you, outlawyer you, outspend you. They will have a squad of top tier lawyers that will fuck you legally without lube or dinner. \n\nGod fucking damn, DeSantis chose a bad company to pick a fight witjAh it seems DeSantis has entered his *\u201dFind out\u201d* stageThe biggest knife is that Disney has baited DeSantis into blatant 1A violations while not overtly retaliating or making any statements. If Ron had kept his name out of things, Disney and the RCDD could have played games for a long time, but the goal was punishing Disney for attention and now every corp donor knows Ron will go dictator on them if they step out of line. Corporate donors aren't going to look favorably on a candidate willing to get in the way of their business for culture war brownie points. They want candidates who will prioritize their favors and play culture war for the base in ways that don't matter.I imagine Walgreens is watching this with great interest. I wouldn't be surprised if they submitted an amicus brief in favor of Disney here.Do you know how evil you have to be for Disney to be the \u201cgood guy\u201d in a lawsuit?> In a response, DeSantis\u2019 office suggested the fight hinged on Disney\u2019s special tax and governance privileges, not political retaliation.  \n\nAren't they literally on record from a year ago saying they're doing it because Disney spoke out?It's like DeSantis completely forgot that Republicans are supposed to be pro-business and pro-growth. What's good for Disney is good for the state that he is supposedly in charge of. DeSantis is a buffoon.Not my area of law, but it seems to be the dozens of speeches DeSantis and his staff and underlings have given SPECIFICALLY STATING THEY ARE TARGETING DISNEY INDIVIDUALLY DUE TO IT BEING \"WOKE\" are pretty strong evidence of violations of the 1st amendment. Possibly bill of attainder issues as well? Less sure about that.Who you got in this one: extremely well paid, highly skilled lawyers for Disney, or a combination of underpaid public employees and law firms dumb enough to take on Disney\u2019s lawyers?I thought the demise of Carlson and DeSantis would never happen. They are both happening in the same week.What do republicans even believe in anymore? They\u2019ve gotten so tangled up in their culture war bullshit that a prominent Republican governor is targeting a private company basically to make a political stand against \u201cwokeness.\u201d Small government? Freedom for the private sector? Not anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating how easy it is for Republican politicians to manipulate their own constituents by twisting language and inventing words. No progressive uses the term \u201cwoke,\u201d but conservatives think we base our lives around the concept.DeSantis is a fool, this is just red meat to Disney's legal team.Who would've thought I'd be rooting for fucking Disney...Dudes gonna lose in court and owe them a ton of compensation. Don\u2019t fuck with Disney. They wouldn\u2019t sue if they didn\u2019t have a case. What an idiot he is.Imagine getting gaped by a mouseThe GOP decried government over reach and yet they are legislating what can be said, read and thought. Huh, thought they were all against that.We've entered the fuck around and find out phase of going to battle with the house of mouse.Ronnie about to learn corporations are people too.I don't see any way That Ron can win this case. His own written words support Disney's caseMega Corporation v. Fascist Florida. Guess there is a world where I can find myself rooting for one of the mega corporations if they're fighting filthy fascist that is.DUH. Desantis treats political theatre / outrage politics as the entire POINT of his governorship, without actually doing a decent job of governing. He's a comic book villain.I didn't think I'd be rooting for the mouse but here we are. Disney is way too big and controls too much of the industry, but fuck DeSantis.Ron just kissed his last chance of running for president good by. Disney will win, then turn around and ask for sanctions, but financial damages, like legal costs. Maybe even try to make Ron personally responsible, if they can establish that he acted outside of the legal authority of his office (He did.) And they will get it, for no one messes with Disney and gets away with it.\ud83d\ude02 Sue him out of all the lobbyist moneyDeSantis has basically explicitly state that as his goal publicly.He fell for victim to one of the classic blunders! The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia, but only slightly less well-known is this: Never start a legal battle with Disney's lawyers.DeSantis in the process of killing Florida\u2019s golden goose in the name of government overreach.Don\u2019t fuck with Disney you stupid wanna-be hitler.I know Disney is mega-corp, but could there be a more inocent symbol kicking a fascist's ass?\n\nGo Mickey!COMING SUMMER 2023: *How the Mouse Got the Meatball*DeSackoshit is going to go down in history as a such a tyrant and fail at his attempts to control Disney.But what about woke?!? Won't someone please think of wokeness?!\n\nIs like .. Anything I don't like \"woke.\" I effing hate broccoli... So broccoli is woke??\n\nThe hypocrisy and Idiocracy is maddeningWhen the mouse tells you to bounce, you should prolly bounceRon DeSantis need to be put in his placeDeSantis is gonna get steamrolled.Don\u2019t mess with the Mouse\u2026I am excited to see all the small-government republicans standing up against political retribution and supporting the private business. \n\n\u2026. Any minute now.This is pretty clear cut. I don\u2019t think even the Supreme Court will see it any other way. Rhonda is a dictator wanna be. If you own a business you should vote against him.I have never seen someone sabotage his own campaign that badly and that fast as DeSantis\u2026The Republican party is crumbling. In the next election I thought they would perform terribly since Trump and DeSantis supporters are pretty much against each other and would rather not vote if their candidate isn't picked. But now there might be neither Trump nor DeSantis. The way everything is happening lately is pure divine justice, music to the ears.Hey Disney, maybe next time don\u2019t give $200k in political contributions to a goddamn fascist?Yup.  This will be a protracted battle, but the result is not in doubt.  Clear abuse of governmental power.  Where are all those \"small gubb'ment\" mouth breathers now?I literally cannnnot wait for the south park mickey episodeDisney didn't just give Ronda Sandtits enough rope to hang himself, they gave him enough to make a custom-fitted macrame sex swing.   Within which he will be *fucked*, in case my meaning wasn't clear.I hope Disney uses their dragon horde of treasure to get DeSantis's dirty laundry out for the country to see.\n\nJust like Fox, I'm pretty sure the DeSantis camp will quickly crumble when discovery starts putting emails and text messages for the world to seeWe've reached the point where the Republicans in charge are the morons that they used to try to win over for votes.  Basically, they are a party of buffoons that are ending themselves out of pure ignorance.  Too bad they can't accelerate things toward their eventual demise.Disney has enough powerful lawyers that they could figure out a way to legally execute DeSantis in front of Disney castle.Don\u2019t. Fuck. With. The. Mouse.Disney vs Nazis eh? Well I\u2019m rooting for Disney.>\u201cDisney picked the fight with this board,\u201d Garcia said. He also said that taxes will have to go up to pay for lawyers hired by the board to evaluate Disney\u2019s \u201celeventh-hour agreements.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to raise taxes to pay for that,\u201d he said.\n\nYou could just not fight it to win political points and stop being absolute dinks.You know you done fucked up bad when /r/conservative and /r/politics BOTH agree that you're in the wrongWell he\u2019s losing this battle.\n\nDisneys lawyers are the one group of lawyers I most definitely would not want to fuck with.DeSantis is has to be doing this stunt just to look good to the knuckle dragging voters in his party. Makes no sense. The guy is a bully and a dummy with zero personality. What a dope!DeSantis' lawyers have to be real here.  Disney not only has a solid case against, BUT they also have the resources and experience to run his whole campaign into the ground.  Even if this doesn't go to court while he runs for President, they will surely do everything to suck up his financial resources, which aren't plentiful at the moment as many of his donors have already seen the coming storm.  \n\nDeSantis is a bad investment already, but now with the collosal might of Disney on his back, when they sink his teeth into him, they won't let go until they're satisfied.Never thought I\u2019d be in the corner of a company formed by a known anti-Semite fighting against a homophobic bigot. World works in some crazy ways.As a Florida resident, this makes me thrilled, I loathe DeSantis and the GOP as a whole but, don\u2019t elected officials have a sort of qualified immunity from being sued when acting in their official capacity?And ... FL taxpayers will be footing the bill for this lawsuit ... thank you Governor Desantis! Thank you Republican Party!Yeah, everything about DeSantis actions just scream explicit retaliation amd targeted action simply because Disney went against him on something.  He's like Palpatine with the whole \"I will MAKE IT legal\" line.  It's insane, but I'm very much rooting for Disney here.Good fuck DeSantis and everything he stands against.Disneyland is doing a gay pride week, Disney World should hold one just to give the finger to Ron and Co.\n\nTo think this all went down JUST because Disney supported gay rights openly.If I have learned anything over the past 20 years, it\u2019s don\u2019t fuck around with Bob Iger. The guy is a strategic and business execution genius. DeSantis\u2019 fragile ego kept him from recognizing he has been outsmarted since day 1 of this battle.Legitimate lawsuit there.  I bet they win.  Desantis certainly went after them for personal and political reasons rather than governingIm rooting disneyThe mouse never forgets, the mouse never forgives...Absolutely ruin his stupid brand and idiotic red meat nonsense politics, Disney will be there the next one hundred years how many more years can an idiot politician like De Santis last much longer, he\u2019s a passing cloud Disney represents sunshine and energy, you figure who will last longer.From what I've seen. Couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke.This will stay in court until his term ends. And by then, Disney will have already picked the next Gov lolRepublicans who worship big businesses and give corporations tax cuts are about to find out what happens when their culture wars target the very demons they created. Tides of money drowning them in opposition.Thank god, this could hurt him a lot even beyond 2024 if it goes bad enough for him. Which, by any reasonable metric it should. But I don't know if I have much faith in this system to let this get beyond some sort of quiet \"leave us alone and we'll drop it\" kind of settlementNot only do they file the suit on constitutional violation grounds but they didn\u2019t retaliate the whole time or threaten any of DeSantis\u2019 people or power. It\u2019s basically a story of a guy getting bullied the entire time and then taking diplomatic action against it. Plus, it\u2019s Disney. Their lawyers have lawyers who probably have lawyers too.Disney's cult is a lot bigger than Ron DeSantis' cult. He's pretty fucked.Ron Desantis is such a scumbag that he even makes Disney look good.Disney is like a third of Florida\u2019s economyFuck around entered.\n\n\nFind Out loading...I never thought I would see the day where I was on the side of the mouse in a law suit. They are the perfect example of evil litigating corporation.\n\nThey are exactly the people you don\u2019t want to pick a fight withHave fun dying on this hill, DeDipshit.Get fucked, DeSantis.Disney is going to fuck DeSantis raw.I assume the Florida taxpayers will foot the attorney's fees and such for both sides when Disney wins. It would be really nice for all Americans if these wanna be fascists were personally liable for the damages is cases of such blatant overreach.Lol. Get fucked, idiot.What a chump. What politician doesn't know that corporations are more powerful than government?This is a guaranteed win in court.Is DeSantis using the same lawyers as Trump? I mean the legal advise he must be getting is bad.  \n\n\nOh wait, that assumes he even checks with Lawyers. Moron.They messed with the MouseCouldn't have happened to a better guy. I wonder if there's any evidence they can possibly point to.Get him, Disney!This is what free market looks likeAre there going to be any Republican nominees without legal issues?\n\nAsking for a friend....He fucked around with Mickey Mouse, now he\u2019s \u2018bout to get Dolan DuckedI can't wait for that Meatball to reap what he sowed.Desantis abused his position, mis represented his consituants and will transfer the cost \" to the florida taxpayers\" .I\u2019m not sure but I think Disney might have more money than Ron Desantis.Never thought I'd cheer for a company over a government but here we are. \n\n*Insert LotR meme Legolas/Gimli*Good. Ron Desantis is a total nut case.We are going to hear DeSantis say, \"woke\" so many goddamn times it will make your head spin.Disney loading up the infinity stones and getting ready to snap at the Florida GOP \ud83e\udd23I'm impressed with Iger's move.  Iger is no one to screw with.\n\ni think Disney should make peace with Johnny Depp and have him come to Disneyworld for a concert.  That would blow Desantis out of the water.  But no one in Florida would hate Disney after that, if they ever did.\n\nI'm serious.  Bring in Johnny Depp.  And maybe revive Captain Jack Sparrow?This is how people like Trump and DeSantis can be stopped or at least slowed down in the future before they become elected officials - you sue them into oblivion before they can even get started, not after they've pulled a truly dangerous con and caused worlds of damage.The only way I\u2019m not rooting for Disney is if the Supreme Court rules that corporations don\u2019t have constitutional rights. If DeSantis wins this, could we feasibly have grounds to overturn Citizens United?What's the punishment for violeting the 1st amendment as a governor?\n\nI'm guess slap on the wrist and the ability to claim you're the victim as a key part of your next election campaign?Everybody gangsta till The Mouse shows upTLDR; Shouldn\u2019t have messed with the Mouse, especially one that brings in millions of dollars to that State from tourism.It\u2019s nice to see Disney fighting fascism.Go Disney. Destroy the rat.[removed]The fact that we constantly have to rely on corporations to do battle against this shit for us because the government has basically been neutered (in no small part by these same corporations) and can't or won't do it is...beyond disappointing. It's the same reason there was so much disappointment that dominion settled instead of dragging fox's ass across broken glass in trialOh this is gonna be fun to watchI\u2019m just trying to figure out if this is the second shoe I hear dropping??? I wonder if DeSantis realizes that his incompetent and churlish handling of his beef with Disney has exposed his childish character.I say we call in Gym Jordan to investigate.Will this be on pay-per-view? I don\u2019t like corporations but I hope Mickey banishes DeSatan back to the netherworlds.The discovery phase is going to be the most magical place on earth.can't wait for him to try to run his campaign saying he's \"pro-business\"Well that will be easy to prove in court.The discovery process on this is gonna be hilarious.TL;DR?\n\n>\tDisney responded by suing DeSantis, the board and Florida Department of Economic Opportunity acting secretary Meredith Ivey, seeking to block the board\u2019s moves.\n\n>\tThe lawsuit characterizes Wednesday\u2019s vote as the \u201clatest strike\u201d in \u201ca targeted campaign of government retaliation \u2013 orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney\u2019s protected speech.\u201d\n\nGo Mickey!  I\u2019m rooting for you!This is where the fun begins.Lol, DeathSanta stepped on the booby trap and they snapped the waiting lawsuit bear trap on him.\n\nQuality popcorn moment.Yeah, how is this not a flagrant first amendment rights issueWell, that\u2019s going to be an easy one for Disney.You don't fuck with the house of the mouse. ... Mickey has a dark side and Ronny is about to find out.I thought this guy was supposed to be smart. Or dangerous, or something. Lol. (Walks away whistling steam boat bill)That was the first thing I looked for in this article. DeSantis could only win this case with fuckery from one of his judges.Will the taxpayers in florida be on the hook for Desantis's legal defence? I dont really understand how that works.It was always going to be because the root of the cause of action was going to be based on the first amendment. It also benefits Disney in terms of the Judicial processThis is where pudding fingers really made a rookie mistake. Like 1900 of these districts in Florida and he didn't go after a SINGLE other one? Yeah, Ronny D is fucked.I thoroughly enjoyed their reply - not in the link provided, but can be found on Yahoo's coverage of this.  Specifically this line - which is IMBEDDED in the constitution.\n\n\"In America, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind.\"\n\nFull Text:\n\n\"Disney regrets that it has come to this,\" the complaint continued. \"But having exhausted efforts to seek a resolution, the Company is left with no choice but to file this lawsuit to protect its cast members, guests, and local development partners from a relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain State officials.\"\n\n\"A company has a right to freedom of speech just like individuals do,\" Iger said at the time, describing DeSantis' policies as \"anti-business\" and \"anti-Florida.\"\n\n\"Disney finds itself in this regrettable position because it expressed a viewpoint the Governor and his allies did not like,\" Wednesday's complaint reads.\n\n\"Disney wishes that things could have been resolved a different way. But Disney also knows that it is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the State\u2019s retaliation\u2014a stand smaller businesses and individuals might not be able to take when the State comes after them for expressing their own views. In America, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind.\"\n\nLink:\n\n[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-files-lawsuit-against-ron-desantis-alleging-targeted-campaign-of-government-retaliation-163236043.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-files-lawsuit-against-ron-desantis-alleging-targeted-campaign-of-government-retaliation-163236043.html)They basically have the next ten steps prepared and ready.I noticed that. Not even sure it\u2019s legal for DeSantis\u2019 board to invalidate an agreement between a private business and a previous board, but legality has never stopped Republicans in the past.Attorneys are good attorneys if they're paying attention this closely and sue THIS promptly.Disney is playing expert level Chess while DeSantis thinks the game is pin the tail on the donkey.Disneys attorneys have probably had drafts of this ready to go since the beginning, and kept adding to it as DeSantis kept changing shit. They were just waiting for the board to vote on this.They immediately made the \u201cheadset\u201d gesture, indicating to the umpire that they will be challenging the callTaxpayers of Florida will be paying for the damages.They probably had the lawsuit ready to be filed as soon as these agreements were scrapped. They've had it written and stamped just waiting for this. Ron is about to fill his britches.It's gonna be really really funny when the big victory lap he took when they first dismantled the board comes back to ruin him in courtThe poor associate who had to read DeSantis\u2019 book for that citationThis reminds me of that Jon Steward podcast where his guest noted that some case (I think maybe a recent case against Trump) was so entirely winnable that it could never be taught in law school.\n\nAnother one for the pile, I guess.The Rise of the Nazg\u00fbl.When Disney didn't sue at the very beginning of this idiotic tantrum, I figured they were going to compile a laundry list first.>Disney played this smart. Really smart. \n\nWell it really helps that DeSantis is playing it so very stupid.a few years ago republicans : you can't force companies to work for gay people, that's a choice.  \n\n\nflorida republicans: That company is chosing to work with gay people, we can't allow that choice.It's almost as if they have no actual principles, just the pursuit of raw power.I\u2019m sure you can find a bookie somewhere to take those odds lolBonus point, discovery in this case will be going on later this year and early next year, right around the time primary campaigning is gearing up. \n\nNot the best optics to have all the emails that probably have discussions on 'dunking on disney' and 'totally not running for office but running for office' on the same thread being shown off by Disney, and you bet their lawyers will be looking to make as much public as possible.One can only hope \ud83e\udd1eNot just Disney.  Every business and trade group in the country is on Disney's side with this.  We're talking about RIDONKULOUS amounts of money that goes to lobbyists and lawyers, and all of it will be turned against DeSantis.  The business community cannot allow this precedent to stand, for government to be able to invalidate lawful contracts.  PhRMA, manufacturers, big tech, unions, big oil, energy, private prisons, real estate agents, auto dealers, farmers... Literally every special interest group in the country will be with Disney on this.DeSantis wasn't counting on being around.  \n\nMeaning if the board he appointed just kept their mouth shut then no one would have been the wiser for months.  The legal opinion to the new board would not have been public knowledge.  DeSantis would have looked like the big man and it would have leaked out later. \n\nNow, just like saying he was going to 'dissolve' Reedy Creek (he couldn't) - his ego is pushing him to say more and more.>...this case could ruin DeSantis\u2019 political future...  \n  \nDoubtful. This is the party of \"We're All Domestic Terrorists\" that runs on the platform of gripping women by their genitals.[deleted]What\u2019s funny is they cited Citizens United as part of their free speech claim.Yup discovery is going to be super fun. \n\nThing is, Disney doesn\u2019t even need to do discovery. They can just play videos of desantis publicly saying it, point to the screen, tell the federalist appointed judge who is basically corporate owned, that they, as a corporation, are being targeted. \n\nEven if they lose this one, they will appeal. \n\nThere is no way desantis wins this one. I hope they are going after him personally - he needs financial ruin.His motives are in the public record. He didn't bother hiding his retaliation.It's not really a secret though, is it? He held press conferences announcing that he was punishing Disney for expressing their political opinion, so it's not like they need to carefully dig through his text messages for proof. \n\nI'd assume the lawsuit will be more about whether or not his actions were illegal, not whether or not his actions occurred.I thought about this and I am all for anyone defending themselves from abuse of power.  I may not like Disney, but in this particular case I can root for them because the result has implications on all of us.\n\nIt is like rooting for Darth Vader against Palpatine.  I can then root for Luke against Darth Vader.As mega-corps go, at least Disney have to make some appearance of being consumer friendly, as their products are 100% optional. It's not like food or energy companies that you have no choice but to consume.\"Man I wish politicians would stand up to corporations more\"\n\n*Monkey's paw curls*Yep. Being against mega corps doesn't mean we can't still recognize an abuse of government power, which is still worse. From day 1, DeSantis hasn't even tried to hide that he's targeting Disney because of their dissent. We shouldn't accept that no matter what entity is on the receiving end.If the fascists can use their power to fuck with Disney, they can certainly do it to me. What if I want my gaming shop to put on a drag show? Is the government going to come down on me?Eh, not really. DeSantis is using the power of Florida\u2019s government to punish Disney for exercising their 1A rights (have to flip corporate personhood back on them), something expressly forbidden in the Constitution. If DeSantis were to succeed in his quest to punish Disney, then he can and will do it to any other corporation or person/group he wants (an actual scenario of \u201cif they can do it to him, they can do it to you\u201d that the reds loves to crow about), especially after he becomes president.\n\nAnybody that wants to continue to enjoy their 1A rights and not further relegate the Constitution to toilet paper *should* be rooting for Disney like a sports team in this specific instance. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in bed with corporations, it just means you understand that what DeSantis is doing in Florida (and not just to Disney) is wholly anti-American, anti-freedom, and anti-business.I find it fitting, really, that a problem that conservatives are solely responsible for creating is now biting them in the ass.Let's be honest. We're rooting *against* DeSandtits.He has awoken a sleeping giantI was thinking the same thing. And honestly these corporations also need to learn: sure you probably enjoyed all the stupid loopholes and breaks some of these pos corrupt politicians gave you but maybe it\u2019s time to stop supporting fascists so you actually can operate in a state/nation with decent governance even if it means maybe you outta pay your fair share.\n\nJfc.>First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out\u2014because I was not a socialist.  \n>  \n>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out\u2014because I was not a trade unionist.  \n>  \n>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out\u2014because I was not a Jew.  \n>  \n>Then they came for me\u2014and there was no one left to speak for me.  \n>  \n>\u2014Martin Niem\u00f6ller\n\nI am defending the fundamental right of people and their businesses to be free from the oppression of the Government.Same way they claim to be pro-life while supporting war, unregulated guns, and the death penalty.Because they only care about THEIR free speech.  The ability to say shitty things about other people without harm (to them) is way more important than our ability to say people should be left the fuck alone to live their lives in peace.  Hypocrisy is their baseline.Because they're hypocrites and fascistsBecause they\u2019re fascist trash, their free speech hypocrisy is just another weapon use against their \u201cenemies\u201dIt\u2019s obvious, they use buzz words publicly without comprehending the meaning behind them in contrast with their own policy and political action. \n\nTrump polarized the right into authoritarian morality zealots and it likely will result in a major left shift for the country come post 2024. Should that happen we should thank trump for being so dumb it enlightened the world to see how horrible conservative politics are for mental health and the pursuit of happiness.It's *Disney*. Not wanting to be on the wrong end of their lawyers is so mythical everyone in the US jokes about it.\n\nRonnie done goofed.So you\u2019re saying the 3rd lawyer who you didn\u2019t name could potentially be Lucifer\u2019s personal lawyer that sued God and Won.\n\nGotcha.There\u2019s a reason Disneys lawyers are called the Nazg\u00fbl in the industry. Like that\u2019s their **ACTUAL** nickname\u2026 Among other lawyers\u2026 who practice law\u2026\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Enough.\"\"The bodies the mouse buried that day lay the foundation for what Florida is now\"this idea.. this mental picture.. you are making america great again..I don\u2019t want to eat the governor\u2019s coats.Could they argue that he\u2019s clearly operating outside of the boundaries of his role as Governor? Make him personally liable?And the really bonkers ones still think Trump won the election.This was clearly a case of giving them more rope to hang themselves with. They had the lawsuit written and ready to go as soon as the board voted to nullify their agreement.\n\nAnd the rationale they used to nullify it, saying that Disney was trying to take away their power and therefore they aren't valid, has fatal flaw that not only did they not have that power at the time, the law that brought the new board into existence hadn't even *passed* yet when the agreements were made. They can't argue Disney tried to take away their power when there was no legal basis at the time for believing that the new board would even exist.Especially since the fact that Disney filed their suit so quickly that DeSantis didn't even get any time on the news cycle before his move got completely overshadowed. Any time where the narrative was DeSantis getting control of Reedy Creek is gone and the ball is right back in Disney's court.Haha, when thinking about how he would respond, I could clearly see yet another robot malfunction moment incoming.Mickey's too late for *that*, but there's plenty of other shit he can grab.[deleted]I miss Phil HartmanThat was a right pretty speech, sir. But I ask you, what is a contract? Webster's defines it as \"an agreement under the law which is unbreakable.\"\"Which is unbreakable\"!\n\n...excuse me, I must use the restroom.Oh, don't worry, some high salary private attorneys will be brought in at the Florida tax payers expense.He definitely has been, and it's satisfying watching this giant pussy realize he fucked with the absolute wrong mouseJust checked, the only DeSantis news is about Trump potentially naming DeSantis his VP.I cannot imagine how discovery hurts Disney here.Thing is, Disney is alleging a \u201ctargeted campaign of government retaliation\" and it's going to be impossible for Rob to claim otherwise when he's on video doing literally that many times. I'm no lawyer but he and his goons are probably very fucked.I can finally start eating this popcornHe's done enough fucking around lately. Now would be nice to find out all the trouble he's gonna have to deal withShorty seems dumb enough to try and claim executive privilege over comments he made at a press conference.You can't claim executive privilege for violations of civil rights. Also, you can't claim privilege over comments and actions made in public, which is what this is about.*Arasaka Corporation approves this message.*Heck, the actual paper the documents are on probably smell like cinnamon and the innocence of childhood. \ud83d\ude04Well, corporate lawyers are on a whole different ballgame than political lawyers.I don\u2019t get why any conservative would be on Ron\u2019s side here. Aren\u2019t they supposed to be the most staunch defenders of the constitution (particularly free speech) and free enterprise?Yeah this is an open and shut case. They can just show up in court with every publicly recorded video of him saying he\u2019s targeting Disney and that\u2019s pretty much a rap. \n\nDesantis is going to get taken to the cleaners and be reminded who *actually* runs this country. He bit the hand that feeds him.Everyone kept asking, why haven't Disney sued?? Like come on, you had to know they were just letting DeSantis & crew lay out more and more rope. You don't take something to court until you're sure it's a slam dunk, if you're smart.  \n\n\nDisney's lawyers are very smart.\"The Mouse always wins\" - Mr. HouseRight, but this is the wrong fight to have. It looks silly on the face of it, considering the fight is *only* about endorsing gay rights or a gay lifestyle, and that culture war has been settled. \n\nI mean, a vote for DeSantis is a vote for \"we've had enough of the gays being out and open about it,\" and that is going to be his only brand. How urgent is this kind of a policy change?If having lawsuits against you is the mark of a fighter the GOP you are never out fighting Trump. Trump is the lawsuit GOAT Desantis would have Better luck getting in the ring with prime Mike Tyson.he's making himself look like a fool by continually being a step behind Disney.There\u2019s a significant difference between looking like a fighter and looking like you got your ass kicked.That's the funny bit. He probably doesn't give a rat's ass about gay people, but wants to be seen as hating them. Does that make it worse or just more pathetic?...And he already has the proper boots for his Princess attire.He keeps saying that, but he won't be able to gaslight the court like he does with Faux News viewers.While I agree discovery will be interesting, I think it\u2019s mostly going to be Disney pointing to various public recordings and going \u201cthere it is *again*, he\u2019s targeting us directly\u201d.Trump is going to publicly humiliate him with this.That\u2019s his whole retaliatory MO. Often his actions don\u2019t have teeth but cause\nchilling effects.With the broken broomstick from Fantasia>Disney is going to fuck DeSantis raw.\n\none wonders if he's going to enjoy it as much as I enjoy them fucking my wallet several times a year.....  Go Disney!Yes, state funds are used to defend against the suit. The state already has attorneys on payroll, but there will likely be other costs the state (taxpayers) will have to pay, too.[deleted]TLDR: *loading shotgun* \"Shame..\"This will be a 1st amendment violation 100%. Disney has this easilyI like how they tried to hit deSantis where it hurts. 'anti-business', 'anti-florida', 'DeSantis is coming for you and your small businesses' etc.\n\nWe all know who they are talking to here, and it's not DeSantis.How comically evil do you have to be to make Disney the freaking good guys by comparison.Disney: \"*Look what you made me do.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's no way this doesn't end with DeSantis crying in his underpants under the shower.> But Disney also knows that it is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the State\u2019s retaliation\n\nThat is an understatement. But, I like how--in context--Disney is pulling a Steve Rogers and pretending to fight for the little guys. Granted, what they said is absolutely true, but they're really comparing apples to oranges.This is the crux of the matter. I've read that Pudding Fingers is well educated, but I'm not seeing evidence of that in practice.\n\nWhat exactly does he think he has to gain by fighting with one of America's most beloved institutions? The MAGA nuts love their Orange Cheesus, and he's going nowhere, so who's going to be impressed by fighting with Disney?I have the feeling like Disney is holding the legal equivalent of a handful of Reverse, Draw-2 and Draw-4 Wild cards while poor Ronnie sits there unsuspecting.DeFacist didn't even hide the retaliatory nature of his actions against Disney. And the Constitution explicity prohibits invalidating legal contracts. But a Federal court will be less biased than the corrupt state courts.Contracts generally can't be cancelled by one side unless the contract specifically says that's allowed (usually with penalties). If one party believes the terms of the contract to be so egregious it's unenforceable then they can either sue to have the court nullify the contract or they can breach the contract themselves and dare the other party to sue. The board has opted for the latter so that's why Disney is suing.In comparison, Florida officials couldn't even be bothered to show up to open meetings where the previous board set up these agreements in plain sight.Not just good attorneys, but also a strong PR team. If Disney hadn't filed right away, the big narrative today would have been DeSantis pulling back Disney's development rights. By acting quickly, Disney robbed DeSantis of a good news cycle and preserved the upper hand.\n\nI'm sure that Legal, Corp Dev, and Comms were all working very closely on this.Disney has the best attorneys money can buy.\n\nRon is going to learn all about it in detail.Disney attorneys don't fuck around. They're notorious for being some of the most cutthroat corporate lawyers out there. Sucks to be DeSantis right now.You can\u2019t just declare a contract null. This whole thing is ridiculous. Desantis looks like an idiotDisney has dunked on him so many times already I'm starting to feel bad. Their legs have to be getting tired from jumping over him over and over.\n\nEvery single thing he's tried they've made him look even dumber than the last. \n\n* Tries to revoke their special district and gets blocked.\n* Tries to revoke all special districts created in a very specific time window (of course only Disney is effected) and finds out the state would have to take on the billions in debt\n* Decides not to revoke the district but to replace the governing board with his own. Before they take power Disney's board gives up all decision making power but retains maintenance duties\n* Passes laws to undo one single action by one board in one special district and gets sued 30 seconds laterHell, Ron and his gang have been saying what they were going to do. The lawyers probably had the complaint drawn up and were just sitting by the computer, ready to file it.Yup. They clearly had everything prepped ahead of time, which means, at least so far, they were expecting thisDisney has WAY better attorneys than Florida, Ron or the GOP.  They also have very deep pockets.   I think there are some state legislators and Ron who are going to learn a hard lesson in the next few election cycles.You think the army of Disney lawyers don't have templates loaded up? They were ready before the meeting finished.To be fair, there's a huge ass involved.I'm a lawyer. There is no probably. You can't write a complaint in a few minutes. Not even a boilerplate one. \n\nThe fact that this was done within minutes means they not only had one written and ready to go, but they had someone in the courthouse waiting on phone call from whoever was at the meeting to hear the vote.There's a lot of references to DeSantis' memoir in the lawsuit as well.It's gonna be really really sad when every single candidate the GQP wants to run for president is drowning in lawsuits.\n\nIt's a shame they can't just be decent people. It's really not so bad if they'd just give it a shot.Most of his laws have been blocked by the courts.  You just never hear about it because he makes a very noisy victory lap when it passes.  \n\nSo much Florida money is being spent defending and funding this one man's crusade to be President that its disgusting.As an associate in a UK firm, I love this kind of job.  Beats paperwork!\n\nEDIT: Likely something they politely told the trainee to do though...`ctrl+f \"disney\"` probably did a lot of heavy lifting.Hey, I'd read that book if it were all billable hours.Just imagine the poor intern who actually had to write itIt was the Dominion defamation suit they just settled for an obcene amount of moneyIt's like the people who act shocked when the guy who *asked Russia to help his election campaign on live TV* was suspected of colluding with Russia.They were allowing the paper trail to develop. Disney\u2019s litigation team makes Florida\u2019s attorneys look like, well\u2026 Florida.That and get the contracts in place to add contract law into the suit. Had they sued at the start, they risked the DeSantis crony board causing issues. With the contracts in place, that board's hands will likely be tied for the entire suit.Sun Tzu: \"Never interrupt your opponent while he is in the middle of making a mistake.\"Iger went out of his way saying how he was willing to discuss the situation with the Governor before any lawsuits were needed. Ronny D said no.\"He's Trump but smart\"\n\nNow that you've beaten this pigeon at chess, let me introduce you to another pigeon, *but smart.*Disney is about to show wannabe-fascist DeSantis who holds the *real* power in this country: massive multinational megacorporations. All these years that the GOP spent funneling more and more power to corporations is about to bite Squeaky Ron in the ass.Ugh, at this point just admit you hate us.This is why DeFascist is trying to repeal our Sunshine laws.It's all I want for Christmas.This is a good point. Disney is not fighting this alone and it affects all business in the USA.This is similar to the abortion pill ban, where a religious extremist judge randomly blocks prior FDA approval.  People can\u2019t develop medicine in an environment like that.  Republicans are just terrible for business.He still isn\u2019t counting on not being around. \n\nAll his bullshit is just to get the gop nomination.Conservatives only like winners though. Disney has been a losing battle for DeSantis from the start and even his donors have lost confidence in him because of it. Once the primaries really start, he\u2019ll get hit on this constantly by other Republicans and his credibility will be shot.ianal obviously but isnt Citizens United a major reason why this is such a slam dunk? from what i understand Citizens United gives corporations the constitutional privileges of individual citizens, and harming an individual for saying something you dont like is definitely a violation of the 1st ammendmentOh they\u2019ll go to discovery. It\u2019s gonna be billable hours that Rhonda will be ordered to pay>Thing is, Disney doesn\u2019t even need to do discovery.\n\nThe don't need to, but why stop at slaughtering him when they could also run him through a woodchipper?[deleted]Why not both? Public record and a deep dive into every communication between him and the cronies he appointed to the board.[removed]Apt you'd use a metaphor owned by Disney. :)Giant, public-facing, corps like Disney generally align their best interests with their customers. If they alienate their customers, they lose money which then upsets their shareholders.\n\nCompanies like Disney have massive LGBT fanbases, so it's in their interest to go hard on cases like this because it keeps their customers happy. \n\nI doubt there's a huge overlap in people aggressively pro-\"Don't Say Gay\" and Disney fans, so Disney cares less about keeping them happy.\n\nIt's rare, but sometimes capitalism works in the public's favour.*Mickey's paw curls*The government wouldn't come down on you. They're too homophobic for that.I think the point is that we are all rooting for the giant mega corp instead of the elected representatives, and the fact that there's good reason for that is fucked up.To add to the point about doing this to other businesses. Disney can only take this to court because they can *afford lawyers*. I guarentee you if desantis was fucking around with some small local business that didn\u2019t have the financial capabilities to legally fight back, he could basically say the law is whatever they want and nobody would know until months or even years later because it would just get swept under the rug.The snake is eating itself, as it were.And opposing universal healthcare (or just a public option).And \u201csaving\u201d the children from drag queens and trans people, while not only allowing guns to become the #1 cause of death of children but also opposing any gun control measures.\n\nIt still baffles and pains me that Sandy Hook happened over a decade ago, and nothing changed, and more ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN have died since.\n\nBut good god, don\u2019t let them see the horrors of fake boobs and a man in a dress! How could they survive?!Republicans are pro-fetus and clearly not pro-life any more than Fox is news, which it's not.Exactly. When they say \u201cfree speech\u201d what they mean is \u201cI\u2019m sad I can\u2019t use slurs in public without getting called out for it.\u201dDisney is going to bury Ronnie's political career, dig it up, piss on it, then bury it again. What was this dude thinking?Well I can't blame you.  And I can't correct it now.Absolutely crusted over with dry puddingYou can't sign legislation that affects Disney outside the role as Governor so, no.If Disney can provide any direct evidence showing that DeSantis ordered any action that violated their civil rights, then yes, he could potentially be held personally liable.I move for a bad court thingy.And still lose\n\nDisney\u2019s lawyers are some of the best in the businessMost of them over there don\u2019t give a shit about desantis anymore. With trumps attacks and Disney making him look like a chump, many of them have quietly \u201cforgot\u201d about him. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is simply is never mentioned or barely mentioned at all.Theres 2 posts about it with like 12 comments each, the general consensus is not talking about it. Only real discussion is one guy explaining the first amendement differences between reddit banning you and the Govt going after you. 90% of them are idiots\"It will reveal all the SECRETS about the DEEP STATE and how Disney is CONSPIRING with RADICAL LEFTISTS to push their WOKE AGENDA!!!\"\n\n/s (hopefully obvious)In fact, the potential discovery in this case is going to absolutely fuck DeSantis. He's made it pretty clear this was about political retaliation in his public remarks. Just imagine what has been said in private.Florida is (in process of) passing laws targeting anyone running a monorail that crosses county lines.\n\nThis is a slam dunk for Disney to claim they\u2019re being targeted by legislation, which violates constitutional clauses against bills of attainder and ex post facto legislation.\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious how badly they\u2019re doing at this.>he and his goons are probably very fucked\n\nOne can dream...My hope for Ron \u201cKinkyboots\u201d Desantis is that he goes through the rest of his miserable life getting brutally mocked and laughed at any time he steps outside of his house.With Disney characters as watermarks.It was all facade to hide their fascist ways. Conservatism was the closest vessel for them to latch onto. I think they're way beyond that now.Mostly importantly he\u2019s soiling himself in the eyes of his biggest donors. Business folks don\u2019t take too kindly to politicians who step out of place.YesAnd cost his state millions in legal bills. Of course the law firms are also major donors of his.DeSantis is that kid who has never, EVER been told no in his whole life. I can't wait for that clown to just get humiliated in court.According to all the muppets on /r/Conservative, Florida is taking action against multiple special districts and never once names Disney as a target, so it\u2019s just Disney crying about losing all their special privileges rather than retaliation.Pretty sure the law targetting them said something like \"all special districts before 1967\" (which ONLY applies to Disney)What a time to be alive. I'm rooting for Disney.https://i.imgur.com/vsvOTbs.jpgArticle 1 also specifically states that you can't make laws targeted at single entities (corporations are people now).  Or retroactive laws.  Or laws negating contracts that have already been signed.    \n\nYou don't even have to step into the bill of rights to know how illegal this shit is.>This will be a 1st amendment violation 100%. Disney has this easily\n\nAll of the people who complain whenever someone is \"cancelled\" or de-monetized need to pay attention to this case. This is the kind of thing the 1st Amendment is supposed to prevent.So where does the Florida public stands on all of this? It's really hard for me to believe that the average citizen living in his average suburb in Florida supports this idiot governor against Disney. But I live in a rational state so maybe I'm just really out of touch.\n>We all know who they are talking to here\n\nAnd those people aren't reading this*puts on tinfoil hat *\n\nMaybe DeSantis was paid by Disney to be comicly evil so they could convince liberals that corporate personhood is good and government oversight of companies is bad.That is a mental image I could have gone the rest of my days without.Well, they do own Steve Rodgers now lol.Because while Ron just wants headlines, Disney wants results. Forcing bullshitters to back up their shit is one of life\u2019s great pleasures.He is still working on if he will be the thimble or shoe that fool ain\u2019t even playing the same game at this pointHe\u2019s not even in the country, the timing couldn\u2019t be better.[deleted]That is just basic local gov't 101.  \n\nSure we are now going to have to foot the bill for a high expense lawyer to appease Ronnie's egoDisney has been doing PR for years and years. The amazing thing is their actions so far aren't even a masterclass; they're basic due diligence. All the offended republicans should have seen this coming long ago. Disney's not going down without a fight and right now my money's on Disney.They probably had some intern sitting in a car outside the court for the last X number of weeks, just waiting on the call to walk in and file it.[removed]They had 100 contingency plans loaded and ready in the chamber. Iger just issued Order 66, thats it.\n\nThe hand picked board couldn't even attend hand over meetings. This is a battle of ruthless corporate overloads vs. inept state government. And sadly I have to root for corporate overlords this round.I'm not normally one to cheer on a mega-corp, but I love how well Disney is controlling the narrative on this. I see no reasonable\\* way for DeSantis to come out on top against Disney. He either has to double down and lose hard in court against the most vicious lawyers in existence or back away with his tail between his legs. Either way, ol' 45 is going to pounce on him with all the strength of a feeble lion and erode his support even more.\n\n\\*Key word: ***reasonable***.They've also hit the right tone in their filings, saying stuff like \"we regret it's come to this\", and \"since we have the resources, it falls to us to stand up for principle.\"\n\nAnd their timing hits right as Desantis' not-a-campaign campaign is faltering.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if they've gamed out the entire litigation, and DeSantis' potential responses, in advance.Disney is one of the greatest, if not the greatest law firm, media Corp AND lobbying group in the world. \n\nDeSantis picked a legal fight for the PR to help his political campaign. \n\nThis was a tactical error.Motherfucker thought he could fuck with the people that own the Death Star, and get away with it.Someone compared Disneys attorneys to the Nazgul in another thread. DeSantis and Florida are in for a world of hurtIt probably sucks to be DeSantis all of the time.DeSantis is betting on his four judges on the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nEdit- Nevermind. It's a federal lawsuit.The legal complaint is signed by :\n\n- Daniel M. Petrocelli (who defeated the Justice Department when they tried to block the AT&T and Time Warner merger, and also won $8.5 million damages for the family of one of O.J Simpson's victims)\n- Jonathan D. Hacker (who, from what I'm reading online, has argued six cases in the US Supreme Court).\n\nDisney ain't playing!I have an old HS friend that is an entertainment lawyer in Fla, and has had good dealings with Disney in the past, and even he said around those parts Disney Lawyers are commonly referred to as Death Eaters. He said if everything is above board, they are great, very down to business people to deal with, but if there is some fuckery afoot, they have sniffed it out, and prepared five ways to fuck you back for trying to get something past them. He is adamant that you never fuck with Disney lawyers, they do not lose.Desantis IS an idiot.It also looks retaliatory for a process they followed to the letter. That's where Desantis is cooked. They baited him, and like a floppy ass trout he bit.\"I declare bankruptcy!\"Um, excuse me, they now have the right to inspect Disney's monorail every three years! You can't just leave off a *huge win* like that!\n\n(/s in case it isn't obvious, I can never tell these days)... yes... that is how good lawyers work.Disney\u2019s lawyers don\u2019t even need to win this (but they probably can easily).\n\nThey just need to keep this going for as long as it takes to embarrass DeSantis out of the race, and probably out of governorship.Ronny forgot Rule number 1: don't fuck with the mouseLawyer here as well, and I'll second this statement: this is like watching Magnus Carlsen play chess against a Eurasian beaver.Only correction - federal case. They didn't need to be at the courthouse, they just had to sit at their computer with their CM/ECF page fired up and ready and clicked the button when the vote went through.Poor bastards had to read itWouldn't be the first time.  Trump settled a lawsuit for fraud for $25M after being elected last time.  Having to pay millions of dollars for fraud is not a dealbreaker for the trust of most Americans.Especially *Disney lawyer* billable hours.That's right, that was the one.Imagine how ruthlessly, viciously competent you have to be to be Disney's lawyers.And the first thing they did after DeSantis swapped board members was to neuter the entire board itself. The Mouse is coming for you DeSantis.This always reminds me of the Obama/Romney debate. \"Please proceed, Governor.\"That's what I thought about him, until this Disney debacle. He's clearly not a smart man.\n\nSo he's not Trump but smart, rather he is Trump but a little more focused, and aware of what his political position is, which is still a way more dangerous version of Trump.\n\nTrump could have been far worse for the country if he was just a little more focused, and aware of where he was supposed to stand ideologically.They do.  Routinely?They literally bought cases of beer and shot guns at it just to show you how \"valued\" you areI thought at first DeSantis was a more competent authoritarian than Trump, driven by actual conservative (aka \"dogshit\") ideology, where Trump was/is just a massive narcissistic egomaniac.\n\nNow, I think I may actually be wrong, and that of the two, Trump is the smarter of the two - and that both are actually just narcissists, rather than principled ideologues.Well, that and Trump in an orange jumpsuit and a shaved head.Imagine doing all this and then losing to Biden lol>\tConservatives only like winners though\n\nThey are obsessed with Donald Trump, one of history\u2019s most prolific losers.It's all about attitude though. Trump is a loser, bankrupting himself ten times every year, taking fool proof industries like gambling and failing to profit. But he's cruel to the right people in the right ways.\n\n\"Winning\" is all about social dominance hierarchy 'tudes. If you've got good supremacist vibes, you're a winner no matter what any court says.Pretty much.  Thing is conservatives were totally on board with CU.  And now  Desantis et al have gone after Disney and violated their 1st amendment rights.  It\u2019s kinda funny how CU could be one thing that bites them in the ass.> arming an individual for saying something you dont like is definitely a violation of the 1st ammendment\n\nIf the gov't is harming that person, yes.  Not in regular interactions.Yeah, given the opportunity to build a fire, Disney doesn't stop with a large pile of logs and gas. They're the type of company to start a forest fire with Napalm just to make extra sure their target is burned to ash.Lots and lots of child porn or gay porn.\n\nEdit:though it seems republicans have moved beyond the point we're they are closeted gay and are now more likely to be closeted pedos.Let\u2019s not venture too much into fictionRedemption is a funny thing. Remember, they were anti-LGBTQ for a time... and then had a change of heart in the 90s. They are going to be hero and villain in different spheres of influence.   \n\n\nMy beefs with them are copy right extensions and suing people who fall under fair use.Acquired, even.A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.*a single, solitary 'hyuck' echos in the night*Very often the publicly anti gay Republicans end up caught privately engaging in gay sex acts so the odds are actually decent.and free school lunchOr food assistance or healthcare or homeless shelters and on and on and onSandy Hook proved to me that nothing will ever be done. If nothing changed after that, there is no hope. Dead children are an acceptable price to pay to have their guns.Well first he would have to actually thinkJust leave it because it\u2019s awesome.Here's the thing, Disney doesn't even need the best in the business. \"here are the governor's statements about doing exactly this thing because of a statement, further more, the statement about gay folks have nothing to do with how we run our business, monorail or anything else. If we had said, \"fuck monorail safety\", then sure, maybe the government should look into our monorail.. but we said that gay people can exist, which they legally can.  so we said a legal thing to say and the government is pursuing punishment to our company through government action. see governor speech, see congress speech, see laws.\"\n\nThe best in the business will do that and be ON TOP OF IT. They wil be ontime, everything will be letter of the law and will leave florida in a weird place that if they agree with the laws then many businesses will be burnt.... and if they disagree with the laws... welp, overturned and probably a suing.  \n\n\nEDIT: just read the suit. Yup. they did all of the above, and HARD. \"yeah, we can enter into agreements, if they can just void agreements for protected speech that will be bad for everyone, especially since agreements/contracts are a thing, that means the state is depriving us of a thing with no ability to debate, argue or even get fair market value\"  \n\n\nIf this is allowed... oh boy. businesses are all going to be very afraid. \"oh, your company  contacted with a company that celebrated the birthday of a gay worker... oh, they hired a gay voice actor.... oops... we are just going to tear that up for you\". It would be just a hop skip and a small jump to \"oh, you hired a jew or muslim... or the wrong kind of christian\"  \n\n\nHell, even if Florida gets that, they won't like it because that means this could be used against anything they believe in...It doesn't help when your clients are repeatedly on record affirming the claims of the suit. Or when retaliatory laws are so tightly tailored to only apply to Disney in the entire state. \n\nDisney doesn't even need quality lawyers to win this because DeSantis has been acting like he is above all laws so didn't bother to stop and think if something was even remotely legal in his very public war against Disney. So now he gets to be embarrassed in a national stage for a fight that never needed to happen. And that's where the extremely high quality attorneys come in, to turn it into a blood bath.Disneys lawyers are the seal team 6 of the legal world. I\u2019m a lifelong central Floridian and it\u2019s a widely known fact that most local attorneys will not even take on a client attempting to file suit against Disney.They\u2019ll let anyone get Harvard Law Degree nowadays, eh Ronnie? I hope this move puts his political career in a coffin.>\"67. That same day, Representative Fine said to the Florida House State Affairs Committee: \"You kick the hornet's nest, things come up. **And I will say this: You got me on one thing, this bill does target one company. It targets the Walt Disney Company.**\"This is quite literally in the Constitution. States do not have the power to nullify valid contracts.His Tammany Hall bullshit will only stop when a bigger bully takes him to task.Idk if you've seen the Last Week Tonight segment on DeSantis, but I highly suggest you do.They live in an alternate reality with alternate facts.To be fair, they also think the Election was stolen with *no evidence*...Yeah, it feels wrong to be rooting for a giant megacorp.Crazy how a racist homophobic governmental overreach fascist can unite people to root for an evil exploitative slave labor child abusive megacorp.A right wing extremist activist judge: \u201cI\u2019ll allow it\u201dThat's why I don't get why some of these laws, especially trans ones, are legal. It is not lawful to make a law directed specifically at an individual. In one state, a law would have applied to literally 14 trans student athletes. Regardless of the content, it's not legal to target individuals like that with legislation.>You don't even have to step into the bill of rights to know how illegal this shit is.\n\nIt's such an overreach from DeSantis that it really should bar him from office. He should be removed as governor for this, at the very least, and realistically should be barred from running for any other federal or state position.Those people are just fine with DeSantis' tyrannyPeople can complain all they want. People can choose how to spend their own money. What can\u2019t be done is a state official trying to de-monetized or cancel something they personally don\u2019t agree with.The average supporter of Puddin Fingers wont know this even exists if it never gets reported on Faux News.Miami Herald and a few other outlets have been reporting on how even DeSantis's own GOP state reps are getting tired of his war with Disney...everyone (so far) is still an \"anonymous source\", but already the retired GOP state reps are going on the record.\n\nDeSantis's problem is that, if he continues to fight Disney and lose, he'll continue to gradually lose GOP support as people get tired of the distraction. On the other hand, if he admits defeat, he'll lose GOP support in a hurry as everyone tries to distance themselves from the \"loser Governor that couldn't even defeat Disney\".\n\nHis only hope is to play this out as long as he can and hope for a miracle...As a life-long resident of Florida in my early 40's, I'm embarrassed this guy was elected, and then re-elected by my state. And by no means am I a fan of the mouse house. But given the circumstances, I'm definitely rooting for Disney here. I'm not sure what Desantis' end-game is anyway.... Ruin Disney and/or oust them and tank your state economy? Fucking brilliant...\n\nFlorida is an embarrassment. All we do is flatten wetlands for shitty housing communities and elect fascists. I hope this draws enough national attention so that corporations and small business can see what this guy would do if he was president.> So where does the Florida public stands on all of this? \n\nHere in Orlando, most people I know don't like him if not outright despise him, and I'm in the latter group.\n\nMost of the cities in Florida are blue, but all the surrounding countryside in Florida is a ton of old people who are the prime targets of Fox News and conservative media, and they still have significant numbers, enough to have elected Rhonda Sand Tits.Some of them may not have the ability to.I'm not sure what the right level of oversight is for the state of Florida to have over Disney's district, I'm very open to be persuaded that it should be more than what it was so far.\n\nHowever, DeSantis effort is *very* clearly not a principled stance on corporate regulation but targeted retaliation over free speech that he *clearly* would not apply to another company in the same situation which did not take similar stances.\n\nAs such I think his actions are wrong regardless of whether they'd be correct in a vacuum. Like, I think rich people should pay higher taxes, but if a state decided to tax specific rich people more based on their political stances I would strongly oppose it.Like a bad Disney cartoon.\n\n> \"We'll give you *ONE BILLION DOLLARS* to essentially play the role of Goofy!\"\n\n\n> \"Woohoo sounds great!\"\n\n> \"And then we'll sue you for a measly sum of a scant thousand-million dollars to recoup some losses, and we both come up roses in the end!\"\n\n> \"Coming up roses in the end is *my favorite!*\"He wears thong underwear, with sequins,  fyilol they're literally doing a steve rogers musical at the hyperion now. \n\nas in, literally the musical from the movies about steve rogers.\n\nedit: yes, [the one from hawkeye.](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2023/04/rogers-the-musical-to-premiere-june-30-for-a-limited-time-at-disney-california-adventure-park/)Yeah, it just seems crazy to me that DeSantis decided to attack Disney to generate his headlines. Like, if Disney just erased him from existence I wouldn't be surprised. We're basically a corporate oligarchy and he attacked what is *the* corporation these days. Just seems nuts politically.Yeah, that implies he is attempting to play a more involved game.  This would probably be better as \"working on if he will be the X or the O\" as that is more his speed.Yeah, he's still in Japan, right? Is that somehow part of his book tour, or is he there on \"government business\"?And set the precedence of government over corporations?Try not to be a shitty conservative governor challengeI guess you have to ask if it matters.  I mean, really, it's not like it's going into improving the educational system or the health system is it?  Nope, from outside (thank gawd) every dollar spent on a lawyer is simply one less dollar wasted on migrant busing stunts and private police forces.\n\nYour taxes are sadly going to be wasted by Republican governance no matter what.   You literally are in a \"taxation without representation\" system right now.It's competent corporate behavior, and the lawyers just so happen to be excellent with unlimited resources. Amazing to see the difference in how republicans get their asses handed to them when their competition is corporations with resources and instead of everyday people with gender dysphoria. If only those affected by their draconian social legislation could muster the same density and force of response.It's funny cause Disney's money is also on Disney. Which is a LOT of fucking money.Modern republican's don't understand basic due diligence. It's culture war all the wayYou tell me Disney is suing somebody, literally anybody, and my money is on the mouse and his lawyers.If you've got Disney money, you just rent an office nextdoor.    That way you don't have to worry about where the intern goes to the bathroom or eats lunch, and they can't as easily lose the documents.   Probably find a way to pay less money by deducting it all as a capital expenditure.Federal court is e-filed these daysBro, the Death Star is only one of the 3 circles that make up the Mouse himself. Idk which one it is, but one of the other 2 is a Circle of Hell, and for once, I'm on board with the House of the Mouse.Disneys attorneys are so ruthless that they went after a daycare center for putting Mickey Mouse on a mural. Did DeSantis expect that they somehow wouldn't go after him with the full might of their legal and PR machine?Why must the rest of us suffer, too?And they risk setting precedent that would favor the government over corporations.This is a federal suit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Still not a super-friendly Court, but this will go through the Federal appellate system rather than Florida\u2019s.It's a federal lawsuit, not state.Hmmm \"Florida Approved Monorail\"? \n  \nYa know what? I'm gonna catch the next one.I think the guy you were replying to was just pointing out its common sense. I'd be bigger news, if in the middle of Florida vs Disney, Disney wasn't prepared\n\nLike a blind, dumb, deaf person could've read the writing on this wallDesantis made the same stupid mistakes as Trump.  His ego was hurt and he made public statements outlining that this was retribution for the decissions that Disney made as a private company.\n\nwhen this is done Disney may end up owning all of Florida, not just Reedy Creek.He has term limits if I recall.  He\u2019s been in office since 2019, so he\u2019s out in 27 regardlessAre Eurasian beavers more adept at chess than your average North American beaver?\"Waiting in the courthouse\" is an old saying among lawyers that has held on since the advent of efiling.\n\ne.g., \"You do that counselor. And I'll be waiting in the courthouse.\" \n\nA similar one is \"and I'll be waiting with the clerk's morning coffee.\"\n\nGenerally refers to a lawyer / firm that is notoriously aggressive in filing.Some poor intern or junior attorney, surely.They probably charged $1000/hr to read it, so I'm sure they didn't struggle too much.They even cheered it on! \n\n>\"Haha, he's rich, so he can afford to throw money around for his crimes with no consequences! Take that, libruls!\"\n\n\ud83e\udd14I dated the daughter of one of the lawyers who is partners in a firm Disney uses. \n\nThey\u2019re excellent at their jobs because they\u2019re fucking soulless. And her dad was one of the most petty people I\u2019ve ever met - but he was patient and orchestrated. \n\nSo, I expect this will be fantastic.What's the name of Mr. Burns' head lawyer? The one with the skinny face and the annoying voice? Yeah, that guy,They are like the opposite of trump lawyers, as they actually get paid and are effective.Disney actually did it BEFORE the new board members were appointed. In the two weeks between the Legislature passing the law and the governor signing the law.  So Disney is completely above board because the latest version of the law specifically said the new board had to enforce all the contracts the previous one made... (in order to dodge the financial crush from dissolving RCID)Seriously.  Who's stupid enough to fuck with Disney ?  And DeSantis has a law degree from Harvard.  What an idiot.The board self-neutered right before they were replaced.  They gave their power over to Disney so the incoming members would have none.If you take a shot at the Mouse, you'd best not miss, Hah Hah!\n\n                            _____\n                        .d88888888bo.\n                      .d8888888888888b.\n                      8888888888888888b\n                      888888888888888888\n                      888888888888888888\n                       Y8888888888888888\n                 ,od888888888888888888P\n              .'`Y8P'```'Y8888888888P'\n            .'_   `  _     'Y88888888b\n           /  _`    _ `      Y88888888b   ____\n        _  | /  \\  /  \\      8888888888.d888888b.\n       d8b | | /|  | /|      8888888888d8888888888b\n      8888_\\ \\_|/  \\_|/      d888888888888888888888b\n      .Y8P  `'-.            d88888888888888888888888\n     /          `          `      `Y8888888888888888\n     |                        __    888888888888888P\n      \\                       / `   dPY8888888888P'\n       '._                  .'     .'  `Y888888P`\n          `\"'-.,__    ___.-'    .-'\n              `-._````  __..--'`\n                  ``````So, I think he **was** smarter, but started to let the success go to his head. He got so used to being in charge of Florida where no one was going to stop him or say no, he just expected everyone to roll over to him.\n\nAnd then he kicked Disney to try and make them roll over, and they're hitting him with a \"Call an ambulance, but not for me\"I think he was more competent until recently. But then he decided he needed to outdo Trump instead of being the \u201cmore rational, controlled\u201d option. He wanted the hype and bombastic PR that the MAGA crowd brings and he wasn\u2019t getting that while courting the less intense republicans. \n\n\nTrump knows that you don\u2019t start shit you actually need to follow up on. You just say you will and the cult is happy for that to be their talking point. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do x!\u201dDeSantis got high off his own supply.There is no actual conservative ideology.

Trump is going to eat his lunch.But he tells them that he wins bigly. They get all of their news from a source that hides Trump\u2019s losses. DeSantis is getting dragged through the mud everywhere though.right, good point. and this specific example is obviously a case of the Florida government doing exactly that.It's not child porn.  He was \"documenting genital inspections to ensure the kids weren't being groomed.\"It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.wasnt it the norm in the 90 for corps to be anti-lgbtq?This Darth Disney character is really complex. Hopefully they can take out the death star, or Florida, as Americans refer to it.And assisting with child care.Or environmental protections.I honestly think that wrong kind of Christian line is the ultimate goal for them. The rest of this is just chipping away\"\\[...\\] write exactly what the teacher wants, get the credential, and use it to your advantage.

When Hitler declares war on the Devil, you'd be surprised who you wind up supporting.the only thing you can do in oligopoliesIt's like if evil aliens invaded earth and Lex Luthor championed our defence. I'd be rooting for him but not because I liked him.Care to elaborate on slave labor/child abuse? I'm not a huge fan of some of Disney's copyright fanatism, but wow \"slave labor\" and \"child abuse\"?That's my point.The case was randomly assigned to an Obama nominee who has already been a thorn in the Governors side, so it will definitely be a fair trial. If Florida lose they will have to appeal to the 11th circuit appeals court which has eleven judges nominated by a Dem and 11 judges nominated by a Republican.It's because Republicans have figured out that the fabric of legality really just comes down to a bunch of people agreeing on something, and if you stack the courts with right-wing nutcases, they'll just rule in favor of other lunatics regardless.What's amazing to me is that conservatives by their very nature are supposed to hate government overreach. And if this isn't a clear example of government overreach I don't know what is.I work somewhere where the front office keeps TVs on news all day, unfortunately they show Fox \"entertainment\" instead of actual journalism. I had to sit in the front for a few minutes today and they were *still* blabbering on about Hunter Biden, and complaining that republicans haven't all come to a consensus on how many weeks after conception they should ban abortion from. The usual cognitive dissonance from that lot.DeSantis has so far missed the obvious. Have some kind of meeting with Iger, extract a meaningless concession in exchange for peace, call it a win and move on to scapegoating trans people.Could be worse, the corporate oligarchy could be enabling the fascists.[deleted]Difficulty: Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience.  \n\nIt's so fucking easy to let people live their lives without government interference in basic human and civil rights.

If you are reading this post and you voted for Ron DeSantis to be your governor, you. are. stupid.Specifically this is a free speech thing since DeSantis has been deliberately and publicly targeting Disney because they're \"woke\".Much like the move to vacate the law that he would have to resign to run for POTUS which is due anyday now, he has floated in a couple speeches he may \"need to guide\" Florida a bit longer, so I wouldn't be surprised if the term limit will be the next thing he goes after if the whole POTUS thing fails the way it looks like it will.Are you suggesting Eurasian beavers migrate?North American Beavers are very angry. I watched a show about it as a kid.Possibly the first person to read it since the book's editor. Assuming it had an editor that is.Charged 1000/hr then had a 20/hr paralegal write up the sparknotes for them.Hyper competent lawyers who are excruciatingly exact and  extremely patient are TERRIFYING. I rarely root for a multibillion dollar corporation, but this is one of those times. DeSantis is going to rue the day that he thought he could beat the Mouse.I\u2019m going to have to start keeping more popcorn in my pantry, because this is going to be great.>but he was patient and orchestrated. \n\n\u201cThose skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform; they entice him with something he is certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in strength.\u201d - Sun TzuIt's just \"Blue-Haired Lawyer\".guess he bought it, wait for leaks to come he cheated  his examsThat\u2019s just the thing! You\u2019d think someone with that kind of credentials would be capable of formulating a plan that works. Yet, here we are.You can be much smarter than Trump and still be an idiotEgo is the downfall of many smart people.\n\nThey start surrounding themselves with yes-men and it just fucks with their ability to think critically ever again.My Korean parents love to use a certain saying that roughly translates into \"Don't touch the nasal hairs of a sleeping lion.\" DeSantis shoved his hand up Disney's nostril and fucking *yanked*.His public polling vs Trump is awful, he's down 30 fucking points. He knows this, we know this.\n\nRealistically, if you attribute that differential to *actions* and *statements*, DeSantis' only option is to be louder and more strident.\n\nUnfortunately, he's misapprised that 30 point deficit. It has nothing to do with what either of them have done and everything to do with *who they are*.\n\nTrump is a poor man's idea of a rich man.  Trump is exactly who all of his voters **wish they could be** - a guy who can have or say whatever he wants and face no consequences. A guy who gets all the attention he could ever want for literally no reason at all. He's Bella Swan for middle-aged racist schlubs who peaked in high school. \n\nFucking nobody wants to be Ron DeSantis. His poll numbers are the approximate percentage of the party who  cares about policy at all - and they're STILL people who think those policies should be racist, sexist, and generally selfish to a fault.I think so, tbh. Politics and the media speculation of him fed into it, and I think that plus his personality, which has likely always had a strong narcissistic/egotistical component to it, just sent him.Tucker Carlson and Steven Crowder having their worst weeks ever too.*siighhh* unzipsThere are many legal strategies that some would deem\u2026unnaturalPretty much. IIRC it was usually don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell for most big corps. Disney added recognition for domestic partners in the 90s or 2000s when most of the rest did.Have they got the blueprints that show desantis' exhaust port weakness yet?And trying to destroy Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC.Or sheltering homeless veteransThe thing is, that this should scare the hell out of the majority of christians. Sure, some of the baptists and some of the evangelicals would probably be fine.... but catholics have been here before and they are usually on the chopping block... and the methodists/lutherans and more \"chill\" groups should be SCARED.Not surprising that his stance is \"I proudly and deliberately refused to learn anything.\"\n\nI mean, if you disagree with \"[pretty much] everything\" your professors said, you just broadly disagree with laws.\n\nIt's such a comically absolutist stance that makes absolutely zero sense to say (unless of course you're not concerned with FACTS and LOGIC but are concerned with virtue signaling to your base about how you're \"anti-establishment.\")For fuck sake, we should all use thigh food from now on.*If Hitler invaded hell I would make at least a favourable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.*\n\n\nWinston Churchill\"Jesus is doing his best, but he's no Hitler.\"\n\nYour comment just reminded me of a line from the *Preacher* tv series, season 4.I, for one, choose to hail Satan. \n\nIt really does feel odd to be pro-disney, given their general donation record and treatment of their employees, but I also can't fathom why DeSantis is doubling down so hard on one of the largest drivers of cashflow in this state. I mean, I know why he did it, but I don't know why he kept at it once he realized how much he's put into jeopardy, other than stupid, blind ego... which, honestly, is also not a surprise.\n>When Hitler declares war on the Devil, you'd be surprised who you wind up supporting\n\nSsssmokin'> THE giant megacorp. \n\nThe Dutch East India Company!?> THE giant megacorp.\n\nThis is wrong.\n\nDisney is the behemoth of IP -- but as megacorps go it isn't that big. That's important when you're weighing lesser evils. And against a fascist governor looking to become president, Disney absolutely is the lesser evil here.Somewhere, far down below us, Ayn Rand is smilingThe bell has been rung. The real fight now begins.Also, *most* judges do have a code of ethics, regardless of who appointed them or political party. Trump's classified document appeal was eventually struck down unanimously by a court of mostly trump-appointed judges. And Disney is presenting arguments closely aligned with republican beliefs (government overreach, corporations as people, etc).It's amazing to me nevertheless how many people will vote and choose in favor of someone whose politics they agree with over what's actually personally beneficial to them and their families and their friends and their neighbors and their relatives and people they've never met and never will meet.\n\nLike selfish voting is the stupidest human trait.\n\nIt's the one area where all Americans have the option to be as altruistic as humanly possible with the least amount of personal effort and we are simply not doing it because apparently if we make the world a better place that's not fair to those of us who had to grow up in a world that wasn't as good as it could have been.Boy, that sure sounds like some *activist judges* there. Didn't they also spend the last 30 years complaining about exactly that? \n\nHmmhttps://vic2.paradoxwikis.com/Ideology\n\n> Fascists are unique, in that they are the only party that can support both the implementation and the repeal of political reforms. This support by fascists in the upper house is dependent upon whether or not a fascist party is in power. If it is, they can implement or repeal political reforms, but if they are the opposition party, they will staunchly resist all changes.>and complaining that republicans haven't all come to a consensus on how many weeks after conception they should ban abortion from.\n\nThey've had how many *decades* now to figure this out? It's like the dog that finally caught the car...\"...keeps TVs on news all day, unfortunately they show Fox \"\n\nThat sounds awful.Ummm... they do. \nWho do you think funds the gqp?\"Whoops!\"\n\n*\"Whoopsie!\"*Oh, letting people live their lives without government interference in basic human rights is TIGHT.Ooh, making this country into a shitty place to live is *tight*!Wow. Wow. Wow wow wow.Oh but sir, have you considered\u2014 money?I'm gonna need you to get *all the way* off my back on thisUnorthodox, but I'll allow itYou're not required to sue all those who infringe, but if you let too many unauthorized uses, you're considered as having abandoned your IP. The problem is how many is \"too many\", so companies just chose to sue everyone.\n\nIn that specific case, Disney could have as well given them a formal authorization, but they didn't. An authorized use is no longer an infringement.\n\nIIRC, Warner told the daycare centers that they can use their characters instead.You say that as if a DeSantis supporter knows how to read.Hands down. There was zero discussion of changing the RCID until Disney offended the governor.Luckily term limits for FL governor are well defined in the Florida Constitution so it would be relatively difficult to change. Would require 60% approval by FL voters via ballot. So not impossible but unlikely.I am unsure of the migratory history of beavers or their predisposition to playing chess. But I do know all this talk of beavers is beginning to make me a bit uncomfortable.How many chess pieces can the Eurasian beaver possible carry?I can\u2019t wait for them to be like:\n\n \u201cSo, Mr DeSantis, what did you mean when you said the oversight board was retaliation for Disney\u2019s stance on gay rights? Follow up question, what\u2019s the first amendment again?\u201dHe Jeb'd himself real quick this yearIt\u2019s pretty funny too because a guy like DeSantis who\u2019s from Florida should know more than most people how powerful Disney is. And yet he stupidly tried to fuck with them anyway.This one isn't even a reference it's just true lmaoHe was in the Navy. He is all about an unshielded exhaust port.There's a lot to dislike about Churchill, but damn if he isn't quotable as hell.Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of!Is that a real quote? That's amazing if so lol\". . . humperdoo?\"Just started it. SO GOOD HOLY BEESWAXHe's only a florida native for another 2 years. Dude is term limited and doesn't give a wet shit about florida.I'm not necessarily pro-Disney, but I'm definitely anti-Desantis.Sunk cost fallacy. DeSantis put all his eggs in one basket on this, and if he doesn't win, his presidential aspirations are over. The problem is, if he flip flops now, he looks weak to his base, and might not even get to another term as Governor. He tripled down on stupid, and now he can't get out of it. I'm sure he would turn the clock backward and never start this squabble in the first place, given the option.I wasn't aware she could do that.At least in the Megacorp dystopian nightmare they won't legislate me going to church every Sunday.This is the kind of case conservative judges might actually apply the constitution to for a number of reasons;\n\n1. Protect monied donors ala mifepristone SCOTUS ruling\n2. Avoid the backlash in voting public. Nothing like an obviously corrupt judge to drive motivation to vote. \n3. Protect their own asses and careers from audit or review. Egregious rulings have a way of bringing down more scrutiny from press and legislative officialsIn this corner is Prime Mohammed Ali wearing a pair of mouse ears and in this corner is a Pi\u00f1ata shaped like a man. Let's get ready to RUMBLE.>Disney is presenting arguments closely aligned with republican beliefs (government overreach, corporations as people, etc). \n\nBold of you to assume the Republican base has actual values outside of anything they believe \"triggers the libs\"\n\nIdeological consistency isn't their strong suitIt was always projection.well what they really want is to ban it completely, they just learned after Kansas that they can't get away with that anymore. so I guess now they have to figure out how much bullshit people will tolerateWow wow wow, wow.See, about all the policies that specifically target vulnerable groups. I\u2019m gonna need you to get all the way off my back about those.Oh I didn't know this was about money, go on then.Oooh understanding an internet reference is *tight*Who doesn't like a hairy beaver?\"Corporations aren't people and don't get free speech!\"\n\nRon Desantis: secret weapon to try to get citizens united repealedI was thinking the same thing.  A lot to dislike about that guy but man did he know how to throw some *serious shade*The man really did have a knack for a great turn of phrase. Like almost every larger than life character in history, he had many flaws. But he was the right man at the right time for Britain.Yes. Churchhill was clever.Which is obvious to anyone that lives here and has managed, somehow, to retain their critical thinking abilities after years of the sun attempting to bake it out of them. \n\nThere are, at least in my area, very few of those people left. I wish that were surprising.I assume DeSantis is going to request that the Florida Legislature wipe away the Gov Term Limit, so DeSantis can basically be Emperor for Life? \n\nIt's going to be hard for him to run for President and explain why other companies and Mom-n-Pops don't need to fear for their very existence with his administration.They'll just make you tour through Smallworld ad infinitum.Many republican appointees on the bench were appointed before the days of \u201cowning the libs.\u201d Back when republicans just complained about taxes all day.\"We love corporations\" is another Republican value, though, and it's one that was here before DeSantis and will be here after DeSantis.  He's an idiot if he thinks anyone outside of Florida's going to bat for him.Wow Wow Wow Wow WowHarry Beaver? Good lad, not bad at chess either.A part of me wants that, mainly to see if the republicans side with him, or drop his ass. It'll be very interesting that's for sure!If DeSantis accidentally gets citizens united repealed it\u2019ll be the best thing that giant fucking hypocrite has and will ever do.Lady Astor: \"Mr. Churchill, if you were my husband, I would poison your coffee!\"\n\nChurchill: \"If I were your husband, I would drink it.\"We're out there, it's just hard to hear us over the mouth breathers. Stay safeI voted all Democrat for the first time ever just due to DeSantis big Fascist mouth. \n\nEven if the \"Democrat\" was another republican, like the governor race lol. \n\nI really don't like voting down party lines, but DeSantis forced my hand. Theres a lot of us non conservative nuts in Florida it's just most don't vote.Because most are old, deeply fear change and those young kids (anyone under 50)and also don't give a  wet sh*t about florida.\n\nFlorida used to be deeply democratic and life was pretty good for the common man. AC was invented, the old timer fox New lovers started streaming in the state. The fascist saw their chance and took over in 1996 and its been down hill sincePanhandle here\u2026. \n\nThe brain dead people firmly sewing themselves ass to mouth, feeding human centipede style on DeSantis\u2019 culture war shit, are everywhere.  \n\nPeople are stroking him off almost as much as Trump.This case is going to cost the Floridian taxpayer dearly and might even bankrupt the state, and over half the jobs here are at risk of being lost if this goes sideways. \n\nAs a lifelong Floridian, that\u2019s really gonna suck. But then again\u2026\nDesantis is a fascist. He ruined my state already. He and his mafia have sucked everything this state had dry of resources, they grift and steal and refuse to acknowledge as lost jobs and climate change and brain drain and dying infrastructure come knocking at every one of our doors. I\u2019ll gladly pay for him to lose. \n\nDisney. Bleed him dry.He doesn't want to be governor for life, he wouldn't answer his opponent in debate when asked if he would serve his full term as governor or leave early to go run for president.  He's repulsive and I hope the mouse beats the teacups off him.Fuck Dagoth Ur's nonsense, Smallworld is the *real* Poison SongThat's from that THING!",

If Disney had the contract written properly (and given the reputation of Disney's lawyers, I'm betting that they did), then the new board can't just unilaterally rip up the contract because they don't like it.DeSantis should have objected during the public hearings on the matter. He didn\u2019t. He was too distracted by puddin\u2019 and drag queens.My family voted last night to declare our mortgage void. It was signed into effect at the 11th hour right before we moved in. We own the house free and clear now.See you in court. The lawyers must be so excited. \u201cHoney, we\u2019re getting a new mansion!\u201d>The lawsuit was filed in federal court minutes after the board appointed by DeSantis to oversee Disney\u2019s special taxing district sought to claw back its power from the entertainment giant, voting to invalidate an agreement struck between Disney and the previous board in February, just before that board\u2019s dissolution.\n\n>\u201cWhat they created is an absolute legal mess, OK?

I\u2019m rooting for you!And then Disney sued....Getting all text messages and emails between desantis amd all his henchmen will be such a fun time for disney.lolAll 6 current justices of the state Supreme Court were appointed by Republican governors, 4 by DeSantis, and there's one open seat that DeSantis will fill.Florida's brand of fascism.Yeah that's not how contracts work but you guys do you boo. They big mad? I would ask if the board has no power. Why are you guys paying these people?This is correct.  The state cannot just invalid contracts it signs.On top of this, Disney's legal team are some of the best and most experienced in the world. They know how contracts and the laws work and will get a victory out of this thus taking DeSantis down a peg.Ohh I\u2019ve been meaning to put my mortgage to a vote, I\u2019ll pencil it in for tonight after dinner.Technically your mortgage is void, the banks never put any money down or loaned you the money. \n\nGoogle First National Bank of Montgomery v. DalyThis just happend halawsuit was filed in federal court.  Two judges were Trump appointees, one from Obama, and one from Bush 2.  The senior judges were appointed by Ford, Bush 1, and Clinton.  Will be interesting to see who draws this one.There is a reason they are lifetime appointments.  Their seats are secure, shielded from state politics.  They can tell DeSantis to pound sand and there is nothing he can do about it.Lol that's where you are wrong. This is Ron DeSantis and the GOP. In the words of the LA Rams GM: F#ck them laws.Is that the case that multiple courts have notes is invalidated on appeal, and creates no precedent.Yeah, [the post right after this one when I sort the sub by new](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12zmsi4/disney_sues_florida_gov_ron_desantis_alleges)Cool, thank you for the better context. \n\nIt's amazing that judges appointed by Ford are still working.The Justices have assigned [Circuits](https://spremecourt.gov/about/circuitassignments.aspx) that they cover, the 11th Circuit (AL, FL, GA) is Thomas's so not looking great.Except if they do, their GOP donor friends won\u2019t pay for their vacations or agree to buy inflated real estate anymore, so there\u2019s thatIf this holds than contract law and doing business with the state goes completely into chaos\n\nWe are getting to \u201cI am altering the deal.

He\u2019s more like a spastic squirrel.My theory is of course he doesn't want to be challenged, but in one court appearance, I think the Criminal one in Manhattan, his lawyers cited that Trump couldn't appear in court for one hearing date because of a potential debate, and Judge said \"ha ha, no\" in essence.  \n\nSo I think Trump is going to avoid debates because in criminal court, it is mandatory he appear.  It would be easier to say \"I didn't want to do it anyway\" than have to bow out because he has a mandatory court appearance.Pretty sure he's really outraged that anyone should be allowed to even run against him.\"Will you shut up, man!\"  - Biden to Trump in their debate.He is unable to debate, and everyone knows it now. If he's dumb enough to participate, he will be eviscerated. People are already salivating at the possibility of going up against him on live television, now that they understand his childish bag of tricks.This is what that party embraced years ago.  They aided the monster.  They were warned he was a monster.  Now it\u2019s coming back to bite them, and I\u2019m all for it.>hostile Networks with angry, TRUMP & MAGA hating anchors asking the \u2018questions,\u2019 why subject yourself to being libeled and abused?\n\nFox News is a hostile network now? Is that because Tucker won't be there cradling his balls while he spews hateful rhetoric?I think his political opponents should simply hire an eleven year old internet troll to face him in debates.Gotta say, I am absolutely loving watching an increasingly unelectable Donald Trump turn the GOP into his own personal power fantasy by holding the entire Party hostage.Let's be real. He was never going to debate.The media did it for him on 2016.It's my party and I'll cry if I want to.His party wishes he would go away but they\u2019re too cowardly to say it.Frankenstein\u2019s monster.  The GOP created this creature now they have to live with it. If it wasn\u2019t so horrifying it\u2019d be fun to watch.He doesn't want to sign a paper saying he'll support desantis if he wins. That's it. That's the whole reason.Rubio, Trump & Cruz; The Shitheads ThreeIf words are not on a teleprompter, his brain  literally short-circuits.Eyyy they\u2019re following Democratic party steps!Big city grifter hoodwinks morons...a tale as old as timeTrump just wants the nomination. He\u2019s gotta be even extra mad that Dems are all lining up and supporting Biden and they won\u2019t have any debates. He expects the same and doesn\u2019t like looking weaker than the guy who defeated him.He isn't preparing, it's done.\n\nAnything less than a coronation by the gop will be perceived as disloyalty and punished.They should just a picture on Trump at his podium during the debate.Entitled con man is throwing a tantrump (heh) because feels he should just be handed the nomination.DJT doesn't want a debate.  He's weak at debating.  He wants fiat power.Awesome i hop he sinks the GOPTrump simply trying to flex, him shouting petty slander at intimidated politicians and its coverage is a significant reason he won the primary and election.He's such an incompetent little pissant.He will try hard not to have to bring a forklift onto the debate stage with all that baggage of his, that it would have to carryHow do we convince him to run 3rd party. It would be the best thing for America.\n\nMake him believe it will save his skin? (I mean if it worked and he won power it likely would save his skin)BiglyYou don't have to be able to hear him to know that's true.Didn\u2019t you hear? The GOP platform in 2020 was literally whatever trump says. No platform, just what he says. So he\u2019s never wrong. \n\nImagine your own party can\u2019t even expect you to stay on message or consistent with what you believe so they just say YOLO.Yesif trump says something and nobody fact checks it, can it be wrong?Hey!  I *like* squirrels!He's more like a toddler. Sounds come out of whichever orifice and someone else changes his diaper or sets up his toys.I think you have correct answer.Something something clownI really wish Disney's presidential robots would have Trump rambling about something crazy, only to have Biden interject with the above quote.Trump doesn't \"debate\" at all; he just talks like he's taping a pro wrestling promo. And this is how he came out ahead of the pack in 2016 - when your base identifies more strongly with pro wrestling than politics, they don't want to see a bunch of guys in ties following the rules; they want to see an old guy in diapers talking trash about his opponents in the simplest terms and with as much vitriol as possible, refusing to take any of it seriously.The issue is that anyone on the right who debates him either has to ignore his childish debate rhetoric, or go down to his level. Neither is a good strategy.But none of his voters care when he flails in debates, they already showed in two elections that's not only not relevant to why they're voting for him but in fact proving he is as inept as they are ingratiates him too them.Hopefully it all comes crashing to the groundI'm sure the teleprompter has the little bouncing ball to follow the words and all words are spelled like they sound as not to confuse him. There are probably little pictures over the tough words.I think \u201cwrong\u201d is the default.Gish gallops. Spouts so much nonsense opponent has no time to refute it and already off by having to disprove nonsense. Same as his daily rants/embarrassments as by time opponents talk about one already committed 10 more.\n\nThe Gish gallop is a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm their opponent by providing an excessive number of arguments with no regard for the accuracy or strength of those arguments.His base also falls for every con trick. \u201cAs you know\u201d followed with whatever bullshit he wants to lie about. Then his base is like yeah, I am smart. I do know that. Even though it\u2019s utter bullshit.We saw him with Biden. I can't imagine him being polite to Nicki Hailey....or, they could simply refute the childish rhetoric with straightfaced, facts delivered in condescending parental tones. \n\nExample: DJT: \"huge numbers voted for me, the biggest numbers ever!\" Other Guy: '88 million voted for Biden, Don. 88. Only 80 voted for you, and everyone learned in grade school that 80 is less than 88.\"\n\nJust pull a Psaki smackdown on him, he'll blow a gasket.Phonics 101 /sThe problem is the base doesn't really care about facts or correcting them. They'll just dismiss it as they believe the election was stolen.Republicans don\u2019t vote on facts or thought. They vote on feelings.\n\nFeels > realsRepublicans voters will be turned off by any candidate who appears to question their civic religion.The conservative voting base has been conditioned to believe, by FOX News, that what they believe is the truth and that facts are lies spread by the liberal MSM. 70% of GOP voters support Trump, a man who tried to overturn an election.",

It\u2019s just the way I roll \ud83c\udf31Note, this is slightly outdated now. It mentions that Minnesota has a vote on legalization soon, but it happened yesterday \n[Link](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-house-passes-recreational-marijuana-bill/)\n\nTLDR: Minnesota passed the bill to legalize recreational marijuanaCanada.> Some strains of the cannabis plant \u2013 often called marijuana or weed \u2013 contain a psychoactive compound called THC that produces a \"high\" when ingested.\n\nI love how most articles about cannabis these days usually have this kind of explanation for the squares.Hawaii is the only State that gets a pass when I'm deciding where to vacation. Otherwise, I'm sticking with states that don't have their heads up their ass like Florida and Texas.Why does this article read like it was written a decade ago?The MN house passed the bill.  Now the Senate needs to pass theirs. Then reconciliation votes by both again.  Then it can finically get signed by Walz.  \n\nIn my opinion, it is likely to become legalized in MN soon, but it still has a few hurdles to cross.Is cannabis recreationally legal throughout the entire country? I thought it was more of a province by province thing.Your northern neighbour has recreational cannabis federally, and your dollar has more purchasing power in exchange.\n\nObviously wait for summer, but check out Canada.Florida and Texas don\u2019t have their heads up their ass? Is that the idea you are trying to imply here?Legal federally and managed at the provincial level.I love Canada and I work with an awesome Canadian dude every day. I'm about 8-9 hours from Vancouver BC and the wife and I are planning a trip soon. I live in Oregon so legal weed here is no problem but I'd go to Canada just for the poutine and great people.Pedantic AND snarky? This is how you Reddit.Medically or recreationally or both?Quebec and the entire east coast are worth checking out.Both.Nice! Fortunately, for me, your wonderful country is only a half hour drive away, and I won\u2019t have to worry when I travel because I\u2019ll be able to buy locally!\n\nAs opposed to fucking Singapore, where they will hang you by your neck until you are dead.They just snapped somebody's neck yesterday for weed, though you probably already know that.",

It\u2019s like Stormy Daniels and Michael Avanetti.

    "Comments": "Republicans raised or modified the debt ceiling under Republican leadership **49 times** since 1960 with no strings attached.\n\nThe deficit grew $7 Trillion under the Trump administration, and Republicans voted to raise it 3 times in 4 years. Democrats did not threaten a default over it.\n\nThis is a completely fabricated issue and a hostage situation of America's full faith and credit. Full stop.Jim McGovern (D-MA) is going OFF:\n\n\"What's next, you want our first born children in exchange for paying the bills on time?\"\n\nThere's more like that.  Will link time-stamped clip [here](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5068067/user-clip-rep-mcgovern-debt-ceiling) when he's done talking.\n\nEdit: clip is linked above.  I created a C-SPAN account for y'all, hope you're happy.This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous and will likely blow up in Republicans faces.\n\nThey raised the debt ceiling with no strings attached three fucking times during the Trump administration, but now suddenly that the president is a democratic they can't do that and instead want to hold everyone hostage and risk a massive economic recession.\n\nNow some of them are probably thinking hey, if we tank the economy under Biden's watch, we may have a chance in 2024 but historically that is categorically false.\n\nin 1996 Republicans threatened to breach the debt limit.  They were bluffing and Clinton called their bluff.  Then that same year he won reelection with an insane 379 electoral votes.\n\nIn 2011 Republicans again held the debt ceiling hostage.  Just two days before shit hit the fan an agreement was reached but due to the delays stocks plummeted with more force than they had since the 2008 crisis.  On top of this America's credit rating was downgraded for the first time in history.  What happened in 2012?  Obama won reelection with 332 electoral votes.\n\nTime and time again the American public at large realizes that this tactic is basically Republican's throwing a hissy fit to get their way and sacrificing the well being of the entire nation for their own benefit.  McCarthy is just the most recent asshole to try this tactic that will hopefully blow up in their face once again.  If Biden is smart he stays the course, doesn't compromise to these tactics, and does everything within his executive authority to stave off a crisis while being loud and clear about the hypocrisy of the right.\n\nGranted these days with the rise of social media people are stupider and more likely to form groups that will not see the plain idiocy on display, so my hope is that if the right truly wants to plunge us off the cliff or pass a bill that hemorrhages major social programs Biden instead mints the coin or uses obscure executive language to mitigate the risk.  From there he could easily say to the public \"The right was willing to plunge us into economic failure and the only out they gave would have hurt veterans, those on social security, etc but I saved us all and if you don't vote for me in 2024 all that is fucked.\"They want to put work requirements on qualifying for Medicaid.\n\nSo when someone gets so sick they can't work, they lose their health insurance. What a terrible position to be putting people in. Par for the course with this GOP - the cruelty is the point.\n\nAmerica just goes deeper and deeper into the circles of hell.Why is it always cuts to social safety nets and never rolling back overly generous tax cuts for the already wealthy? And all those MAGA  types that clamor for Making America Great Again go back to the 90% corporate tax rate that was in effect then?Republicans hold the majority and still managed to act like the fucking victims. Unconsciousble.What discussion, just raise itReminder: McCarthy had months to negotiate a deal with Jefferies.The sound of Kevin McCarthy's voice is fucking torture. Especially because he talks about helping the American people, and it's all bullshit. I'm so sick of the GOP. They are a disgrace.I don't know why this is such big news.  Biden already said no negotiations on this.  If it's not raising the debt ceiling alone it's a waste of time.  They are spending so much time and effort to write out garbage that won't go anywhere.  \"Look we wrote this as a compromise for you Biden!\". No, the compromise is passing the debt ceiling raise without anything else, that's the compromise.McGovern is back, now asking to insert into the congressional record a document he alleges will show detail how the GOP budget cuts would, among other things, allow X amount of fentanyl into the country and cause Y amount of additional maternal mortality.  He's going fast.Realize that McCarthy is using all this capital to pass a bill that is DOA in the Senate.\n\nHe created this problem by trying to use the debt ceiling bill as a hostage.  Realize that Biden has no choice here because he knows if McCarthy is successful, the Republicans will circle back again to this in 2024And whatever get passed will be stripped from the senate bill and sent back as a clean debt limit bill, like how it should be.Rep Tom Cole (R-OK) now saying that the GOP will not sign onto a 'clean' debt ceiling bill.  'Not going to give you what you can't get yourself.'\n\nClaiming GOP cares about the poorest of the poor with respect to opposition to inflation, the \"cruelest tax of all\".Democrats need to come out with some great ads that tell Americans what exactly is going on with the debt ceiling. \n\nOne that explains in ordinary terms what Republicans are pulling with this, risking the credit rating of the US, which can have dire consequences.\n\nA few others detailing specifically what McCarthy is proposing to cut.\n\nPoint out the hypocrisy and incompetency on the GOP side, like there\u2019s never any issue with the debt ceiling when Republicans have the Presidency.I'd just like to say that by this point in a presidency, trump was at the golf course \\~33% of the time. You don't see Sleepy Joe taking days off. Who's **really** working hard for America?The Republican Party says that government doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAnd they do everything in their power to prove that point by making sure that the government cannot work.\"So here we are, debating this bill, the \"Default on America Act\".\n\n...\n\n\"They handed us a ransom note.\"\n\n\\-McGovern\n\nEdit: C-SPAN is choosing to replay McGovern's takedown from earlier while the current preliminary vote rolls in.Biden just needs to direct the treasury to ignore this dumbass authorization from today forward.  It is nothing but a political game.  Just stop this shit before it even gets started.  Once a budget is passed, that is what will be paid.  No more extra steps giving dipshits a way to hold Americans hostage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome out in prime time TV and explain how he is going to save Americans from Republicans extremism.  How he is making this decision because he dares not let Republicans jeopardize Americans financial well being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat would also strengthen the American and global economy because lenders and creditors see that America is no longer playing games with a default.  The U.S. pays its bills no matter which political party is in charge.GOP:   Gimme, gimme, gimme.   And cuts on everything else.  Either that or we threaten to wipe out US economy on default.   Take that Biden, huh.\n\nRight Repubs?Mike Bost is so full of poop his suit is brown.\n\nedit: yup he's a real class act\n\n>In 1986, his daughter required stitches after being bitten by a beagle after antagonizing and chasing it. Unsatisfied with authorities' lack of an immediate response, Bost drove to the dog's owner's home and shot the dog dead with a handgun while it was in its enclosure. He was arrested and charged with criminal damage to property and reckless misconduct in relation to the incident, but was acquitted at trial.[77][78] In 2014, Bost joked to a reporter about the killing.[79]\n\n>In 2006, authorities confronted Bost after he failed to report that his gun was stolen after it was used to threaten another man's life. He led authorities to his gun safe, which contained a bottle of whiskey and no gun.[77][78]I wish there was some sort of punishment for telling blatant lies when running the country.I love Republican ideas and explanations......\"Here's all the things we propose that will harm Americans and why it's really Democrats fault not ours.\"I see a lot of people down below talking about \"eventually there will be negotiations.. agreements will be made\".  Just stop.. there is no negotiating here.  Negotiation is when the budget gets passed.  Not on authorizing paying the previous agreed on budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no negotiation on this.  Either McCarthy sends a clean bill or they choose to default.  Stop giving them air time with any \"negotiation\" talk because it isn't going to happen.I hope Biden holds an Oval Office address at 8pm, to rip their shitty bill in half and publicly shame them into sending a clean bill. No negotiations with terroristsHow about controlling the out-of-control record profits? Fucking asshatHoney, I'll pay the house payment, but only if you stop feeding the twins.Is that how this works? Because as a veteran... They're cutting veterans and using this angry veteran as a pawn.Obviously dead on arrival and Republicans are already saying it's Dems fault if Republicans punt the economy off a cliff like they are doing.It won't go anywhere in the Senate, thank God.  They keep making it worse, not better with each amendment.The Constitution says this shouldn't be a debate. Why are we doing this?Biden can and should instruct the Treasury to disregard the debt ceiling and continue on as usual. Default is unconstitutional.It won\u2019t be a debate. It will be a hostage negotiation in which we should ignore completely.Hopefully Biden and Chuck learned their lessons from 2011 when democrats caved. \n\nRepublicans are not negotiating in good faith and this whole thing is so stupid. Let it blow up in their facesi hate how republicans say that \"it will save tax payers money\" im like, YOU STILL GONNA PAY THE SAME AMOUNT OF TAX!!! THEY ARE LYING!!!! AND THEN MY REPUBLICAN COWORKERS HELL YEAH!!! LOOKING OUT FOR US!!! sigh ....No strings on debt limit theatrics when their guy was in office. Fair is fair. Glad you got your participation trophy McCarthy.Guys y\u2019all need to be watching the hearing on the atf. Shit is fucking HILARIOUS. Biggs is out of his MIND.GOP proposal: \u201cFuck you, that\u2019s why.\u201d40 minutes of gaetz?\n\nPlease no...C-SPAN caller: Hunter Biden letter was first drafted by Antony Blinken (our current Secretary of State).\n\nFirst, lol.\n\nSecond, please change, C-SPAN callers.  You're freaking out the WSJ journalist on the panel.Since it's likely scrawled in crayon and full of spelling errors I'm pretty sure it's DOA and a massive waste of time.How many GOP holdouts cause a failure?\n\n6?How many countries other than the US have something like debt ceiling? My guess is <5 out 200+.House is back on the stream.\n\nEdit: House holding a roll call vote on whether to move to debate on two bills, one of which is the debt ceiling / spending cut bill.  The other is related to solar imports.Is it time for Kevin's Scheduled Public Humiliation to help fulfill his degradation kink already?Doesn\u2019t it severely threaten the strength of the dollar and the attractiveness of America as an investment opportunity if we default on our debt? Why is this a problem for most of my adult life? It seems like the kind of thing a child could understand.This is some rich bullshit Kevin McCarthy is shilling.  Republicans care about the deficit as much as Sarah Huckabee Sanders cares about her fashion choices.It passed............\n\n.......and, it's dead!\n\nGood job Republicans, really great use of your time.Why won't you let us shoot a few hostages? - RepublicansIt's a little sad that this game of chicken must be played over and over again. Don't these school yard kids ever want to play a new game? Oh wait, these are supposedly our leaders, not playground children!https://twitter.com/micasoellnerdc/status/1651289819618607119\n\n>BURCHETT is still a \u201cno\u201d on the debt limit walking out of votes today. He says there\u2019s about half a dozen members who are on the same page as him. (AKA too many)It will be interesting because the GOP doesn't seem to have any grasp of reality or technical things or reason.We're currently in the \"General Speeches - One Minute\" phase of the House session.  Representatives are standing mostly to recognize veterans from their districts.\n\nExcept for Rep. Spanberger, who is I believe the first person to use their one minute speech to oppose an element of the debt ceiling / budget bill, specifically cutting Meals on Wheels.  Telling stories of people from throughout her district (VA-7) and the program's impact on them.https://twitter.com/LisaDNews/status/1651284116896206853?s=20\n\n>ANNND exiting \n@SpeakerMcCarthy\n\u2019s office, \n@RepNancyMace\n tells us she is now a yes.\n\n>Says she felt heard by the Speaker on her concerns over wind/solar credits being cut and also push for a balanced budget.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chadpergram/status/1651280972267110423\n\n>From colleague Tyler Olson. Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) just told reporters she's undecided on the debt limit bill and walked into Speaker McCarthy's office.House session Part 2 set to go live in about 20 minutes.  Can be watched at a different C-SPAN link than the one in the post above:\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?527649-3/house-session-part-2So what does the passing of the Bill mean in real terms for ordinary Americans?When does the Senate vote on the bill?Just had to post this bonkers excerpt:\n\n>In a private meeting in the Capitol, GOP leaders debated how high of a debt limit increase they should seek. Some had floated **odd numbers because it sounded more intentional than an even number. One member suggested $1.69 trillion, but that was rejected because of the innuendos associated with such a figure**, according to three GOP sources. Ultimately, a $1. 5 trillion increase was the number they settled on.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/mccarthy-republicans-debt-ceiling-vote/index.htmlIf only democrats did 1% better in November..or focused more attention in NY and CA.. Unreal incompetence in New York gave us the republican majority in the house.I remember when the parties didn\u2019t do symbolic votes and actually figured out how to get things passed. \n\nThis is sad. Super fucking sad.I am almost speechless over this, especially the work requirements. Most of the able bodied recipients who can work are working already and only receive benefits because employers with the same values as the GOP won\u2019t pay a living wage.\n\nNext most infuriating  are proposed cuts to every incentive and investment the Democrats have passed in the last couple of years, which will starve the GDP, innovation and growth.Looks like they probably have the votes. Which sucks, because it'd be great to have this be a non-starter. Watch for them try to blame upcoming possible default to Biden, but it's all them.  Time to negotiate this stuff was when you have to work out a budget, not holding America hostage.The GOP is full in \"do this for our kids\" mode. What transparent bullshit.Ok, so whos gonna dig thru this bill and see how many tax cuts for the rich there are?I have no faith in GOP version of Debt Limit Billthe \"debate\" is if it screws over the poor and working class enough.I came on to this late and it immediately went to recess- anything substantive happen yet?We will see if the Republicans will get enough votes to pass this first version of the bill.\n\nI don't think all the Republicans will vote to pass this first version of raising the debt ceiling, we will see if there is enough votes to even pass the bill, they don't need all the Republicans, 4 can vote note, or not vote.\n\nEssentially the House Republicans only need 5 votes to stop the debt ceiling from being raised ever, if an agreement with House Democrats cannot be reached.\n\nDepending on agreement or not, there will need to be \\~10 Senators Republicans or Democrats to jump the aisle and vote for raising the debt ceiling.\n\nAfter the vote for the speaker, I kinda think there are 5 House Republicans that will never vote to actually raise the debt ceiling.How does this end? Asking literally. Are we basically headed toward default?There is no debt limit bill or debates.  Either Republicans decide to default on our loans or they don't.  There will be no negotiations with economic terrorists.This whole debt ceiling/social programs/culture war shit has been god damn exhausting and it's nowhere near done. In less than a year we'll be in the beginning stages of presidential ad buys and rallies for primaries and caucuses, and then it's another election with whatever lies and hate that can be conjured being fair game, followed by another several months of fighting the results. \n\nIt feels like I'm on the playground watching a fight happen and there's no adult around to help.I know it's the thing that beltway makes fun of...but I'm of the \"Mint the Coin\" mindset. \n\nIf I recall the 2 negatives when discussed:\n1) constitutionally untested\n2) political liability - appears authoritarian/overreach of the executive branch\n\nBy minting \"the coin\" we start the constitutional test - what does that look like as far as the courts possibly being too late to intervene? Like sorry courts we already paid the bills...\n\nI don't think too many Dems would be upset by this. Magas would lose their shit but thats a constant state of being for them. Don't know how it would play to the I's. \n\nAnd I think I'm living in la la land, but dunno how this shakes otherwise.C-SPAN stream is up!\n\nHouse Chaplain is opening with a prayer.Gotta yield 3 people back so we can read a statement from our sponsors.Montana state house is going to take punitive action against democrat Zooey Zephyr for protesting because they wouldn't let her speak. It should start anytime around now, though I don't know how late in the day they will wait for it https://leg.mt.gov/audio-video/Tell the trump Nazi Party to go Fk themselves.\nLet them shut down the government and see how it works out for them next election cycle.So are we headed towards a default now? I don't see a clean spending bill passing the House, the only 4 republicans who voted against this bill did so because it didn't cut spending enough.EDIT: House of RussiansRaise the debt ceiling. In return, you get nothing. No compromise. This charade is taxingThe Korean president was with the president today. He had an interpreter to help each understand each other. I wish the Republicans had one to tell the American people what their actual motives are. They want to pull back on saving the environment. Threaten the world economy just because it is a Democratic President and kiss Trump\u2019s behind. I just got off the phone yelling at my reps office person to defy McCarthy even though will do no good.I still don't get how they start these things off with a prayer.DOA bill.This guy looks like he used Just For Men to paint his beard onI swear that's Jason Lee in a fat suit playing a character like Tom Cruise in Tropical Thunder.\n\nAlso jason smith likes puppy mills. Man it's always something with these guys.What vote or motion are they currently working on?\n\nEdit: it looks like at 5:38 (lol) ET  they started the actual vote.\n\nAt 5:41 I see 4 GOP nos.the bill passed, these pathetic bastardsSedition Kevin dancing for the kremlin. Here\u2019s hoping the democrats don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists.The logical solution is to tax the rich and negotiate lower prices for government purchases. Republicans give huge tax cuts to the wealthy because the wealthy are the major donors to Republican candidates. If they ever agreed to take that away they'd never get elected. So Kevin McCarthy has to embarrass himself with a proposal even his own caucus won't support in the end.McCarthy's justification for raising the debt ceiling 3 times during the trump administration was that Republicans made \"economic changes\" that justified raising debt ceiling.\n\nWhat were those economic changes? He was never asked what those economic  changes were.  Why wasn't there pushback by the interviewer?Weak sauce democrats shouldn't even entertain the idea of bowing down to the republicans' demands. Call their bluff. Are they really going to allow the world economy to crash? Not while their donors are watching. Don't make me laugh.This debate is nothing. The debt ceiling matters but nothing will change today.\"Every voter will suffer tremendously if the US defaults on his debt, including every Republican.  How can you consider that to be \"leverage\" in your favor?\"   \n\n\nDoes anyone ever ask this ?  I know they will hem and haw and bullshit hte answer, but really that's all it boils down to.  Ask this over and over every time McFuckFace shows his stupid face.Honestly though ...why would a Democratic congress ever raise the debt ceiling again under a Republican president in the future. If this is how Republicans are going to act.  \nF them and let a Republican eat the shit. Just say raise the taxes on the wealthy or it is going to default. That is what the next Democratic congress should say to a Republican president.If this passes, the economy would still go to shit, but vulnerable people would bear the brunt.\n\nIf we default, the economy will go to shit, vulnerable people would bear the brunt, but also rich people would feel the pain of their bond holdings becoming less valuable.\n\nIt\u2019s a sham. Republicans aren\u2019t going to let that happen. Don\u2019t blink, Mr. Biden.Tom Cole (R-OK) argued earlier that the welfare work requirements the GOP is proposing now are less stringent than the ones that Biden supported in the '90s.What is Arrington basing his claims on? Lowest poverty in years? Unprecedented growth? According to who, his donors?Any idea why the Dems didn't deal with this when they had both houses of Congress?  Manchin?~~Who are the two Democrats that apparently decided not to vote?~~\n\nNvm my comment.You really have zero idea how economy works..... can't run out of money lmaoTo all you members that are out here this place is just full of censors\nI feel like I can't even say anything or speak my mind in text without being censored\nI don't know who made these rules up must have been a bunch of Christians or religious people that can't handle it and I will not join or be part of this I was joined for a few minutes till I read the rules I already know I'm going to get banned anyway and I'll probably be banned for this and I don't give a f***[deleted][removed]How about you really smart democrats explain what happens when we run out of money?  I wish I could run my household with a trillion dollar debt instead of a surplus.[removed]It's irresponsible to keep such reckless amount of spending without any concern about how it will affect future generations. Last year we spent $475 billion on interest payments alone and this number only goes up every year. \n\nWe need to balance the budget or the US is headed towards an inevitable default. This bill is pretty weak, it doesn't even touch Pentagon spending but it's still a step in the right directionThe chorus and fury of 220 Debt Ceiling Fans ...and this is why I want to move to another country so I can watch it all burn from a safe distanceIt's faux outrage for political posturing. Watch as an \"agreement\" happens at the 11th hour and it gets raised.\n\nCapital rules US politics and capital will never allow a default that would destroy the global economy.That's why what Biden is doing is so important. He refuses to entertain this bullshit as a valid, good faith debate. He knows the history, and he knows the Dems can point to that history to win in the court of public opinion. More importantly, he knows how dangerous these tactics are and how important it is to force the GOP to give them up. \n\nThis is a time for precedents. This is an important line in the sand, and he's right to have drawn it. The GOP is trying to tank the economy by either forcing a default or getting a bill passed that is designed to destroy the economy. Their entire goal is to artificially cause a recession so they can blame Biden. They have to be stopped, or at minimum they need to have the blame hung around their necks and raked over the coals for their treachery.Given we all knew this would happen, just like in 2011... why didn't Democrats do away with the debt ceiling when they had control?\n\nBills were introduced in both chambers in 2021, but went nowhere. Biden even said he was against abolishing the debt ceiling. So, here we are... about to begin negotiations to cut Democratic programs, just like in 2011.\n\nThe lack of Democratic action is telling: party leadership actually wants spending cuts, to mollify its wealthy donors. There's no other explanation for why they didn't act on this when they had the chanceClaiming \"the deficit grew $7 trillion under the Trump administration\" is such a dishonest statement and everyone repeating it should know better.\n\nWhile Trump did not reduce the deficit and his terrible tax plan increased the deficit by $2 trillion over 10 years, the deficit primarily exploded as a result of COVID. The reason it exploded was due to the aid and measures passed by Congress, where the House was under Democrat control since Jan 2018.\n\nTo say Trump is solely responsible for that is so blatantly inaccurate, especially considering no bill would have made it to his desk in the later two years of his presidency (when the deficit grew the most) without the Democrats authorizing the spending.McGovern: \"Listen to President Trump, he's the one you're all afraid of.\"Glad that we have elected representatives who are sick of this bullshit.Hmm McGovern tell us how you really feel. \n\nGloves off right from the start.The only two words being uttered in response:\n\nWithout Objection.Thanks for sharing that. He nails it the whole way around.Thanks for this!Also, Biden has decades of experience in Congress and knows it inside and out. I'm betting he'll call the Republicans out on their bluff and can work to frame it in a way where if the economy tanks due to a default he says \"Well gee guys, this wouldn't have happened if the Republicans had voted to raise the debt ceiling like they did while Trump was in office with no issues whatsoever.\">...and will likely blow up in Republicans faces.\n\nCitation needed.\n\nSeriously: Someone, ANYONE please show me these consequences that they all say will be arriving any day now. Please? Pretty please?And the tradeoff for this is that the debt limit is raised for 10 months. It's not even \"give us these concessions and we never need to discuss the debt limit again.\" It's \"give us all these concessions and then in under a year we'll be back demanding even more concessions or we'll crash the world economy.\"Of course, putting work requirements on Medicaid subsidizes the billionaire class. \n\nIt encourages employers to reduce healthcare benefits, and shove those costs onto the taxpayer.My girlfriend is currently jobless because she knows holding down a job is near-impossible for her until she gets on proper medication.\n\nWe've gotten her on Medicaid and have appointments lined up to talk about prescriptions. This would be devastating if it somehow passes.> Why is it always cuts to social safety nets and never rolling back overly generous tax cuts for the already wealthy?\n\nbecause republicans do not give a flying fuck about anyone other than themselves.Or cut the defense spending- we've pulled out of Afghanistan, but somehow the budget continues to increase year over year despite 5+ years of failed Pentagon audits.They didn\u2019t put all the effort into this culture war on trans people for no good reason, that culture war exists to distract people from how the GOP it\u2019s screwing their own voters overThe first part happens because of the second part.\n\nThe ultra wealthy contribute to politicians. In return those politicians lower their taxes (and spin it to the rest of us a \u201ctax cut\u201d so regular people thing they\u2019re getting tax cuts too\u201d.\n\nThen they go ans slash social safety nets because, guess what, the less that needs to go to the programs, the less the rich need to pay, even more, into taxes.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the rich getting richer and using propaganda to pit the rest of us against each other.Not a word- unconscionable is what you mean*ducks*>Unconsciousble\n\nThat's literally their platform.Nah republicans want to cut veterans benefits social security Medicaid etc etc etcTell that to the republicans. They\u2019re the hostage takersThey won't negotiate in good faith. That's evident by the quality of the bill they're proposing. They're fucking delusional in telling themselves what they're proposing is going to help the common American.That sharp intake of breath he takes when he thinks he made a good point is torturous. You can tell he thinks he's a good speaker.It likely won't even pass the Senate. They'll send it back as a clean bill.It's theater for their base.  They've given up on courting new voters and the only solution is to lock the base in for the rest of their lives and hope voter suppression and outright fascism is enough to keep their territory red and electing RepublicansAssuming Biden stands firm.Mint the coin.Manchin and Sinema will make sure a clean bill doesn't make it through the Senate. I'm starting to think it's more likely than not we find out just how fast and how far our economy can crumble.Translation: We're going to cause the default, but we'll blame you anyways.May I ask for a clarification? \n\nAre you saying Democrats should come out with a TRUTHFULL ad explaining what is happening? Why the debt ceiling is in jeopardy? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for a truthful answer and vote.Conservative voters are firmly post-truth.Fun Fact: The acronym for \"Default on America\" is DOA, commonly used to describe legislation sent to the Senate, that will never be passed by that body. Or in other words: \"Dead on Arrival\".\"you, Congress, have already authorized this spending, and it has already happened. Constitutionally, the us is required to pay it's debts. Therefore, I am paying the bills. If you wish  to negotiate on future spending or revenue,that is of course your job.\"I love this!Thats not a possibility without a constitutional amendment. Even if the executive wanted to only the House has the power to actually do it.\n\n\u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.\u201d\n\u2014 U.S. Constitution, Article I, section 7, clause 1\n\n\u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.\u201d\n\u2014 U.S. Constitution, Article I, section 9, clause 7It should be not being re-elected. But to many ignore the blatant lie.> Negotiation is when the budget gets passed. Not on authorizing paying the previous agreed on budget.\n\nThis is what i keep screaming. Why are we having this fight. we already agreed on a fucking budget.Good. I hope he points out how the GOP is making paying out bills political, and only wants to cut programs they don\u2019t like.Except the American population looks and behaves nothing at all like twins\u2026even with only two parties.\n\nMore like polar opposites with more sides (and opinions) than can be counted on a calculator.It's not meant to actually pass - it's just standard negotiating tactic -- start with an extreme offer, then eventually settle for something less.Because Republicans want to torch everything down in time for the 24 election so they can point at something and say \"look at what the Democrats did\", rather then face scrutiny for their own shortcomings.I hope Biden's projection of confidence on this issue reflects that he's willing to go nuclear on it.\n\nThe Republicans are using something we all agree is necessary and required as a bargaining chip in demanding things the majority of Americans do not want. It's bizarrely backwards.\n\nIf ever there were an opportunity for Biden to show strength and unilaterally override Congress, this is it. There's a constitutional, legal, ethical argument to be made for just raising the debt limit by fiat. Let Congress throw a fit. Let it be dragged through the courts. Hell, let SCOTUS try to stop it. Biden can spend political capital on this, and it will pay dividends in way more political capital.\n\nMaybe I'm being Machiavellian on this, but this seems like a totally reasonable power play.There is a legitimate chance that some of our elected officials are controlled by a foreign government. And those officials have successfully manipulated their own party's policies so that 5 members can functionally control the party.\n\nIf McCarthy can't accept that he's going to lose the speakership and introduce a clean bill, we're fucked.Republicans love to make spectacles of traditionally boring standard procedures to keep generating headlines and clog up government so it can't discuss anything actually meaningful.Right on that boat with you.\n\nThis shit is stupid. Don't give it the time of day, say that Republicans refuse to do their job and pay the bills already incurred, and that the executive branch and treasury has a responsibility to the American people to ensure that the Country does not default on its debt.I hope he does this (probably won't) and force the GOP to sue to stop it it so it looks like the \"party of fiscal responsibility\" is trying to stop us from paying our debts.I don't know that it's actually unconstitutional. I find the argument... Tenuous. But I do think it's a nonfrivolous argument and, if he instructs the Treasury to ignore the debt ceiling, there's not really a remedy. It's not like SCOTUS is going to say, \"That was unconstitutional, so we now order you to declare retroactive default.\"I agree with you that it's not so much a debate as it is national hostage negotiations, but disagree that something that important should be ignored by the remaining sane people in this country.Biden said it must be a clean bill. He\u2019s not budging.[removed]Just point out how they want to slash bennies for the veterans and how the gop hates veterans.Was it?\n\nWhy does this article seem to say that pelosi and trump were negotiating spending and debt limit together? \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/twin-challenges-on-budget-trade-test-withering-pelosi-and-trump-relationship/2019/07/10/aed2d658-a2ad-11e9-b732-41a79c2551bf_story.html\n\n> Pelosi has made clear that any increase in the federal debt limit should come as part of a broader, two-year budget dealHave a link handy?Not necessarily, just 40 minutes of floor time 'controlled' by Gaetz.  Which, now that I type that, is still pretty bad.> C-SPAN callers\n\nA.k.a. the US Strategic Stupidity Reserve.I think it's 3 votes against or 6 abstentions but I'm no whip.\n\nEdit: The GOP has a 5 vote majority, but they have several absences this week per the AP article in the post above.I read in an earlier article that Republicans can afford just 4 unhappy Rs.How many of these failures will cause a holdout?There's only one other developed country which is Denmark.  And their debt ceiling is so high they are no risk in hitting it in the near future at all.My own home country of Denmark is the only other one with an absolute debt ceiling like US!\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know this until recently because coming close to hitting it has literally never been an issue.I'm Canadian, and if a budget isn't agreed upon our government dissolves and a new election is called.IIRC only Denmark, and I doubt that its exactly like ours, my guess its more reasonable.That\u2019s exactly what I figure it\u2019s going to turn into. Just wait for the nutters to get their time and start demanding things that aren\u2019t even in the bill. There is already disagreement on the bill and supposedly he can\u2019t get the votes right now to pass..Yes, it\u2019s because most of our politicians are children who only care about themselves and not the impact on AmericaIf they cared about the deficit they wouldn\u2019t have voted in the Trump-Era tax cuts.Democrats could have put an end to this by doing away with the debt ceiling when they had control. In fact, bills were introduced in both chambers in 2021, but went nowhere. Biden even said he was against abolishing the debt ceiling. \n\nSo, here we are... about to begin negotiations to cut Democratic programs, just like in 2011.  \n\n\nThe lack of Democratic action is telling: party leadership actually wants spending cuts, to mollify its wealthy donors. There's no other explanation for why they didn't act on this when they had the chanceIt's the Speaker election all over again.\n\nMcCarthy proposes something. Half a dozen Republicans object. He concedes something. Half a dozen Republicans still object.\n\nThey will only support this bill if it contains exactly what they want. And that makes it pretty much DOA in the Senate and will never reach the Resolute Desk.Cultural wars relieved them of the burden of thinking. It's not a burden they want to pick up again.Mace always does this, makes a show that she is going to vote no on something then even when there are no changes she votes for itMace is the easiest Republican to convince to fall in line. McCarthy just has to pinky promise and she's all set.Literally nothing, DOA in the Senate. If the bill as is was passed? The biggest deficit \"reducer\" (capping spending to within 1% of 2021 levels) is something that can be thrown away in the next budget and as such has no real teeth.\n\nOtherwise, throw out a bunch of the BBB bill, defund IRS, work requirements for medicaid etc.Not much, the house passed it but the senate will not ( probably ). I just shows that the Republicans in the House are in a position to negotiate with BidenNothing yet. It has to pass the senate, and even then Biden can veto, but that would mean we wouldn\u2019t get the debt ceiling raise. But the senate can \u201cedit\u201d the bill and send it back to the house.It means it\u2019s not making it through the Senate. It\u2019s laughably bad.No vote in the Senate. It\u2019s DOA.niceI helped send our boi from Orange County in NY, talk to the people way upstate and out in Long Island. Long Island especially they elected one of the biggest embarrassments to ever go to Washington.[removed]That's all the GOP does. Repeal the positive changes put in by democrats, sometimes promise a 'bettet solution' and then just not doing anything else. But the propaganda arm of the extreme right is powerful and well funded.It's not even just the wages. Fucking with schedules, requiring 100% availability while only scheduling part time keeps millions in poverty.They also wonder if at some point they'll turn to Hunter biden's laptop as well somehow.Why should able-bodied people between 18-55 not work at least 20 hours per week to receive benefits? There are exemptions for people with disabilities, children, pregnancy, or other dependents (such as those caring for parents or siblings). I feel like that's fair.\n\nThis is an honest question because I don't know who it primarily affects, but apparently it affects 275,000 people. What is currently making them unable to even perform community service at a minimum?Not shocking, the clowns like Mace talk about their \u2018concerns\u2019 then rubber stamp whatever garbage is given to themI mean they know Biden is not going to sign it, so why would anyone hold out when that just exposes them to interparty criticism when they can just wait for Biden to veto and blame him for everything? Same strategy they use the courts for.I love this lie. \u201cWe care about the children\u201d all while opposing a minimum wage increase for working families, states loosening child labor laws, and more states opposing free school lunches. \n\nThey sat there and literally said they will lead us to a default while also stating that biden\u2019s \u201cIRS army\u201d is planning to tax everybody more. Excuse me what?It's amazing how much they pull the kids card while fucking kids because they'll do jack shit about climate change and other issues that they will face.Jim McGovern has been, in the verbiage of editors (for some reason), absolutely SLAMMING Republicans in the opening arguments.\n\nI clipped his first remarks here: https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5068067/user-clip-rep-mcgovern-debt-ceilingIt's kind of a fun watch if you don't have anything important going on.  Parliamentary procedure can be really interesting and it's clear the Dems are playing a pretty solid game in that arena.It's the dumbest game of chicken to ever be played.\n\nIf this passes the house, and Manchin is wavering, and then there's Cruella Deville cosplayer Sinema who is completely unreliable - IF it gets through the Senate, Biden has said he'd veto it.\n\nWhich if that happened, then yeah we'd probably default.every other time this has happened over the last 80+ years, the debt ceiling has been raised or temporarily suspendedI'd give it 50/50 odds. If they can somehow force a clean bill on the house floor to raise the ceiling, there will be plenty of republicans who would vote for it to avoid the chaos it would cause. But would also lead to McCarthy having a no confidence vote held immediately to remove him as speaker. And with republican, their guiding principle is power at all costs.Most likely gop mega donors will step in and force a clean deal if nothing is reached to protect their assetsUnfortunately, culture wars and rage porn work for engaging conservatives - their voting numbers increased between 2016 and 2020. \n\nThey won't give up what works, it will continue likely through our lifetimes> what does that look like as far as the courts possibly being too late to intervene? Like sorry courts we already paid the bills...\n\nIt depends on what the courts credibility looks like when they come down with a ruling.\n\nDemocrats have layed the groundwork of questioning that credibility by inviting John Roberts - and since he declined, the next level of escalation - a subpoena - is probably already in the making.\n\nAnd if Roberts refuses to follow that subpoena, the Administration can say \"If you don't follow the law, why should we follow your rulings?\" and get on with the business of running the country, while SCOTUS tries to regroup.The risk of minting a trillion-dollar coin is inflationary. You're adding to your money-base so commercial bank reserves would rapidly increase as the Treasury spent the proceeds from the coins purchase by the Federal Reserve.  If banks proceed to loan out these new reserves, as they typically do, then money supply increases sharply and with that inflation- which then gets worse as the perception of grater inflation fuels more inflation. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nThere are of course ways to somewhat mitigate these outcomes but they ultimately depend on the financial markets having trust and faith in the United States economy and the minting of such coin I think would shake the markets greatly as the markets like consistency, predictability and stability and definitely not unknowns.\n\nedit : Imagine redditors thinking they know better than global economic experts and the federal reserve who have rejected this idea at face value because its inflationary.im sure the Independents outside of bernie sander's supporters would also lose their shitWhy is there a house chaplain?They've voted to bar her from the MT House floor for the remainder of the 2023 session.You're thinking of failing to pass a budget. This would be worse than that.Yeah this ain\u2019t just about shutting down the government. This is about our national credit rating, ability to finance our current account deficits, interest rates American consumers pay, dollar\u2019s strength as a global reserve currency, etcI imagine if we get THAT close to shitting the bed, they'll prob do the whole \"We'll raise it to get like 2 more weeks to continue negotiating.\" or something.Political posturing aside there was zero chance a clean spending bill was ever going to come out of the house. \n\nThe reality is now that it's going to be up to the Senate to pass something. Whether that's a clean bill or something else.  \n\nAnd then it would go back to the house for a vote under reconciliation. \n\nWow the desire is for a clean spending bill.  The reality is that this is a political hot potato.  Both sides will accuse the other side of not doing what's important for the country and neither side wants to be the one saying \"no.\" \n\nThe House Republicans want to be the ones saying we passed a bill, and the Senate isn't taking it up. The Senate Democrats want to be able to say that they passed something and the House Republicans aren't taking it up.   \n\nThat impasse will continue for a little bit, and only when they're down to the wire will any real negotiation happen.Nah, bill's dead alreadyThey won\u2019t be happy until Lavrov is running MedicaidNot all of us Republicans are with the Russians. Most likely myself support Ukraine. Slava Ukraini!It\u2019s their solution for all the gun violence in America.Passed the house. Which is majority republican. It won't go anywhere after thatThey aren\u2019t backing down. This bill has zero chance at becoming law and the Republicans know it.You know damn well that the Conservatives would burn the Earth to the ground, just so they could rule over the ashes.Yes, yes they will. Ask yourself what one person would benefit the most from a US default, then ask what US party is in bed with that person.Well, someone should tell him 90s Biden isn\u2019t president.That is also 30 years ago, things have changed since then. Trying to make a current bill seem more appealing by looking back multiple decades at an opinion that was not implemented then is not really a great argument.They did raise the debt ceiling...the debt ceiling being raised is only partisan when the GOP controls part of a Congress with a Democratic President.  When the Democrats controlled the House with Trump as President, it got raised with no issue because Democrats are the adults in the room60 vote threshold.Manchin, among other moderate Dems, was and is opposed to debt ceiling abolition.Yup, Manchin and Sinema wouldn\u2019t get rid of the filibuster in order to do this.My guess is that they knew that this battle would be a political disaster for the Republicans, and that in the worst case scenario, Biden has options to unilaterally avoid catastrophe (eg. declare the debt ceiling unconstitutional and direct the Treasury to disregard it, or even the trillion-dollar coin).The debt ceiling is always used as a bargaining chip for political purposes\u2026but now the GOP is crazy enough to have that back fire.One of them is getting cancer treatments.You're leaving top-level comments, not responding to other people.Why do you think there was any folding? No dems voted for the bill.Nothing and everything. \n\nIt's DOA in the Senate, since most the Republican bill means to cut all spending on Medicare, Veteran Support, and any social security left in the country. It would be political suicide to commit to that and Dems are stupid but they aren't that dumb. God help us if they are.Implying left and right are just two sides of the same coin is a false dichotomy. Conservatives have literally never been on the right side of history, have literally never contributed a single positive thing to society. Siding with conservatives is siding with bigotry. It should be far more one-sided.\n\nIf you think I'm wrong, name even a single positive accomplishment we can thank conservatism for, a single time conservatives were on the right side of history.What's the other side? Let the US economy nose dive off a cliff? Capitulate to Republicans taking us hostage? Why would you expect there to be a large number of voices advocating for those positions?The spending was already agreed on. This is like if your bank told you they didn\u2019t actually feel like sending money to the people you bought goods and services from. The decision to buy already happened. This vote should never be anything more than proceduralComparing a government budget to a household budget makes no sense.How about you really smart republicans explain how cutting trillions in taxes will decrease the deficit and national debt.The country is not a household.  The country cannot run out of money; the country is the thing that prints the money.How come you didn't have an issue with this under Trump?How about you \u201creally smart\u201d Republicans explain how not paying debt you have already agreed to is \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d?How about you smart republicans STOP giving trillion dollar tax cuts to the rich and take that money and pay the debt offThis is more like defaulting on your loans. You know that\u2019s pretty bad, right?You tell me... I assume this was discussed by Republicans when Trump raised the debt $3 Trillion.We borrow more? Like we have for the past hundred years? Like we did 3 times under the Trump presidency?Can't borrow forever, but the time to discuss that is when you're setting up the spending and income proposals (budget/taxes). Biden and the Democrats have said repeatedly that they're happy to have that conversation.\n https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3957926-biden-top-democrats-call-on-gop-to-present-clean-debt-limit-bill-hold-separate-negotiations/amp/\n\nThis is McCarthy yelling about not paying the credit card bill after the money has already been spent. Defaulting on your debts isn't sane fiscal policyMacro vs Micro Economics ladies and gentlemenWe print more since we\u2019re not on the gold standard any more.  Our entire financial system relies solely on the fact that the US government pays it\u2019s bills, or at least they did until the domestic terrorists took over.   For the millionth time, household finance has literally nothing in common with modern monetary policy.We raise taxesProbably the same thing that the Republicans did under Trump? I'll bet you had zero issues with deficit spending or debt then.  \n\n\nOn the topic of the Republican default talks, this is not the time for the Republicans to fuck over the working class. The time for them to float their unpopular \"austerity for the middle class\" ideas is during open budgeting negotiations not when we should pay the legal, agreed upon services and goods.Fiscal responsibility like gutting funding to the IRS?Fiscal responsibility like Trump running up the debt $7 trillion, while making no issue of the debt ceiling during that time?Ah yes, the minority needs to cave.  Good plan.  The only ones who will wreck the world's economy have an R next to their name.\n\nEdit: spelling.How about Republicans honor the debts that have been budgeted/approved and are due? The time to fuck over the middle class is in open budget discussions, but then Republican \"austerity for the middle class/poor\" ideals are on full display and are harder to hide so I get why they do shit like this.Why would you negotiate with admitted domestic terrorist?We'll see if this bill can get 218 votes.  I doubt it.\n\nA clean bill would get 218 votes in the House, because there are probably at least five Republicans who value the economy more than spite, but that's why they aren't considering one.Hopefully the GOP will realize that their rich buddies are going to get fucked if the economy tanks.[removed]Democrats should just write a clean House bill to either increase the debt ceiling to an amount required to get us past the November 2024 election or waive the ceiling till then.  If the associated House committee doesn\u2019t consider the bill then after 30 days the Democrats can file a discharge petition and if they get 218 signees then a full House vote must occur.  They must start this very soon due to the various delays that discharge petitions require.  Without a discharge petition Biden should just mint a ten trillion dollar or larger platinum coin.Those interest payments are going to increase a hell of a lot more if the US defaults on its debt or even comes close to it. \n\n>We need to balance the budget or the US is headed towards inevitable default. \n\nThis is\u2026 not how things work.We'd be better off if Trump hadn't added $7.8 trillion to the deficit.This isn't supposed to be a budget negotiation, there's literally a specific time for that which already happened. This is whether or not we should cover what we've already spent. Paying your bill vs planning your spending.We can talk about cutting spending sure, but not in this bill.  Do you control your own budget by refusing to pay your credit card bill?Pinching pennies and nickel-and-diming starved civic programs that benefit working class America is not a step in the right direction. Cutting the defense budget by at least 25%, repealing the Trump tax cuts, and increasing taxation on corporations and the ultra-wealthy would be a step in the right direction. Hurting those that are already hurting while not even touching those with plenty to spare is why America is a 3rd-world country with a 1st-world veneerChoosing to pay our incurred debt and increasing the limit in order to do so has zero to do with negotiating a budget. The republicans are literally holding the American economy hostage for political theater.So are you furious at trump for his crazy increase in the national debt?This new Republican Congress is a different brand of stupid though. They just want to watch the world burn and Kevin can\u2019t control them.It's like the Republicans are holding an unloaded gun to the head of America, demanding concessions from the Democrats...but it's entirely a bluff.It takes 60 votes to remove it. Dems have never had that recently.\n\nEven during Obama's administration. The 60-seat majority only lasted a few months in 2009, ACA was prioritized, and the likes of Lieberman and others existed. The debt ceiling crisis wasn't weaponized (for the first time in history) until 2 years later.\n\nHindsight is 20/20, but I doubt you'd find many people worried about it back in 2009 when it had been raised something like 80+ times in history without any issue.There is another explanation, which happens to be the case: Democratic majorities in both chambers in 2021 were slim, and the Democratic coalition includes a minority of moderates who are unwilling to eliminate the debt ceiling.  Plus, of course, zero Republicans who were/are willing to eliminate the debt ceiling.\n\nThe votes in Congress just weren't there, and they won't be until there the left/progressive/liberal Democrats hold a majority in Congress.Or that Mancin and Sinema are republicans and wouldn't have voted for it.\n\nBlanket lifting it would be wildly open to abuse. Next time a republican controls the show there's no limit to the damage they could do.Listen man...Trump inherited a 650 billion deficit from Obama. In two years Trump and Republicans wiped away 8 years of progress on deficits and the result was a 1.3 trillion dollar deficit before Covid hit. All because the pos wanted to brag about the economy. There has never been a single Republican president that has ever lowered the deficits. Not one. There has been multiple Democrat presidents that have lowered the deficits. Who the fuck cuts taxes when we have 4 percent unemployment? At least Covid spending had a reason. \n\nI tried to have a conversation with my dad who is a Republican and they just do not get it. Christ man the last time a Republican president left office with a lower unemployment than they inherited was 1989. 34 god damn years ago.They should do something about student loan payments restarting with untamed inflation, continually rising interest rates, and a banking industry that seems increasingly unreliable. It's crazy to think that we can all magically afford student loan payments again just because the virus has weakened- the economy is still fucked and I'm guessing most people don't have an extra couple hundred bucks or so a month to kick back to the loan industry.Did they not just follow with citing 1996 and 2011?We need a big win in 2024 and one of the first bills setting limits on DoD spending and another saying the debt of the United States shall be paid automatically. No more of this nonsense where the republicans run up a huge tax cut driven deficit and try and blame the poorThe next time they may demand that Biden step down and Trump re-instated as president as a condition for raising the ceiling.The cruelty is the pointUkraine and China putting pressure on Taiwann shows why the US has high defense spending.With Russian aggression in Europe and China threatening Taiwan now is probably not the time to cut defense spending\u2026 \n\nThe next war is probably going to be a lot worse than we\u2019ve seen in a long time. \ud83d\ude15It's more general than that - all the culture war stuff  exists to divide the working class because both parties are well paid to serve the donor class and a united working class with any political will is terrifying to them.   The rest is bread and circuses.Actually, their last national platform, such as it was, was could pretty accurately be boiled down to simply: \"We support Trump\".\n\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/The_Republican_Party_Platform,_2020\n\nhttps://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/docs/Resolution_Platform_2020.pdf\n\n---\n\nSo yeah, what you said.They can have the discussion and beat that drum after the ceiling is raised when a budget is being debated. The problem is the GOP knows the American public do not support them in those policies and need to hold the nation hostage as the only method to try and get what they want.A lot of Democrats don\u2019t really talk enough about how they\u2019re the ones supporting veterans and not republicans I think its because a lot of their younger base doesn\u2019t understand that you can be anti-war but still pro-veteran, but I think they should call republicans out on that more often.They also want to repeal the IRA which just past under a previous Democratic majority. It already passed. They\u2019re basically saying that anything the Democrats do can be repealed at anytime by just holding the American economy hostage.They've confused themselves into thinking that in doing so makes them patriots.\n\nIt's lunacy.They have no illusions whatsoever about it. They know precisely what they are doing, the only deluded ones are the GOP voters who think the people they are electing will ever do anything to help them. Other than making good on their promises to be needlessly, unrelentingly cruel to anyone who isn't white, Christian and male.\n\nThey'll also make life miserable for those people, too, but that's a fringe benefit.He thinks long pauses make him a good speakerHe will have his name on the Bakersfield airport and we will all witness it!As great as that would be, Manchin is already signaling opposition to a clean bill and saying Biden should \"negotiate\" with McConnell. Meanwhile, Sinema is just waiting until it's her vote that's the deciding vote, so she can snap her fingers while she kills it.Well luckily we now have 51 senators so, it means that the heat would be on one of them. I don't think even Sinema wants to be the one Rouge senator responsible for tanking millions of jobs. That would kill stocks and her shot at the cushy lobbying job she is gunning for.I'm fairly certain they'd be fine with a 100% clean bill with no chasers.They can certainly try. Tens of thousands of people furloughed because the Republicans are completely incapable of governing plays far better in front of the camera and social media than McCarthy trying to blame democrats.\n\nThe only thing McCarthy has been doing well is reinforcing the GOP caucus' incompetence, and I am loving every second of it.An ad the explains that the debt ceiling money is money that Congress has already spent, so the current shenanigans are akin to refusing to pay a mortgage payment or credit card bill. \n\nThe US has already had a credit rating reduction once because of GOP actions in this area. \n\nAlso, GOP only finds the debt ceiling when there\u2019s a Democratic President. It somehow mysteriously disappeared under Trump even though Federal spending increased. \n\nThis tactic is harmful to the country and needs to stop.\"Republicans are playing games and fucking around, as they had no problem raising the debt ceiling with no strings attached under Trump (and have raised the debt ceiling twice as often under Republican presidents, than under Democratic presidents. And Republicans have never complained about raising the debt ceiling during Republican presidencies), and you'll be the one to find out and reap the consequences!\"The appropriations were already made, the money was already spent. This does not apply.  This is about raising an arbitrary limit on the amount of debt the US can have.> The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.Too many people want to be lied to.That or going straight down D or R no matter what.They want to push extremely unpopular policies like cutting social security that people have paid for and that they depend on for staying out of homelessness in retirement. Or repeal student debt forgiveness. Or cut IRS agents that are cracking down on rich tax cheats.\n\nThey also want to blame democrats for the cuts.\n\nOr they want the economy to crash to blame democrats.\n\nThe fucking media is stupidly reporting what republicans are saying like \"We need to reduce the debt\" without pushing back. Because it doesn't make any sense. Cutting the IRS INCREASES the deficit it doesn't decrease it, and this is money already spent.\n\nRepublicans are doing this because the people who vote for republicans are too stupid to realize what they're saying is fucking stupid and nonsensical and has been for decades. A ruined economy or extremely popular programs being cut would make some very dumb people blame Joe Biden, and republicans hope they'll be able to get back into power to further destroy democracy.As a parent of identical twins that are polar opposites - it can definitely happen this way lolNormally I would agree with you, but we are now governed by the stupid in the house.  They make each change more right wing to get the right wing vote.  They will lose them if they loosen the worst amendments.  They can only lose 4 votes.  I have zero faith in McCarthy to get anything like a compromise.> It's not meant to actually pass - it's just standard negotiating tactic -- start with an extreme offer, then eventually settle for something less.\n\nconsidering the levels of stupidity during the house speaker confirmation I worry that this isn't just negotiating in bad faith, but all out self destruction.It\u2019s all fun and games until we get our credit rating downgraded again.The Hastert rule is one of the worst things Dennis Hastert ever did. Not *the* worst, of course.problem is, it's a Catch-22, the instant he does it, they'll impeach him and keep on impeaching him until the election time.Fourteenth amendment: \u201cThe validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\u201d\n\n>Debt of US\n>Authorized by law, aka congress passes it\n> shall not be questioned\n\nDepends on how you define \u201cquestioned\u201d. But not sure what other way their is to question it. Especially in context.[deleted]So? You can't negotiate with terrorists, their demands never stop and their actions escalate.\n\nThe Republicans are aware of the damage they have done and will do.\n\nTHEY DO NOT CARE\n\nThey will try and burn down everything instead. If the democrats cave all they're doing is garunteeing this childish behavior every time.Pelosi made demands but never threatened a default. In fact, they even declined to wield a filibuster on it during Trumps years.\n\n\u201c\u2026Democrats, however, have signaled that they are disinclined to take that route. The mere prospect that it could fall on them to solve the debt ceiling conundrum left some party lawmakers seething, particularly after they joined Republicans to raise and suspend the ceiling under Trump out of a belief that the issue is too dire to politicize\u201d\n\n[WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/07/21/republicans-debt-ceiling/)https://www.youtube.com/live/HHEK0-Lv4_Q?feature=share\n\nRewind a bit, the whole hearing is good. But Biggs and gates were the last ones and they lost it\n\nEdit: Rep Chip Roy is a self aware wolveLuckily I'll be on my lunch break at that time I think, so I'll be saving some brain cells \ud83e\udd1eGod I hate abstentions. Make the people vote yes or noThis isnt even a budget. This is just some dumb shit that says \"oh ya we'll bill the bills on the budget we already past last year\".\n\nThis used to not even be a thing that was fought over, it just was raised until GQP decided to make it a thing to push their unpopular policiesI also don\u2019t think ours exists literally in breach of our own constitution.And made corporate ones permanent but peoples expire so they can yell about tax cuts during election year. All nit permanent as violated rules so oops don't prioritize people.Please see [the responses that you received to your other comment of this claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12zkuh6/discussion_thread_house_of_representatives/jhsrdqg/).The debt ceiling is basically a made up/arbitrary number anyway, that's why it was raised when Trump was presBut she \"felt heard!\"Barely. Albeit the 4 Republicans that voted against it did so because they didn't think spending cuts were enough, this literally only passed by the sway of 1 vote. They even had to make edits to appease some of the Republicans that were against it despite originally saying they wouldn't edit it.\n\nIf anything, this just shows how weak the Republicans are and how divided their party is. I read that it was originally something like 9-11 Republicans that were against it before the edits and they could only have 4 be against it to have it pass.Damn straight.  Now, I'm represented by a guy who's gonna plead to crimes in Brazil after denying crimes and making other fabrications.This is a pretty blatant political game by the GOP. Just raise the debt limit like they have done countless times when a republican was president. It's deranged to try and justify not paying our debt and endangering the world's largest and most powerful economy..just because you hate poor people or whatever garbage they're pushing>The House passed the bill. Biden has refused to meet or have any discussions over it. How do you \"figure out how to get things passed\" when one side refuses to talk?\n\nBiden has not \"refused to talk.\" He's been explicitly clear from the outset - the House needs to pass a clean debt limit bill, like the Dems did 3 times during the trump presidency, and he will sign it.\n\nBiden talks about this frequently. The issue is the GOP refusing to **listen** when biden does talk.> How do you \"figure out how to get things passed\" when one side refuses to talk?\n\nHow about during budget negotiations, IDK, last year? This is like buying a new car and then refusing to make the payments because you weren't happy with the price you negotiated at the dealer.Maybe Republicans shouldn't balk on paying their bills? Maybe the Republican house should stop acting like children and taking healthcare away from American Veterans, elderly, and children?\n\nThis isn't a both sides issue. This is purely Republicans holding onto a bomb acting like it's Biden's fault they don't put it down and walk away.Republicans have passed it countless times with no strings. It should be passed with no strings. This is an attempt to fuck over the world economy and ours so they can blame Biden.The time for discussing spending cuts is the budget, not the debt ceiling. We have already spent the money, paying our debts is non negotiable and tying spending cuts to it is political theater.There is nothing to talk about.  Republicans either choose to pass a clean bill like McCarthy did 4 times under Trump or he doesn't.  This isn't the time to be debating spending.  You do that for future spending when passing budget bills.  This is a n authorization  to pay for programs that Republicans and Democrats supported and adopted the last few years under Trump/Biden.Why would any sane person negotiate with Republicans on their regressive bullshit?  \n\nI would question the intelligence, morals, and political savvy of anyone in Biden's shoes who even considered for a moment working with Republicans in Congress.>The House passed the bill. Biden has refused to meet or have any discussions over it. How do you \"figure out how to get things passed\" when one side refuses to talk?\n\nIts really simple.  The debt ceiling should not be up for negotiation.  Raising it would be to cover things the government already agreed to pay for, from both parties.  If Republicans want to cut spending that can be done for the next budget.  But the two should not be linked together in any way.  More importantly, defaulting on our debts is literally unconstitutional.There\u2019s nothing to talk about lmao, the gop has essentially told the democrats to undo and go against everything they believe in and stand for as a party or they\u2019ll destroy the economy. What\u2019s the point of passing anything if the second the gop gets a hold of a chamber they can just hold the nation hostage to enact their extreme agendaBecause it has to pass the Senate. Also, there was nothing to negotiate since McCarthy didn\u2019t have any bill till today.I know but it\u2019s more tired and absurd than ever.And for what? To stuff the pockets of the rich, their personal pockets - it\u2019s just lootingYeah, while Rome burns, stay busy with these priorities. Nebraska hasn\u2019t  passed a bill all session because it\u2019s too busy trying to shut up one legislator because she\u2019s trans. Whole session. Who do these clowns think  are going to pick up the pieces of their ignorant destruction? I\u2019m amazed we haven\u2019t been invaded.No job anywhere in the US *guarantees* hours, it\u2019s not law in any state to my knowledge. My industry is erratic, there could be 24 hours one week, 13 the next, 35 after that\u2026 Also no job security. Also keeps people trapped in miserable work conditions with abusive employers.studies show it doesn't help. it's theater for the right wing like drug testing that hurts or doesn't help the situationWho do they work for and what do they get paid?\n\nWho does the book keeping to track of everyone?\n\nWhat happens if there is a mistake? \n\nThere is so much work to make sure only the 'worthy' get the benefit...\n\nPeople wouldn't need these benefits if they were 'worthy'. They need the benefits to help them become worthy again.If a person was able bodied and became unable to work they would be forced to wait 2 years for a hearing. During that time, the person that is unable to work would have to working a minimum of 20 hours a week and make less than 500 a month to qualify; however, no judge will rule a person eligible of working 20 hours/week and even if the judge somehow conceded they can't really work they would be disqualified by making too much.\n\nThey might as well have made this the Catch 22 Act. \n\nFor those that haven't read the book. The rule was that a pilot could not qualify for getting grounded and set home unless a doctor would diagnose them \"crazy.\" The rule also said that anyone that didn't want to fly cannot be considered crazy, because only a crazy person would want to go on a mission.Why are we putting more burdens on people less fortunate? So if someone isn't working in your opinion, they should just do what exactly???die?[Here's an article that discusses findings of efforts along similar lines during the Trump administration.](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/states-experiences-confirm-harmful-effects-of-medicaid-work-requirements)\n\nIt was fairly disastrous in every single case, only mitigated in some states by courts or the states themselves pausing the requirement.The federal disability bureaucracy is 1. inaccessible, 2. takes literally years to get through, 3. has sub-poverty income limits and asset limits, and 4. strips benefits from people who marry.\n\nSo if you have to go through that bureaucracy to get the disability exemption, most disabled people aren't going to qualify.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid for low-income people, because it was cheaper than going through the private system. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid_coverage_gap And if we're cut off from Medicaid, without enough money to qualify for subsidies, well, we may not have enough to pay for health care.Because healthcare should be a human right.To even get to a point where Biden has the opportunity to veto it, it needs to pass the Senate where the Democratic party holds a majority. I really don't think it can get that far.Don't forget the literal f*cking of kids with their refusal to do anything to stop child brides.Thank you, much appreciatedEven if all those things happened, Biden could still issue an executive order declaring the debt ceiling to be unconstitutional and directing the Treasury Department to disregard it.Sinema was very reliable.  You give her a big check and you can count on her voting for you.Biden won't veto it, even if it was filled with awful shit. He needs the govt to keep working.Yeah I know \u2014 but the level of craziness in this Congress on the R side beats out even the craziness of the last few times we did this dance. Many R\u2019s in this Congress were not around when we played the debt limit chicken game last time. And they seem dumb as rocks. They might just be willing to destroy the economy. I fear.[removed]It is not inflationary. The money is already spent.The median voter in the USA is, even in 2023, a Christian.\n\nEdit: Not saying that that's right, but it is *why*.Effectively disenfranchising her entire district. Disgusting. I seem to recall a certain important line in the declaration of independence... Something about \"taxation without representation...\"The ONLY compromise Dems should entertain is to minimize INCREASES in spending.  This is all about paying the debt we\u2019ve already incurred.\n\nDems need to be willing to force a default here.  Pass the clean no-increase spending bill, then wait for the GOP to sign it.  And be on the airwaves every damn day pointing out it is the Republicans taking hostages - the Senate is just fulfilling past obligations.\n\nOh yes, a default would really, really hurt.  A lot of people would suffer.  The thing is\u2026it\u2019s deserved at this point.  No matter what insanity the GOP brings, the Dems bail them out time and again to put out the fire.  And time and again, voters send Republicans back to office, because they never see the consequences of Republicans in power.\n\nThey voted for a Republican House.  Let them have it.[deleted]Well shit, my bad. Guess I assumed that all of the House Dems were there.Example of education cuts in action.Oo! oo! Let me try! Let me try! \n\n\nIt was\u2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing! *shocked pikachu face*[removed]>This vote should never be anything more than procedural\n\nSlight correction, this vote should never be required. Period.\n\nThe time to control spending is, as notes, is when the spending bills are passed.\n\nArguably, not allowing the Treasury to pay ALL bills is unconstitutional per the 14th amendment, section 4:\n\n>**The validity of the public debt of the United States**, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, **shall not be questioned**.\n\nI know why the Republican's keep the \"debt limit\" around, since it gives them exactly the kind of lever they are abusing right now. I don't know why abolishing it hasn't been a bigger goal for the Dems. If it would not be so destructive to the. US and global economy (and with the current SCOTUS, the outcome would be up in the air), I'd like to see the debt limit challenged in court.jwd461 should read this: https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/10/06/the-debt-ceiling-an-explainer/Careful...if you point out that money is a made up concept and all we should be talking about is actual resource constraints their head may legitimately explode.\n\nI don't know why they're worried anyway, all of those \"really smart republicans\" will just go get more money through contrived conquest if they are really that concerned about it.[removed]Republicans: \"Something something that was actually Pelosi's fault, wahhh wahh\"[removed]While true that we won't inevitably default with a perpetual deficit, we can't literally spend an infinite amount of money, either.\n\nSolution is to elect fiscally responsible leaders, who are pretty disproportionately Dems.> Those interest payments are going to increase a hell of a lot more if the US defaults on its debt or even comes close to it. \n\nCorrect, this will be on Biden if he refuses to negotiate. \n\n\n>This is\u2026 not how things work.\n\nThen how does it work exactly? If you keep borrowing money, you eventually have to pay it back + the interest.It doesn't need to be the entire Congress, maybe 3 converts will be enough.I'm betting Biden will be happy to call out their bluff too. He's already told McCarthy to show him the budget. He's seen this song and dance before while he was VP during the last debt ceiling crisis while Obama was in office.>but it's entirely a bluff\n\nWe hope...And, there's no way they get 60 democratic votes to remove the debt ceiling with the 2009 majority.Biden doesn't need to wait for Congress to remove it. He could simply declare it unconstitutional under the 14th amendment and order the Treasury to ignore the debt ceiling altogether all while daring the GOP to challenge it in court and laying it at their feet if there's a default.Wasnt it weaponized in 95 though? Granted, again by Republicans.How has Biden passed anything, if it takes 60 votes? Somehow he finds a way to get around that when he wants to...\n\nAnd more importantly in this case, Biden has said definitively that he does not want to remove debt ceilingWe're saying the same thing... Democratic party is not united on debt ceiling...because some of them want the resulting spending cuts.\n\nIncluding Biden himself who said no to abolishing the debt ceiling, and put no push behind the alternative plan to shift control of ceiling to Treasury. \n\nGOP is not the sole source of this problem, is my pointSo basically back when people quit when caught doing bad stuff to prevent 'tarnishing the honor of the office' and the concept of people attempting to over throw democracy was unthinkable? \n\n...Those were simpler times.>and another saying the debt of the United States shall be paid automatically\n\nThe debt ceiling isn't about paying debt, it's about how much debt we're allowed to have. \n\nCongress loves the debt ceiling and will never get rid of it because it's a problem they create (they set both how much will be spent and how much debt can be raised in bonds) that only they can fix but is usually blamed on the president.Ukraine and Taiwan military assistance is a blip compared to the overall US defense budget; it has also been supplemented by appropriation bills over the last year or so. Additionally, the US spends roughly 3 times as much as China on defense, and other nations fall significantly behind both. We can't even document and trace what we spend our budget on- that's how large it is.I think an argument could be made about spending a budget more wisely, vs just increasing it year over year into perpetuity.>With Russian aggression in Europe and China threatening Taiwan now is probably not the time to cut defense spending\u2026 \n\n\n\nYou're basically saying \"there's never going to be a good time to cut defense spending\", which is absolute bullshit. \n\n\nWe aren't the world police, and we most definitely *can* cut defense spending without hampering our ability to deal with either (or both) of those things. To act like we need to keep that budget high (or continue to raise it) is asinine fearmongering bullshit.The next catastrophic war is not inevitable.The [\u201cTwo Whatevers\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Whatevers) of the GOPThey\u2019re doing what any hostage taker would do, their ideas are fringe, they what they other people won\u2019t give so they resort to hurting others in attempt to get what they wantWhat's so infuriating is that their constituents will get bent over by their elected officials, who will then proceed to blame Democrats for being the \"true villains\" and the root cause of all their woes...\n\n.... when the information to validate that is RIGHT at their fingertips. \n\nLike, they can go on Yahoo News forums and bemoan the countries troubles, blaming Democrats for everything under the sun going wrong, but they can't (won't) navigate to a different fucking tab and actually look up the voting record of who does what and the impact it has.\n\nAnd then to make it worse, they won't vote for Democrats due to their tribalism, and the fact that if any of their friends/family/coworkers found out they didn't blanket R vote, they'd get scorned and be an outcast. \n\nIt's totally fucked and I watched this happen to my father until he was someone I didn't even recognize or know anymore.>white, Christian and male\n\nYou forgot Christian.Manchin is going to say whatever he thinks helps him win re-election next year.The 60 vote threshold applies to this bill. Reconciliation is a once per annual budget exception.Manchin is indicating he isn't and calling for Biden to \"negotiate\" with McConnell.> Tens of thousands of people furloughed\n\nYou're confusing a government shutdown (which we've had a few times in recent years) with a default (has never happened, at least in this context). Inability for the government to pay people means a lot more than furloughs of the public sector. The stock market implodes (likely taking the world market with it), social security stops being paid etc. It's not just the economic ripples - any extended period of time where the US government can't support the many people who rely on it for food and healthcare is likely to lead to a significant loss of life.Thanks.  You failed to answer the actual question.  You are blaming the GOP for the existing problem, but Joe Biden and Dems are in control of current spending.  The debt ceiling has been reached. \n\nWhat has Joe offered or the Dem legislators offered in this current situation?  It has been pending for many months.   That is a fact (check google).  \n\nShould both sides meet and discuss?  YES.  BUT JOE BIDEN has refused!They are?  The last time the debt ceiling was an issue, even CNN acknowledged that dems were not telling the truth.  [https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/24/politics/mccarthy-democrats-debt-ceiling-fact-check/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/24/politics/mccarthy-democrats-debt-ceiling-fact-check/index.html)\n\nJoe Biden keeps authorizing more and more expenses and shows no way to pay for them, is an issue! The 2023 debt ceiling issue is an absolute issue for the President in office since January 2021.  Blaming others is not applicable 2+ years after taking office!No one is claiming that US debt isn't valid, the house delegated the power to issue bonds to the executive brand years ago but with a limit on how much those bonds can be. That limit is the debt ceiling. \n\nIs the argument literally that Congress can delegate the issuance of bonds but not place limits on the delegated power?I mean, I'd certainly consider a vote for an \"R\", if theyd ever put forth something worth voting for. \n\nThey just...havent, since I reached voting age a couple decades back.\n\nAnd I'll keep refusing to vote Republican, while theyre a bunch of shit-assed MAGA doofuses.That sounds like a you and me problem, and not a politician's problem.Yep.  The worst thing was the pedophilia, for those who don't know.So?? Bogus Impeachment>defaulting on the debt and permanently damaging America's economic standing not only at home, but in the entire world. Something like that could cement China as the leading economic power, globallyYeah but it won\u2019t go through. Also Dems can easily spin that as Republicans trying to remove Biden because he refused to allow America to default\u2026Imagine impeaching a President because he paid the bills that was agreed on.  I say let them.  Impeachment won't pass the Senate.That just means we need to pay interest on debt and eventually pay it off.  It doesn't mean we have to pay Social Security or fund defense, or really anything else.[deleted]The Republicans insane plan is throwing it out anyway.\n\nThe Republicans need to come to reality. The Republicans need to compromise instead of always holding a gun to the countries head.Republicans are at fault here. This is unprecedented.Biden: I won't approve a messy budget.\n\nThis guy: Why would Biden do this?If it's the 11th hour, then there's really no other choice. A default is disastrous for the country, and politically for Democrats. If there isn't a recession, they're much better placed to trounce Republicans next year. \n\nThis is part of the fundamental imbalance of power between D and R. Republicans have no morals nor shame, and are perfectly willing to fuck everyone over. Democrats can't allow that, at the end of the day. \n\nThat said, I want them to fight until that 11th hour. Keep pushing a clean bill, get it through the Senate, and then pressure the House until they crack. They barely passed this bill -- they could not lose even one more vote. With how loosely they're holding on, it shouldn't be impossible to get 5 GOP representatives from bluer areas. If McCarthy doesn't want to bring it to a vote, call for a snap speaker vote to pass the bill.Saying there was a negotiation implicitly says there was a give on both sides from their desires.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/744104213/hill-and-trump-administration-close-in-on-2-year-budget-deal\n\nIt\u2019s clear one side currently is willing to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for cuts on spending.. and one side is not willing to budge on spending.\n\nIn prior years there has been successful active negotiation on these two principles. As it stands now\u2026 one party is not coming to the table for how they will meet the other sides wishes at least even partially.Better carb up, it's going to be a marathon of stupidity!While the debt ceiling is technically separate from the budget, it has come up now because it's being used here as a weapon in negotiations over the current budget under consideration.ABA Journal: [Is debt limit unconstitutional? Answer is yes, some argue, based on the 14th Amendment's public debt clause](https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/is-the-debt-limit-unconstitutional-some-argue-the-answer-is-yes-based-on-the-14th-amendments-public-debt-clause)Exactly. So why not do away with it? Its only purpose is backdoor spending cuts... But Biden supports itShe\u2019s like an even sadder version of Collins, she never even gets Jack squat for her pitiful displays of indecision.  Well I guess she gets media attention which is I suppose why she does it[removed]It's literally been a bipartisan full support ordain task for the last 80 years.

It also includes community service.And it takes tons of bureaucracy and costs money to administer. It distracts recipients from the path they need to take to genuinely get ahead. And again, they are already working. Pay them a living wage. What do they want? GOP would love to adopt the 19th century British workhouse I suppose? \n\nMeanwhile, we have a country to get running smoothly and they are obsessed with instituting austerity to prime the pump for tax breaks for the rich. That\u2019s not where we want to go. They are so out of it, they don\u2019t even have all that much Wall Street support anymore.These should not be concerns. These are all part of regular employment. If you are working hours, they are tracked as part of a pay stub. If they are not tracked accurately, the employer is doing something illegal and they should file a DOL claim. That is not something that would prevent someone from having gainful employment.\n\nIt also does not matter what they get paid. It could be minimum wage, but it is irrelevant because it is something rather than nothing.Sorry, this is not healthcare.\n\nBut I agree with that.TIL.\n\nThis whole situation is so stupid, and our new normal is just chaos. So tired of this shit, it happens way too often.Print the trillion dollar coinWith this debt ceiling nonsense dating back to the Clinton administration I've been waiting for someone in power to actually assert the 14th Amendment.  This would mean the SCOTUS would then get to decide whatever they want unfortunately.\n\n\"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\"I'm pretty sure he will actually.  That's got a lot of awful in that bill.Luckily the craziness in the R's have made it easy for a small group of more sensible R's to  work with the D's if things get really bad. \n\nI don't see that happening before 2 weeks of government shutdown at the earliest but that option is on the table.All their donors will lose millions if not billions stock value when the economy fails. Not sure they will let that happen.We have some kind of debt ceiling that was added to our Constitution in 2009 in Germany.\n\nBut it's not just an arbitrary line in the sand, but more of a flexible, yearly deficit limit, based on the GDP.\n\nHowever, this rule allows for further spending in case of ecological and economical emergencies. it doesn't really specificy what constitutes such an emergency in great detail though. The emergency-clause was used during the Corona-Pandemic for example.Of course it's inflationary. \n\nThe coin doesn't cease to exist after you've spent it. It ends up in the hands of banks and creditors and then individuals and people. Any economist will tell you that If money supply goes up by one trillion dollars and the amount of goods and services flowing through the economy remain the same that is by its very definition inflationary.\n\nAdditionally, the federal reserve already has the means to print more money to pay off debt infact but they choose not to do so because it fuels inflation. This is a known quantity. There is no room for debate this is very simple economics.\n\nAnd before you point out raising the debt ceiling as being no different to printing money. It absolutely is. Debt =/= Money supply and if the US could just mint trillion dollar coins to pay off its entire national debt without there being a knock on effect on the American and global economy don't you think they would've by now?A Hindi dude led the prayer once and some idiot Republicans threw a fit because it violated the Ten Commandments. The irony was so thick you can see it on video.\n\nStrict separation is the only way to go at this point. No citations, quotes, references to religions on the taxpayer dime by a public official. If they can\u2019t hold their tongue, strike it and censure.So I found out she can still vote and add written thoughts online, which is something at least. I was really confused about what they did because it made no sense, but that's how Montana does censures. Most states censure seems to just be ceremonial but it's more in Montana. Still really awful this happened and I wish it had gotten more coverage. Gloria Johnson from TN is my state house rep so I know how this feels for all of them and hopefully, even though it already happened, she can get more national media to shine a light on Montana's republican super majorityNo, democrats should counter with a bill that cuts even more spending, and it should all be from the defense budget. Submit a budget that \"only\" makes the US spend 3x as much a China, as opposed to 4x as muchAnd yet, you can't name even a single positive accomplishment we can thank conservatism for, or a single time conservatives were on the right side of history.\n\nI knew you wouldn't be able to, because I've been asking this question of conservatives for a long time, and I've yet to get a single answer.\n\nAnd still, conservatives will persist in conservatism because the allure of bigotry is strong.*Citation neededWhat did you digress from? Commenting on the point of view redditors hold seems pretty germane to your first commentLmao, you are brink of going full \"taxation is theft\" while whining about a balanced budget. And you did go all \"bOtH sIdEs\" in a previous comment.\n\nLiberatians are the flat earthers of politics.I think their job is to bring in revenue - something you might want if you supposedly care about the deficit.Agents that generate significantly more in taxes than they cost. Small businesses won\u2019t have to do taxes any differently as long as they are honestMostly they terrorize tax cheating multi-millionaires and billionaires, which is cool and the definition of fiscal responsibility.Irs phone wait time has already dropped from 27 minutes last year to 4 minutes this year. Customer service isn't terrorism.Few small businesses don\u2019t have over $400,000 in profits.> a balanced budget\n\nThe time to do that is when the budget is decided, not when the bills for last year's budget come due.Great, but holding the debt ceiling hostage isn't how it's done.>We can\u2019t literally spend an infinite amount of money\n\nI mean, seeing as the US prints its own money, we actually *could* do that (the semantics of spending literally \u201cinfinite\u201d amounts aside). \n\nI\u2019m not saying doing that would be a good idea (especially if we\u2019re spending it on dumb stuff like jet fuel that the Air Force dumps in the sea to secure next years\u2019 budget), but it is possible. \n\nI think a lot of people like the OP see the national debt like it\u2019s a credit card debt or something.It works by raising the debt ceiling first. This is for payments we already agreed to. United States credit and honor at stake to pay what we said we're going to pay.\n\nThen you go bat on the next \"spending\" bill discussion. I'm all open for the so-called \"fiscal conservative\" party to actually put forth policies that addresses the long term economic stability of the country. But please, don't just purpose to cut off benefits. Yeah the dollar amount will go down, but the people lost government services. That's not real savings.No it'll be on house Rs. Unlike Obama, Biden knows how to play the republicans in public.McCarthy can negotiate with Jeffery\u2019s. Also, no one is going to call on the US to pay their debt suddenly. Most money is owed to tax payers and anyone who demands immediate payment will suddenly have worthless money. Also, every Western Country, but Denmark (which has a limit they will never hit anytime soon), doesn\u2019t have a debt ceiling.How? He did not write the bills proposed by the house majority. They are the ones who choose to play this game of chicken, with debt we already agreed to, for the sake of what exactly? Crashing the dollar for the sake of political grandstanding is not a sound investment.This is among several options that I'm sure isn't completely off the table, but it's not completely without downsides.\n\nFor one, it's not quite clear how it would play out in the courts or the timeline that would ensue. Additionally, it might spook bondholders and throw markets into tumult (moreso than actually breaching the debt limit).\n\nI'm not exactly opposed to it, but I think legislative brinksmanship (and the inevitable market pressure on the GOP) should be exhausted before those measures start being considered.Most of the big stuff happened when dems controlled the house and had the tiebreak majority in the senate, through a process called reconciliation, which can only be used a few times each session, and only for certain budget-related bills: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation\\_(United\\_States\\_Congress)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_(United_States_Congress))  \n\n\nThis process bypasses the Senate's 60-vote filibuster cloture rule, but requires the cooperation of both houses of Congress. Since the GOP controls the House of Representatives, there must be bipartisan agreement or compromise to pass anything.Reconciliation only requires 50. That's what was used to pass the IRA and American Rescue Plan and other things. It could be a theoretical way to raise the debt ceiling, but opens a can of worms by inviting a host of negotiations, and would still need to survive the House.\n\nTo remove the debt ceiling altogether, that requires 60 votes or removal/modification of the filibuster. Something that wasn't going to happen last Congressional term, and certainly won't happen now that the GOP controls the House.That does sound nice, wish we could have nice thingsbut it is about paying the debt, because given our budget we *have* to keep borrowing to service the debt we already have. If we stop we default. Congresses problem is we have the **Republicans** who aren't really serious about taking the steps to actually do anything about it. They are the ones who love it because they keep using it to push political agenda.China pays less for military because they control the price.How optimistic of you\u2026Yeah he doesn\u2019t want a 100% voting with Biden recordNegotiating over the debt ceiling is insane. Especially with McConnell, who has previously referred to the debt ceiling as a \"hostage that's worth ransoming.\" You don't negotiate with terrorists, because giving them what they want will only encourage more hostage-taking.The GOP for 50 years: Take it out of the poorest peoples' pocket.Exactly, wait until their loud-mouth constituents stop receiving their checks along with everyone else. I don\u2019t think they even fathom what disaster a default would produce.There is nothing to offer. You negotiate when you are doing the budget. Jesus Christ the hypocrisy is sickening. Do people not understand the debt ceiling crap is just complete bs.\nMaybe Dems should just never raise the debt ceiling under a Republican again. Just f them..Why are Republicans fighting to not raise the debt ceiling now, when a Democratic president is in office, but they didnt fight to not raise the debt ceiling when Trump was in office, and raised it three times under Trump?\n\nAnd have raised the debt ceiling twice as often under Republican presidents, than during Democratic administrations?\n\nIt just seems like very poor, very obvious, very ineffective gamesmanship from Republicans, if they cant explain why.\n\nShit, Cucky Kevin probably cant pass _his own bill_ in _his own chamber_He refused because Republicans don\u2019t negotiate in good faith.Your characterization is simply not true. \n\nThe deficit is the responsibility of the United States government, accumulated over decades. It\u2019s the responsibility of both parties.\n\nNegotiation occurs when spending is passed.  \n\nNot paying Capital One because you regret your overspending during your Las Vegas vacay last month is stupid and won\u2019t work.I mean, my taxes started going up in 2021, thanks to Trump who was out of office at the time, due to his tax bill he passed in 2017, so...Yes. \n\nRepublicans are playing a shitty, transparent, naked power game. They are refusing to do now, what they did 3 times under Trump with no strings attached.\n\nAnd they can't explain why, because they're so full of shit, their eyes are brown.Yes, because placing those limits violates the constitution as soon as those limits are exceeded. \n\nThe debt limit prevents the Treasury from servicing the debts it already has, and prevents it from going into debt to cover spending that was already mandated by Congress. Both of those things put the full faith and validity of the debt into question, thus violating the constitution. While the Treasury has the option of just printing a shitload of money and ushering in runaway inflation, that would also destroy the validity of US debt by severely and intentionally devaluing those bonds, which is again unconstitutional. \n\nFaced with following an arbitrary  rule or the constitution, the president has no choice but to ignore the arbitrary rule. And even as extreme as SCOTUS has become, I don't see five votes to literally kill the US economy and usher in a great depression.There's a utilitarian argument that while his pedophilia did more harm on an individual basis, the total amount of harm caused by the Hastert rule vastly overshadows it.It means we have to pay debts and interest on debts, among other things. Congress doesn\u2019t just authorize spending, they make it law. President is legally bound to spend as congress directs. Debt ceiling directly contradicts that.Well if anything voting against raising the debt ceiling would be questioning the debt. In any case though I would see the debt ceiling itself as unconstitutional. Basically the equivalent of a law getting struck shed by the Supreme Court[deleted]Which part is unprecedented? Schumer tried to do the exact same thing in 2017It's terrorist negotiations round after round\n\nRepublicans said do it our way or we blow up the economy, moodys cited them as a reason why the usa credit was downgraded.\n\nThey got their way, now they're using the same playbook but going for more.\n\nThey will continue to threaten the life of the hostages round after round and try to play the other person as responsible to try and stop them. They're never responsible for their actions. How could you let them do that?\n\nCaving to their demands with them holding a gun to the head of the economy only encourages this brinksmanship.\n\nAt what point do we break the cycle of Republicans taking us to a cliff and threatening to drive off unless they extort a wish list of demands from the passengers?\n\nI'm so tired of the Republicans fucking up on purpose in pursuit of political powerIf Democrats cave and agree to massive cuts to medicaid and SNAP I will never vote for another Democrat againRemind me which party causes the explosion in debt, every time they are in control?\n\nSo they get to spend out of control when they\u2019re in office, but when they aren\u2019t it\u2019s all \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201dThats not what it is at all but go off. The debt ceiling is a separate issue.  The fact remains is the republicans had no qualms with zero string debt ceilings when their guy was in office. As I said, fair is fair. Reconciling can take place during the full budget bill process. Your comment literally added nothing.Huh? It's the debt limit..not the time for poison pills. Do you even hear yourself? Notice how they aren't slashing the military. All their talk about cutting spending is beyond laughable if they don't touch the one bloated budget that could we could afford to cut in half and still spend 2x as much a China on defense.Pass a clean bill like they did under Trump (while adding 7T to the debt) and negotiate your cuts in the Budget where they belong.  Don\u2019t threaten the economy you care so much about for political gamesmanship.\u201cA strange game. The only winning move is not to play.\u201dThey raised the budget to pay for more shit under Trump. The Democrats also never threatened to default because they knew what a stupid fucking move that'd be.They should not be concerns, but they are. A single mother working and caring for her family does not have time to file a DOL claim when her place of employment claims she worked 19 hours one week because she had to leave early to pick up her sick child at school and now she has to choose who eats this week.\n\nA young woman shouldn't have to file a DOL claim because her minimum wage employer is asking for explicit favors or else her gubmnt check isn't coming this week. She should just walk away, but she can't, because the government isn't on her side... its on his. Better work with him or no assistance for you.\n\nThe government and its assistance isn't only for those who can afford (Time or Money) lawyers. it is for everyone. Every barrier is a stick that someone can use on someone else.> It also does not matter what they get paid. It could be minimum wage, but it is irrelevant because it is something rather than nothing.\n\nTranslation: \"Fuck them poors\"Man neoliberals with their means testing are the worst.Yes, medicare/medicaid is healthcare.The GOP has chosen violence, and until they see meaningful consequences for the chaos they're sowing, it won't end.Until these MAGA clowns are gone unfortunately it is the new normal. The GOP has been playing this game of chicken with the debt ceiling for decades, but this time around with McCarthy bowing to these MAGA twits we have a real issue..... the MAGA rather see the world burn than back downThat's another option.  But I think that citing the Constitution would be better from a PR standpoint than minting the coin.True.  But it might work out.  Gorsuch is super literal about interpreting these things, Roberts won't want his legacy to be global economic collapse, and the people who paid off Kavanaugh's debts probably don't want default either.This is the smart move.\n\nRight now, Biden is facing a choice between default and caving to the Republican agenda -- not a great decision. If he invokes the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court will be facing a choice between default and solvency, period. It's a much simpler scenario.\n\nI've been waiting for 20 years for the Democrats to show some spine in invoking Constitutional authority. I was disappointed as hell that Obama didn't simply announce that he was seating Garland after the Senate refused to hold a confirmation vote. If Biden passes on this opportunity to defang economic terrorism once and for all, I have no idea what the hell they're doing.We could also just disregard SCOTUS if it comes to that.Government shutdown isn't an option here iirc. This is about whether we pay the bills we have already racked up, not about funding the government. If we don't raise the debt ceiling we will continue to fund the government, we just won't pay back any of the money we borrowed to do it, which will crash the US credit score.> I don't see that happening before 2 weeks of government shutdown\n\nAt this point, if there's a shutdown, it will only be because we have defaulted.At least she still gets to vote. Gross that she's being censured for existing.OP doesn\u2019t understand this nuance\u2026I'm not an economist, but what I'm saying is that AFAIK at an arbitrarily high point of debt-financed spending, you begin to cause stuff like hyperinflation.  You do need continued, tangible economic growth to keep perpetual deficit spending sustainable.What I think will happen:\n\n1. An 11th hour \"agreement\" is reached a la 2011\n2. Biden sues to suspend the debt limit in court before a default happens\n3. Biden executes the 14th amendment declaring the debt ceiling unconstitutional and the Republicans sue to overturn that decision.\n\nThe amount of money companies would lose due to the economy crashing from a default is something the Republicans would never live down.Exactly. Dems could have taken care of debt ceiling in  2021. And some of them introduced the necessary bills. But leadership was not on board...I'm super confused by this comment, could you explain more?I agree. In fact, I would be very happy if Biden came out and stated very clearly that the only debt ceiling bill he will sign is a clean debt ceiling bill. Still, it's looking more and more likely the Senate will hand McConnell leverage on the issueYet the current budget is under Joe Biden (Democrat Control).  Has been under 2021, 2022, and now 2023.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou own the current budget issue! Joe Biden is the issue.  I did not vote for the demented fool.  Did you?Thanks for a 'No reply!!/  Dems have such a presence in Congress yet NOT ONE offer to address this issue!They don't? What is your proof?  Joe keeps promising so much to so many.  Does not keep the debt ceiling in question.  Joe has been in office for 2021, 2022, and 2023.   How is this issue not a 'Joe' issue?Please explain.  How did your personal tax bills go up, when personal taxes were reduced?The constitution also places the power to create those bonds in the first place on Congress. The literal argument is that Congress delegating that power to a limited extent is unconstitutional and instead that power remains delegated but in an unlimited fashion?  Why wouldn't the result instead be that Congress now has to pass bonds to make up the shortfall themselves (aka since they don't lose the delegated power and it must be done but can't be done by the party it's been delegated to, it's their responsibility again)?\n\nI can see any decision based on this having some pretty far reaching consequences.Their offer is not in good faith. It isn't an attempt in the slightest.When trump wanted to eliminate the debt ceiling? Is that the same thing?Failing to respond to my comment so you want to redirect?\n\nMy comments have been purely from a place of \u201chistorically this isn\u2019t something that is negotiated around and it wasn\u2019t under the last potus\u201d\n\nYes it absolutely was negotiated.You are totally missing what the context previously was.\n\nDems didn\u2019t want a stand alone debt ceiling. The debt ceiling was passed because there was a handshake agreement on the spending package. If there was no agreement on the spending package, Dems would absolutely not have passed the debt ceiling.  Nancy wouldn\u2019t have even brought it to the floor until the agreement was in place. The GOP did not want to increase total spending at all.. they would have much rather taken from entitlements to pay for the increase in defense, but they found the middle ground increased the total spending without the cuts that the Dems didn\u2019t want to give up. Dems didn\u2019t want more spending on defense but also didn\u2019t want to cut entitlements but wouldn\u2019t have gotten gop buy in for debt ceiling without defense spending. Once that arrangement was agreed to\u2026 the debt ceiling was passed with no qualms. But they didn\u2019t get to no qualms UNTIL the negotiations on spending occurred.Democrats wanted to raise the debt under Trump because it benefitted them. Who was constantly calling for more stimulus for months? Who was promising enhanced unemployment benefits? Who wanted to add more child tax credits? Who wrote the bills for that? They were not holding the deficit hostage because they wanted their spending included in it.What\u2019s the backing of your claim of \u201cnever threatened to default\u201d\n\nIf this was true\u2026 the GOP could have just approached it as sky\u2019s the limit with their demands and you\u2019re suggesting the Democrats historically would have accepted it? Get out of here.\n\nNot meeting the minimum requirements of Dems in a deal is the threat to default. Stop with the talking points.Yeah but then if violence happens to them, they crank up the \"I'm a victim and it's _________s (brown/black/gay/trans/Democrat/Jewish or whatever flavor of hate for the month it is) fault\", and then they proceed to rile and rally their base up to more violence. \n\nMost recently it just takes knocking on the wrong door and they're \"afraid for their life\" so they just open fire. \n\nIt won't end. It just propagates more violence.I just read it the way they read the 2nd amendment. \n\n\"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law [...] shall not be questioned.\"> Exactly. Dems could have taken care of debt ceiling in 2021.\n\nThe reconciliation process would not allow for removal of the debt ceiling.China sets their prices and workers get paid less than US does for their military. It\u2019s easier for China to pay less when they can pay pennies for everything.Republicans control the House, and it is the House's resonsibility to pass a budget.\n\nIt can then be negotiated. After Republicans pass one, as is their responsibility. \n\nWho controls the House right now, in your opinion?Dems do not have control of the House, which is _where this shitshow is taking place_\n\nIt is first up to Cucky Kevin and the other Crypublicans, to agree _amongst themselves_ on a deal (then negotiations can _start_). And Republicans dont appear capable of even doing _that_.\n\nYou didnt answer my question, im going to guess intentionally (because you cant):\n\nWhy are Republicans fighting to not raise the debt ceiling now, when a Democratic president is in office, but they didnt fight to not raise the debt ceiling when Trump was in office, and raised it three times under Trump?Who controls the House of Representatives, which is the body responsible for passing a budget bill?What\u2019s my proof? The fact that it took McCarthy months to get a bill together and when he finally did it was full of absolute BS non-starters.Trumps tax plan was designed such that increases on the middle class would begin in 2021, after he was out of office, so it wouldnt make him look bad.How do you know?The debt ceiling was passed three times under Trump\u2026CLEAN. Literally every debt ceiling crisis since \u201895 (meaning then and 2011, 2013, now) has been when the republicans politicized it because their guy was not in office. It was made clear before McCarthy was even elected speaker that it needs to pass clean but negotiations were welcome on the budget because the ceiling is needed to pay for whats already in the current budget too. \n\nAll you are doing is trying miserably to parrot a weak talking point of not negotiating on that topic when Dems never threatened default during Trumps time. While also using speculative reasons. Fact remains, again, every debt ceiling \u201ccrisis\u201d was Republican congress and Dem POTUS. Its congresses job to pass it.What point are you even trying to convey here?Bro... there has literally been a clean bill and passed by both parties the last 80 years.  This is the first time in history a party has played with it like this.  This is economic terrorism.I'm not suggesting violence. I'm suggesting that law enforcement enforce the damn laws.Why not?You can't just make economics work by magic through decrees. If China doesn't pay enough for aeronautical engineers, then enough skilled people won't join the workforce, instead preferring to work in the civilian aeronautics scene (or even just Boeing or Airbus) hampering China's fighter engine development. Military development isn't coal mining.\n\nAmerica, by contrast, gets less price for many of their top of the line goods like fighters jets because it gets exported. US has about 450 F-35 fighter jets, similar amount was exported overseas to allies. This lowers per unit cost through economies of scale as fixed costs like initial R&D, facility construction gets spread over more sales. China has not exported a single of their top of the line J-20 fighter jet.In 2018, the Military paid 146 Billion to Personal. https://csbaonline.org/reports/military-personnelMan, thank you for this comment thread, because engaging with it to this point without blowing a blood vessel must have been a heroic act but reading it has been fun.\n\nThe blatant bad faith from the other guy, jfc, it's hilarious.Yet please post a cite? Even one?  Trumps tax reductions helped millions!Everything they have put forward has been laughable at surface level. It's been a pathetic attempt that is insulting.\n\nDo you think their plan is in good faith?Define clean\u2026 are you trying to say as a stand alone package?\n\nDo you understand how politics in Washington is done? You vote for my thing and I\u2019ll vote for yours? If you don\u2019t then I won\u2019t for yours\u2026 sure it\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d that they aren\u2019t linked in legislation.. but it\u2019s certainly not politically clean.\n\nRecently they didn\u2019t have to threaten anything\u2026 pelosi owned the floor and could silently choose if/when to bring the debt ceiling to the floor.\n\nJust like now the gop isn\u2019t threatening to default.. they just passed a bill that would raise it. If you want to be pedantic I can too\u2026 gop has recently voted to raise it\u2026 we will see who keeps not approving it.You said democrats raised the debt limit without conditions. I pointed out that they did so because they were benefitting from raising it. If they weren't benefitting, they easily could have held the debt limit hostage to reverse Trump's tax cuts. However that did not matter as much as the $5 trillion in benefits spending they passed for COVID. It would have been idiotic for them to cut off their nose just to stick it to Trump.The GOP will do this stunt and then wonder why China's economic influence increases in the world...they will of course blame democratsOne, that's nearly impossible given our political climate. And two, they'll only break if broken. We can't reason with them despite our exhaustive efforts. I don't like it either but it is what it is.Because of how the rules of the reconciliation process work.  The can't just pass whatever they want.\n\nIf they wanted to remove the debt ceiling, it needs to go through like a regular bill on Capitol Hill.  Make sure to vote out any of your Republican representation next fall.You would not believe how many resort to blocking me, or deleting their account outright, when they cant answer simple repeated questions.\n\nI was even called a domestic abuser by one, because I \"sounded like one\" when i said \"people who have $80,000 wont be affected by a $40/month increase to a bill\"\n\nIts fun!\n\nIts especially easy when you know that neither me (nor them) are actually attempting to change each other's opinion, and its all a performative house of cards that tumbles down when they cant dictate the discussion and follow their script.\n\nIts fun to display that for viewers like you :D (readers, i know, i just wanted to say the PBS thing)https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/opinion/republicans-biden-taxes.html\n\nNot a problem. Now here's where you complain about the NY Times being a biased, anti-trump source :DI have no reason to believe their plan is in bad faith. It\u2019s estimated to raise around $4.5 trillion and limits discretionary spending moving forward. Why do you think it\u2019s in bad faith?Except the only party that has ever held the debt ceiling hostage has been the Republicans.  And only when a Democrat is President.\n\nAlso, the Democrats control the Senate and the White House.  The Republicans barely hold the House.  Why should the Democrats capitulate?Democrats in congress are not morons who would hold the economy hostage . Explain to me what the worry about increasing the debt limit is? If republicans were ideologically consistent and actually cared about spending or whatever, they would have blocked those programs that you speak of, under Trump.  So thank you for proving that the GOP is only doing this for some perceived electoral gain. They are hacks.Not this time.  Everyone is taking notice.  Including big business and everyone holding 401ks.Dems were not able to abolish it under reconciliation, but they could have raised it:\n\n\"under the rules of budget reconciliation the only change that can be made to the debt ceiling is to raise it\" ([source](https://www.epi.org/blog/abolish-the-debt-ceiling-before-it-commits-austerity-again-the-gop-used-the-debt-ceiling-to-force-spending-cuts-in-2011-it-cant-be-allowed-again/) Economic Policy Institute)\n\nSo (A) the current \"crisis\" could have been averted... but wasn't. And (B) Biden himself is [against abolishing it](https://rollcall.com/2022/10/21/biden-dismisses-calls-for-abolishing-debt-limit/).\n\nThese two facts tell me that Dem leadership actually supports the ceiling, probably because it is a backdoor route to spending cuts that wealthy donors insist on. What other explanation is there?\n\nEDIT to add that Biden himself could have acted without Congress: \"If Congress won\u2019t act sensibly, the Biden administration should act unilaterally. There is plenty of support for citing the fact that Congress has given the executive branch conflicting instructions and, hence, the administration is free to choose which path it follows. Congress\u2019s taxing and spending instructions require the administration to issue debt to cover the shortfall, yet the debt ceiling would bar debt issuance. One of these congressional \u201cdecisions\u201d must be ignored, so the administration should decide. A more fun solution\u2014one that highlights the stupidity of the debt ceiling\u2014is minting the trillion-dollar platinum coin. I\u2019m a fan, mostly because of the educational value of it, and because it treats the debt ceiling as a problem with the contempt it deserves.\" (from EPI report above)That's an inventive way to describe deep partisan cuts and changes being forced through brinksmanship.",

Zooey Zephyr was sworn in just three months ago after winning a Missoula-based seat in November. GOP leaders have refused to recognize her in floor debates until she apologizes for the comment. \n\nOn Monday, supporters rallied on the steps of the state Capitol, and chants of \u201cLet her speak!\u201d shut down proceedings in the House for nearly a half-hour, as Zephyr hoisted her microphone above her head. \n\nOn Tuesday, Zephyr  tweeted a letter she received from leaders in the Republican-controlled chamber declaring their intention to bring a motion \u201cwith respect to the conduct of Representative Zooey Zephyr.\u201d \n\n\u201cI have been informed that during tomorrow\u2019s floor session there will be a motion to either censure or expel me,\u201d Zephyr said in a Tuesday tweet. \n\nLink to the full article: [https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3wvzb/montana-republicans-zooey-zephyr-expulsion](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3wvzb/montana-republicans-zooey-zephyr-expulsion)It's been pretty obvious for a long time that conservatives are finished with democracy.\n\nAsk them:  \"Why is it okay to deny representation to the people who voted for this legislator?\"\n\nSame shit that happened in Tennessee.  Who the fuck to they think they are?  This person *was elected by the people in her district*.  She should be participating in the debate.Why are Republicans such universal scum?This has been so rage inducing. \n\nThey wouldn\u2019t treat a GOP member like this or a white male democrat this way right off the bat. \n\nThis is pointed and discriminatory. Nothing she said or did merits this action. It is solely because she is trans and challenged the GOP to use empathy over a culture war.It didn't work out so well in Tennessee.they *want* trans kids to kill themselves, they just don't want people saying it outloudRepublicans sure do hate democratically elected officialsRepublicans are trying to erase LGBTQ+ people.A hate group is doing something motivated by hate. No way!She doesn't owe them an apology for speaking the truth. Trans kids are a vulnerable population already and the GOP is harming them more with barbaric laws. Sorry that the truth hurts their fragile fascist feelings but no one owes them shitNot happy we're in this spot as a country, but I'll at least be happy to see this backfire the way the TN expulsion did. \"You've energized voters against us.\" No shit Sherlock it's almost like we don't want to vote for senile old fascists!Didn't they learn anything from their debacle in Tennessee?She is a representative of the people who voted for her.  They are silencing all those people.Just a reminder that the governor of Montana once [assaulted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Gianforte#Election-eve_assault_on_journalist) a journalist just before a Congressional election in 2017. He faced stiff consequences.\n\nI'm kidding! He still got elected and a year later Trump congratulated him for it.While the word gets thrown around too much, expelling everyone with a different opinion sure sounds like something fascists would do.Republicans practice a really distorted version of ChristianityThis is how republicans behave with power.  Look at this.  Look at Florida.  Look at Tennessee.   \n Look at Texas.  They are not good caretakers of the government.  They are monstors  in hiding.Funny how conservative media isn't pushing this story.\n\nFunny how conservative media isn't pushing this story.\n\n***FUNNY HOW CONSERVATIVE MEDIA ISN'T PUSHING THIS STORY.***\n\nSunlight = the best disinfectant. They want this story to be kept in the dark.What are Zephyr\u2019s fellow Democrats in the legislator doing? Are they protesting this blatant attack on a party member. Or are they quiet?\"How dare you say we'll have blood on our hands if we pass this anti-trans bill. We love trans people SO much that we need you to stop talking until you apologize for saying that.\"Expelling legislators who were voted in by their constituents always works, never backfires, and leave your state in a better light than ever!  Just ask Tennessee.The right just keeps on punching downward. It used to be people of color and \u201cthe gays\u201d. Now, the right can\u2019t safely bully them without repercussions, so they found an even smaller, more marginalized group upon whom to take out their hatred and frustrations. I can only hope it backfires as spectacularly as the Tennessee expulsions did.Rep. Zephyr is frankly very brave trying to give trans Americans/Montanans a voice in government. I can't imagine how she must feel.Are there transcripts saved somewhere?  I have a hard time believing the phrase \u201cblood on your hands\u201d has never been uttered by her Republican counterparts during abortion debates the last few years.Republicans want thoughts and prayers for their hurt feelings while attempting trans genocide but will get none. I stand with the trans community.Zephyr does not owe the legislature an apology. The republicans do not believe the truth of the declaration, \"We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal.\" Nor do they seem to know that God refers to men and women collectively as men in Genesis 5:1-2' \"This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.\" Zephyr is correct because the republicans are intentionally causing a tremendous amount of pain and suffering to God's definition of Man.TN taught them nothing, eh? They're idiots.The next wave of stochastic terrorism in this country is going to be the assassination of elected officials. At the moment, there is still a mechanism by which representatives who are expelled from their representative bodies can be re-installed, but I suspect that \"loophole\" will soon be closed. It doesn't take an exhaustive look into world history to see what happens next to those the fascists want silenced.1. She's right\n2. Expulsion for doing her job sounds like a fascist move to me. It sure isn't democratic.\u201cLive and let live\u201d my assCan those weirdos find something else to do with their lives for once? Trans people are indeed that: people. Their very existence doesn't hurt anyone.For having what the audacity of exisiting? For being the voice of the people she represents?! That's her job, and it appears she does it well, representing the people.\n\nSo they're punishing her for what? Doing her job?God when exactly did trans people become the right wing boogeymen? Seriously it\u2019s getting old, why tf do they care so muchAs someone who has been living in missoula 8 years now I can't think of a better person than Zooey to represent us!  Fuck these regressive bigots trying to silence her.I hope republicans don\u2019t get re-elected when election comes around.Pretty sure this is stage 7 on the path to genocide.\n\n[10 Stages of Genocide at Genocide Watch](https://www.genocidewatch.com/tenstages)Does she have advocacy group or anything to help? Campaign team donation link? I'd love to be able to helpPeople might be ambiguous about or dislike trans because of lack of experience but most people do have experience with bullies and definitely don't like them.Doesn\u2019t work with black people anymore like in Tenn. now on to the next minority group to see if that worksIn the United States, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind. This is found in the Constitution under the first amendment.Don\u2019t worry about inflation and out mass shooting problem. We need to really focus on what\u2019s really important. /sHow very Democratic of them. I'm sure many idiots will defend this behavior but saying, \"we are a Republic\". Either way, this shit is unacceptable.Attention Republicans, Go Fuck Yourselves.Montana. The Y\u2019all Qaeda of Howdy ArabiaThey are flat out not even hiding how much they ignore the Constitution and Bill of Rights now.Subverting democracy because someone hurt your fee fees with the truth.\n\nIt's like they learned nothing from Tennessee.I'm a queer Montanan, is there any way that I can help support Zephyr? Like is there a place to donate, or any organizations, or protests, that kind of thing that somebody could direct me to? Fuck the gop in this stateHas the Southern Poverty Law Center named the GOP a hate group yet?There needs to federal repercussions for the GOP here. These little dollar store authoritarians are emboldened by their orange cult leader and people like DeFascist. Get some feds down there are nip this in the bud. This is some serious stuff.  Put a couple in prison to get the word out. Problem solved.At this point, keep at it. All they are doing is alienating independents more and more.Intelligent people scare themMy written response to the letter she got if it was me would habv been:\n\n\"Go fuck yourselves\"Once again, the GOP deciding to make states into I guess \"fortresses of consolidated power and whiteness\", taking the wrong lessons from Tennessee without paying attention to the Streisand effect there (as mentioned in the article, Jones and Pearson became more nationally famous), etc. So much to go into here, such as the efforts to silence and wipe out trans people escalating again (this morning saw a tweet from a Jake Shields who asked if people would support public executions of anyone who helped a child transition, stating \"things are being pushed to such an extreme that the cure is likely to be just as extreme\" with  the blue checks replying \"yes\"), and the anti-democracy angles, since well they're basically looking to get rid of anyone who is even slightly out of line with \"this is a White, Christian, straight\" etc. thing. And how many others will be expelled in other GOP-led state legislatures, how many of them will ignore the blowback building up to push these schemes?It would be so great for Americans if they focused on improving people\u2019s lives instead.Didn\u2019t Tennessee just try this? And failed?.... because that works so well when you do that.  (Its literally like watching children on a playground making rules up as they go along.....)The people elected the Legislator. Let them serve.Republicans want everyone to have rotting primitive brains that can't accept new information just like their own.I don\u2019t understand how you expel someone who was elected by the people.  WTF\"If you use decorum to silence people who hold you accountable, all you are doing is using decorum as a tool of oppression,\" Zephyr added.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/04/26/1172158461/montana-gop-transgender-zooey-zephyr-punishment-banned-speaking-lgbtqRepublicans are amazing at taking a states issue to a national level and garnering support for democrats throughout the entire country. Let them keep doing it. It'll get rid of gop faster.I have family from CA that moved to Montana. They\u2019re the openly racist qanon guzzling Bakersfielder type of Californian. You are welcome Montana.Typical republican move. Oust an elected official because they don\u2019t conform to your ideals. I hope they look at Tennessee and learn but of course they won\u2019t.So fascist then? Why do liberals refuse to call conservatives fascist?Looks like the Montana GOP is is the fuck around phase of finding out.Of course they are. They can't win, so cheat.Republicans treating transgender people like they are illegal or lesser than the rest of us is similar to the way indigenous or black peoples have been treated.Can\u2019t wait for reporters to dig up dirt on the GOP representatives there\u201cLove thy neighbor.\u201d Uh huh, stop pretending to be holy and loving of the Bible, bunch of hypocrites.Sounds like a possible violation of human rights to me.Hopefully this backfires, like in Tennessee.How the fuck do you sit there and watch what happened in TN, and think to yourself \u201cYou know, more of this will definitely help us.\u201dthe federal government is not going to save us. start dismantling your authoritarian state legislatures. dissolve them and start overGood for her.  Stand your ground and face them down.She was voted in fair and square. She\u2019s just trying to do her job well. It\u2019s none of their business.Snowflakes can only dish it out and melt when challenged[removed]Do it, you're not going to listen to her anyways. Give her a national platform and national attention to your actions and decisions and see how it goesThe Bullies' Rights Movement is alive and well.People fear what they don't understand.  And because it goes against their \"religion\" they don't WANT to understand.  They want every member of society to fit into the neat little box they've given them, and anyone that doesn't assimilate they shame, shun, or ban.  Their minds and their hearts are welded closed to anyone who is or thinks or believes \"different\"  than they do.  \n\n  \nYou can't teach someone who isn't willing to learn.  The only solution is to turn the tables so THEY become the minority with no power or influence.  Then society can leave them behind and in the pages of history where they belong.So did they not learn anything from the Tenn 3? All this will do is give her a huge platform and piss off normal people.  It\u2019s like they want to throw away 2024 before it even startsI'm surprised the GOP wasn't invited to the Player Haters' Ball, their motto is exactly what Silky Johnson said:\n\n\"I hate you. I hate you. I don't even know you, and I hate your guts. I hope all the bad things in life happen to you and nobody else but you.\"Republicans defying the will of the people? Not surprising.And now they have silenced her at the same time as discussion over the republican spending bill. Wonder why.Didn't learn their lesson from Tennessee, I see.Look at how desperate Republicans have become lmfao.The #GOP playbook in a nutshell: \u201cthe end justifies the means\u201d and everything in the way is acceptable collateral damage.\"The will of the people\" unless I dont like what the people want.The republicans are actively destroying \u201cwe, the people\u2026\u201d for their own sick, selfish agenda.And these people demand we stop calling them fascists when we demand, more importantly, that they stop being fascistsOf course they are. They are intolerant garbage humans that don\u2019t deserve the position they have. Hate filled trashWell here... National Boycott on beef until they knock it off and let her speak. Let the Cattlemen's Assoc. (which likely many if not all are members) sort it out.so how republicans are not definition of nazis ?even Jesus would never forgive what they do\n\n>Let me ask you one question  \n>  \n>Is your money that good?  \n>  \n>Will it buy you forgiveness?  \n>  \n>Do you think that it could?  \n>  \n>I think you will find  \n>  \n>When your death takes its toll  \n>  \n>All the money you made  \n>  \n>Will never buy back your soul  \n>  \n>And I hope that you die  \n>  \n>And your death will come soon  \n>  \n>I will follow your casket  \n>  \n>By the pale afternoon  \n>  \n>And I'll watch while you're lowered  \n>  \n>Down to your deathbed  \n>  \n>And I'll stand over your grave  \n>  \n>'Til I'm sure that you're deadBecause that worked out so well for them in TennesseeI honestly would like to see some these idiotic Republicans get expelled from office permanently for their actions and their crimes against transgender people. All across America.If these people want to run their state in their own way, they are MORRRRRRREEE than freaking happy to forgo any federal funds. Hell secede. Whatever. \n\nI personally would be more than fine seeing the entire American heartland leave. Let them enjoy life being a land locked country aside from the Gulf of Mexico. And frankly, Louisiana's legislators likely aren't actually stupid enough to go along with all this.\n\nHave fun with your imports and exports. Have fun having any airspace and be left begging Mexico and Canada for access to fly planes in and out of your country.\n\nHave fun paying for environmental disasters when your stuck with Wyoming and North Dakota for  your new federal funding after losing all money from those evil liberal coastal states.\n\nPlease.. leave. Very few actual people who like democracy would care.How much hatred and uselessness can a person have?\"Both sides.....\".Republicans: Never, ever, not interested in what\u2019s in someone else\u2019s pants.*\n\n*especially if it\u2019s a kidlol republicans are such dumbasses. They just watched this fail spectacularly in Tennessee and learned nothing.Republicans are digging their own graveRepublican rigged decorum demands insurgent response.What\u2019s their exact reasoning for doing this other than the legislator\u2019s identity?Are these Republican lawmakers actual morons or are they just playing one on tv?If only she was a Supreme Court judge taking bribes\u2026.\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fThat picture looks like she\u2019s casting a spellAcme dynamite kit.Love the pic that makes her look like a powerful wizardthese villains just keep doing the Streisand effect \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts like they don't seem to grasp how bad this makes them look to the average americanTheir blood is on Ranrok\u2019s hands![deleted]GQP asshats being asshats? I\u2019m shocked!Such fucking snowflakesThey never learn. This woman is just trying to expose how republicans are going to kill children with their bigoted legislation.\n\nThey're going to make her their states most acclaimed politician.WeRE tHE fREEdoM ParTY of LImiTEd GoVTGOP  \nGenital Obsessed PartyRepublican snowflakes. Extreme retribution against someone who voices criticism. You're all in politics. A big part of that is debating legislation. These Republicans wouldn't last a minute in the UK parliament which I'd say can get pretty heated in their arguments. But, that's a part of politics. What Montana and TN are doing is just undemocratic.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough for them to get the harmful bills through,\u201d Zephyr told reporters Monday. \u201cWhen someone stands up and calls out their bills for the harm they cause, for the deaths they cause, they want silence. And we will not be complicit in our eradication.\u201dHey, idiots!  Can you say Tennessee? You know, the Streisand effect?Republicans will not let the will of the voters interfere with their agenda of hate.I don't think the party that champions that an invisible sky wizard should dictate our laws should also get to decide who is and isn't mentally fit to serve as a legislator.\n\nFrankly, their reasoning for hating trans people can be applied to their own beliefs just as accurately.For the crime of opposing the GOP's bigotryBut, but... FREEDUM!!!!\n\n(For me and not thee.)\n\nParent's Rights!!!!!!\n\n(For me and not thee.)\n\nSmall Government!!!!!\n\n(For me and not thee. I want to be able to tell you what you can do with your body, how to wear your hair, and what clothes to wear.)\n\nHypocrisy is their religion.I\u2019m wondering how unusual is the statement she made in the Montana house? Nobody has ever said something similar when debating abortion or another topic?Remember this vote when people say, \"both sides are the same,\" or that Democrats are just corporate shills.\n\nThere is a party actively trying to destroy Democracy in this country.  \nThere is a party actively targeting minorities in this country.  \nThere is a party actively limiting the rights of women in this country.  \nThere is a party actively limiting your right to vote in this country.\n\nAnd it is all the same party, punish them for a generation. There can be no coming back from this.This country is in regression, what little is left of our democracy is dying.We elect them then they expel them what kind of democracy is this?[The expulsion passed](https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/26/politics/montana-house-bans-zooey-zephyr/index.html).\n\nI hope she stands up and defies this and speaks anyway while bringing attention to this issue. She was democratically elected by the voters and it's vital that acts to silence dissent is quickly stomped out before it gets worse.Is this the type of democracy Republicans believe in Montana, and voters are letting them do it?Republicans don\u2019t want to listen to anyone\u2019s concerns. You might vote for them because they hurt the people you don\u2019t like, but they\u2019re going to hurt you too. They just want to rule over you.From the CNN article:\n\n>\u201cWhen I rose up and said there is blood on your hands, I was not being hyperbolic. I was speaking to the real consequences of the votes that we as legislators take in this body,\u201d [Rep. Zephyr] said.\n\n>\u201cAnd when the speaker asks me to apologize on behalf of decorum, what he is really asking me to do is be silent when my community is facing bills that get us killed. He\u2019s asking me to be complicit in this legislature\u2019s eradication of our community, and I refuse to do so and I will always refuse to do so.\u201d\n\nConservative \"thinkers\" always bring up the fact that trans people commit suicide at such a higher rate as some type of indictment of transgenderism. The reality is that their callous disregard for trans lives *drives* people to suicide. When someone has the gall to stand up for them, they're reprimanded.I dont even know what's going on in this country.  Republicans aren't even trying to hide it anymoreUhhh\u2026January 6th. If that whole situation wasn\u2019t a breach of \u201cdecorum\u201d then I guess decorum simply doesn\u2019t mean what I thought it meant. The very idea that these asshats just banned this Rep from speaking due to a breach of decorum makes me angry AF. These fuck nuggets actually believe that January 6th was nothing more than a slightly rowdy tour. But people actually protesting and not being violent is a breach of decorum. Fuck your decorum!Republicans just stopped trying to be a democracy cuz they lost onceOf course they are\u2026 similar tactics worked so well in Tennessee that the Montana republicans want to help ensuring Zooey Zephyr as the next person who is expelled and returned.  All they are doing is elevating her voice and showing the citizens of Montana and the country how bigoted and disgusting they are.\n\nThey\u2019ll try to window dress it in procedural bullshit, but everyone will see it exactly as it is.\n\nI strongly support the protestors at the state Capital and if it wasn\u2019t a nearly 3000 journey I\u2019d be there with them.  \n\nHer conduct has been in the highest tradition of a democracy\u2026 speaking up for the disenfranchised and the marginalized.  THIS IS THE WAYCaptain obvious says \"you know, I think it's possible those Montana republicans may just be to simple minded to evolve\"Glad I live in Missoula but ashamed of Montana right nowWe'll, ain't this something? The #GOP wants to control everything they can, and they are realizing that they can't. So what do they do? They take a play from their own playbook and run the dirty politics play. \n\nThe #GOP can't just let people live their lives anymore. If it's not THEIR way, then it's no way. They don't believe in compromise. They don't believe in having decent conversations. \n\nI guess we as a country will continue to go backwards until someone does something.  Something will have to give sometime.I've said it before and I'll say it again. There is no compromising with republicans.It\u2019s wild they try to lay the victim as usual and act Ike what this person is doing is wildly inappropriate, meanwhile we have dipshits in their own party talking about Jewish space lasers, and making mockeries of hearings by calling people liars and other bs.Doesn't Montana support gay marriage? How is this where they draw the line? So stupid.The gop is why we can\u2019t have nice things!!!At this point, I am supportive of eradicating the GOP as a legal functioning entity in this country. They have lost all legitimacy as a political party and anyone\u2026ANYONE\u2026supporting them is an enemy of humankind. They should be banned and any political movement trying to resurface their beliefs should lead to prosecution. Kick rocks to anyone who disagrees because we are approaching actual fascism in this nation tolerating them.They aren't trying, they have. The question is what is anyone going to do about it?Good this is wrong ! Good work \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffbSilencing her and expelling her for her speech violates the First Amendment.  No one wants to live in a country where the Government can silence it's citizens for their words, ideas or actions that do not impact others.  \n\nThe only legitimate role of a government interfering in the rights of its citizens is when the exercise of the rights of one citizen interferes with the exercise of the rights of another.  If her actions do not interfere with the rights of anyone else, then it's not the government's fucking business.  It is unconstitutional to silence her in this way.This is so wrong.  She was elected with over 70% of the vote in her district!  Trans rights are Human Rights!!Boy it must suck to have to be the spokesperson for a demographic and an icon for the oppressed. Trans people just want to be people, just live their lives like the rest of us.Christian hatred... Such an evil set of rules they want to live by. Hate hate hateThey are disenfranchising the voters in her district!The \u201cblood\u201d of the US Constitution will be on their hands now too.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/us/politics/stu-rasmussen-dead.html\n\nA small and conservative town in Oregon had a trans major years ago. The world didn\u2019t endI did Nazi that coming\u2026So the NAZI's are at it again. This country has gone down the crapper.Alright y\u2019all. Seriously, all she did was argue that legislatures would have \u201cblood on their hands,\u201d and then refused to apologize.\n\nThat\u2019s worth not allowing her to argue on the floor anymore? All she can do is vote?\n\nBut if she apologies - it\u2019s all good?\n\nBut much, y\u2019all.Gee... did she try to overthrow the government?Because Montana is a racist homophobic shithole. Don\u2019t let the slick advertising fool you. It\u2019s a backwater filled with scum.This is like a public lynchingWell that\u2019s not the way to do it.Everyone voting Republican in the next election needs to take a look in the mirror and decide if you're voting for fascism or not, because even if you're not trans, or gay, etc, it's only a matter of time before the coming for you nextHmmm something triggered them could it be because they do in fact have BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS?6 It's not legal they cannot do that if they do that then they have openly discriminated which is illegal under state law as well as federal lawOh no! Man this country is gonna fall into a third world country the way we keep going and people don't see itWhite men back on topI know this is a serious article, and it\u2019s a damn travesty what the Republicans are doing\u2026 But come on Vice, why did you choose a picture that makes it look like she\u2019s casting dark magic on the Republicans?That's what happens to people who suppress their gay tendencies, they have someone whipping them while they soil their diapers. When they finally reach the end of depravity they become Republicans.Sounds like they're following the rulesThey didn\u2019t teach me about any of this shit in political science classesSounds to me that some people need to go make some noise for the GOP members and see if they get censured too. \n\nSomehow I doubt it\u2026\u2026I love both the values from ether political side and hate the ugliness of both. However it\u2019s just the republicans that are just me feel ashamed because they backed a pretty bad president and are lingering for a hold somewhere.Of all the stock photos \u2018you\u2019 went with this one?I thought they barred the Legislator from the House floor. Can still vote remotely. Then would allow back into the house to take seat? \n\nSomething about House decorum and rules around actions/speech etc. \n\nI don't think any elected representative should be removed for their beliefs and should be allowed to speak/act as long as they follow the rules that are understood for the position.They will never take this person seriously. It\u2019s shame because she was voted into office. I\u2019m not a fan of the woke bullshit going on. But if you were voted in by the ppl then that\u2019s it. Your democracy manifest. You ate the voice of the constituents. To mute her is to go against the spirit of democracy itself.If you're not a republican, you're not a real person.So you think it's ok for an elected official to act in a manner unbecoming their position? This has absolutely nothing to do with gender, so playing the trans card won't get you anywhere. Act respectable and you'll be treated with respect. If you disagree on a piece of legislation VOTE, then move on. Instead of acting like a crybaby when it doesn't go your way.[removed]VICE twists the truth[removed]This won't bode well with them in a few hundred years when we have phasers and transporters.Vice can not respect the very person they are trying to defend.

So far they're targeting and expelling young black elected leaders, now a young elected trans leader. FL just legalized the seizure of LGBTQ children from their parents. \n\nFor all this talk of \"freedom\" some Americans claim to monopolize, there sure is a lot of support for flagrant authoritarianism in the land of the freeMf\u2019s will worship the American revolutionaries then proceed to summarily deny Americans political representation.The Republicans have put themselves in quite a quandary. If they see her as a man, the Constitution states all men are created equal so they cannot do anything because the majority of them are men. If they recognize her as female or even transgender, then they have just bucked their party and will likely get primaried. If they would have just shut up and left it alone, acting like real, adult, human beings, (like decent human beings) they might not have received the backlash they are receiving now and for the next few years. Didn't anyone tell them once you open up Pandora's box; you can't close it back up. You earned this boys. I hope Ms. Zephyr becomes 10x as powerful as you are now. She was already 4x since she is who she truly is, has likely researched the hell out of the topic (that means she has read a lot of books--not just with pictures) and likely Montana's and the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Constitution along with the Declaration of Independence and she is fighting accordingly, for all Montanans.

They may not like what she said by she has every right to say what she wants too.Do he do something to deserve it?Replace the word \"transgender\" with \"Jewish,\" and the GOP's actions are downright scary.Hopefully successfulRepublicans are probably worried there will be rioting after witnessing what happened in Tennessee less than a month ago.So this is their play now, huh? Just gonna expel anyone they can? All because someone hurt their fee-fees?Would be less than shocked if most of the republican Senate has not said something to the same effect about something since Obama was elected. Hell they all loved Trump and you could woupdnt be able to finish a book on all the enraging over the top things he continues to say.So let me get this straight.... Republicans want to expel a legally and democratically elected representative because they don't agree with what she's saying? and this coming from the party that loves to call people snowflakes. How is it legal for these people to remove someone that was elected by the people of the state? Similar thing with the legislators in Tennessee who wanted to propose legislation on gun reform. This seems like a calculated strategy in the GOP and I think we are going to be seeing a lot more of this where they try to silence other representatives they don't agree withSaying \"they'll have blood on their hands\" is a statement of fact given what the statistics tell us about trans youth.The house session is about to start now (3pm eastern/1pm mountain) and you can watch it here https://leg.mt.gov/audio-video/ I don't know how soon they will get to it or if they'll save it until the endOh you think we have blood on our hands? We'll show you we are right by stoping you from having a voice.We are now in a world where a transgender person dared to speak truth to power she is in danger of being expelled BUT all of the members of the Senate and House who peddled baseless conspiracy theories regarding the 2020 election and may have even helped coordinate the attack on the capital are in good standing. The GOP is rotten to the very core.Does vice News know if any republicans have ever used the phrase \u201cblood on your hands\u201d in relation to abortion legislation and what the actions there were?If they do expel her, is she likely to be returned to her seat via appointment like the Justins were until their special elections?\n\nAlso, in before we find out what rules those who are targeting her have been breaking for years, a la Cameron Sexton living in Nashville instead of Crossville and fraudulently charging for a long-distance commute.I've started asking MAGA family members something related to let them openly confirm their fascism. \"If the majority of voters in X state vote to approve Y policy you disagree with, should that policy be enacted?\" A person who was once left-leaning pre-FoxNews said \"No\" straight up. He no longer thinks America should be a democracy.>It\u2019s been pretty obvious for a long time that conservatives are finished with democracy.\n\nFinished? They never even started. The foundational text of conservatism, Burke\u2019s *Reflections on the Revolution in France* is an outright rejection of democracy. It argued that God had chosen certain people to lead, and blessed them with a noble title and/or wealth, because the rest of us weren\u2019t capable of running our own shit.\n\nSince 1790, the only thing that\u2019s changed is the branding.\"If you use decorum to silence people who hold you accountable, all you are doing is using decorum as a tool of oppression,\" Zephyr added.Because they literally created a culture to raise and nurture people into being scum. They are rotten to the very core of their being. It was ludicrous to ever believe there was a chance to compromise and work with them ever.They are, for all intents and purposes, the new Nazi party.Suppressed and unregulated/overly-regulated emotions, and an extremely narrow band of permissible personal self expression. \n\nThey are all in the closet\u2014not just a queer sexuality closet, that is exaggerated in these discussions and is ultimately a low key homophobic and flippant excuse. \n\nWhat I mean is they lock most of who they are away, push it down, choke it out. This happens when they are extremely young. Then they put on their conservative drag and are ultimately pretty dissatisfied with it, because it is joyless and boring; so, they then try to force everyone back into their same closet, so everyone is just as miserable as they are. \n\nThey want to make different people disappear because they need to think that all of the suppression and repression is somehow worth it and that they couldn\u2019t possibly be happier than they are, which is not at all.1. Psychological disorders: Certain psychological disorders, such as narcissistic personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder, can impair an individual's ability to feel empathy or concern for others. These disorders may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors, and can result in a lack of empathy and disregard for others' emotions and well-being.\n\n2. Childhood trauma or abuse: Experiencing traumatic events or abuse during childhood, such as neglect, violence, or emotional abuse, can negatively impact an individual's ability to develop empathy. Trauma can lead to emotional detachment and a defensive mechanism where the individual may shut off their emotions to protect themselves, resulting in a lack of empathy towards others.\n\n3. Environmental or cultural factors: The social and cultural environment in which a person grows up can also influence their ability to empathize with others. Factors such as being raised in an environment that promotes aggression, discrimination, or hostility towards others, or being exposed to chronic stress or violence, can shape an individual's beliefs and behaviors, leading to a lack of empathy.\n\n4. Learned behavior: Sometimes, individuals may learn to lack empathy through negative social conditioning or reinforcement. For example, if an individual has consistently been rewarded or reinforced for selfish or cruel behavior, they may develop a lack of empathy as they associate such behavior with positive outcomes or rewards.\n\n5. Brain abnormalities or dysfunction: Neurological conditions or brain abnormalities, such as traumatic brain injury, tumors, or other brain disorders, can impair areas of the brain responsible for empathy and social cognition. This can result in a reduced capacity for empathy and emotional understanding towards others.\n\n6.  They have tiny tallywackers and being an abhorrent douche nozzle is the only way they know to deal with the crippling insecurity of having such a tiny wang doodle.Well, a lot of it goes back to two big factors.\n\n1. At their core, their policies are hugely unpopular since they are intended to benefit the very few at the nation's expense.  So, if they run on policy, they lose in a democracy.  Period.\n2. When the Democrats took a stand for civil rights in the Civil Rights Era, and made it clear to the southern Dixiecrats (bigoted southern democrats) that they were going to have to toe the party line or GTFO, the GOP saw a way to lock in an entire region of blue-collar workers who would normally never vote for them.\n\nWith regards to #2, the Democrats were very aware of this consequence:\n\n>\u201cI said, \u2018Quite a day, Mr President.\u2019 As he reached a sheaf of the wire copy he tilted his head slightly back and held the copy up close to him so that he could read it, and said: \u2018Well, I think we may have lost the south for your lifetime \u2013 and mine.\u2019  \n>  \n>President Johnson, after signing the Civil Rights Act[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/22/we-may-have-lost-the-south-lbj-democrats-civil-rights-act-1964-bill-moyers](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/22/we-may-have-lost-the-south-lbj-democrats-civil-rights-act-1964-bill-moyers)\n\nThe GOP launched The Southern Strategy, which relied on racism as a selling point, to get southerners and conservatives elsewhere to vote for them despite the fact that they would be voting against their own interests.  It worked perfectly.\n\nThis is why #2 had such an impact.  It was an unexpected proof of concept and the GOP, having literally no other way to appeal to people they wanted to make dumber, poorer, and less politically powerful, went all-in on it.\n\nThe GOP then proceeded to basically industrialize this model, identifying, and propagandizing around one cultural issue after another, usually topics like abortion and immigration, but also returning to the generic model of targeting a vulnerable group, demonizing them, and frothing up the mob, encouraging attacks on them.  This has served them well as outright racism has gradually become more unacceptable in society before the Trump era, and so they shifted focus to gay and lesbian folks for a while, but then that became less acceptable in just a decade, so they pivoted most recently to trans folks.\n\nOf course, this has gradually rotted away at the moral and social fabric of the nation, having a major party turn itself into an engine of culture war against the nation's own people.  Now, they are expanding back into old territory, launching attacks on women, children, the elderly, all with the solid unflinching support of a voter base that has been conditioned over a lifetime to reward malice with gleeful support, even as the GOP hurts their voter's own interests.\n\nAs long as they can maintain the culture war spectacle, their voters turn a blind eye to the nation and their lives being torn down around them.\n\nAnd that's how they've become the party of universal scum.  Because there's a lot of people out there who don't give a shit about policy, principle, or anything other than that thrill of seeing a bully beat up someone small and throwing them a smile.  They'll vote that bully back into office time and again just to see them hurt the right people.Serious answer: [Watch this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs)\n\nBy being scum, Republicans harness the power of emotion, and thus have no need for policy or to pass economic benefits to their constituents. This lets them make off like the corrupt, greedy bandits they are.They are just riddled with hate. I would love for any republican to change my mind on that with proof. \n\nNot only that if they claim that they are not, why are they willing to associate themselves with the people in power who are filled with it?Strong emotional knee jerk reactions over decades create growth in the brain to have stronger reactions and craving for such strong emotions. Same thing with people trying to become london cabbies reading maps for about 3 years expanding spatial reasoning/memory regions.They are consumed by fear and hateBecause they don't want a democracy, they want power. Power over you and your life.Because they cannot compete on actual issues. Hate and bigotry are the ideas that keep their people voting.It is profitableIt\u2019s just a culture war at this point. It doesn\u2019t matter what makes sense or how wrong they are morally, Republicans just want to turn back the clock to a time where they understood the worldThey\u2019re just representing their voters. I do thank them for marking out the places I never want to visit.The better question is why so many people support that scum?She's literally the most qualified person in the room to speak on the bill. That's why they're silencing her. She spoke truth to power.Dude they\u2019re literally referring to her as \u201che\u201d even in their official governmental responses to her.  \n\nThese fuckers are goddamn orcs and every single one of them deserve to be cast to the street and forced to live the lives they\u2019ve made for their constituents.You one point wrong. They don\u2019t care about color, clarence thomas proofs it, they\u2019ll use anyone and thing to get what they want.Technically they *are* treating a white male Democrat like this. Male refers to sex not gender.Republicans: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.I work for a nonprofit that fought really hard for reps in TN. I\u2019m sad to say I\u2019m not seeing the same zeal for Rep. Zephyr. I can\u2019t imagine what the difference could be /s~~There is one difference between Montana and Tennessee worth noting. In Tennessee when there\u2019s a vacancy that would last more than a year the County gets to send a replacement, that\u2019s how the counties in TN were able to immediately reappoint the ousted reps to their seats pending the special election.~~\n\n~~In Montana, though, vacancies are only filled by special election. So if they oust this rep then that seat will stay vacant until that election happens. (Which she could probably get reelected in, of course, but meanwhile that district is short a representative.)~~\n\nI got this incorrect, I was looking solely at the Montana Constitution but they have statutes in place for the counties to fill vacancies.This is slightly different. In Tennessee, they went for full expulsion, which then opens the seat to be filled by either a special election, or in TN's case, the local governments. And those local governments filled those vacancies with the people removed because they could and they didn't do anything wrong in the first place.\n\nIn this case, they were for just censure, so Zephyr is still seated, but not allowed to be in the chambers or speak. I think she does get to vote from home for the rest of the legislative year. This means she can't just be restored by the community she represents.It's still way more acceptable to be transphobic than it is to be racist. This person is very unlikely to get the same support the two Justins got, though I of course hope I'm wrongJust like they really hate it when you call them racists because they enact racist policies.Democracy gets in the way of their plans*Eradicate*, they are trying to *eradicate* us.Yep. Making it legal to take trans children away from their parents\u2026 and then making it legal to give the death penalty to sexual predators\u2026 which is what they try to make them out to be. It\u2019s blatant.The G in GOP is Genocidewe'll never go away. The thing they forget. The straights, they make us. They keep making us.[removed]You know the answer to that.They're betting that Montana is different than Tennessee.  They might be right.  We'll find out soon.Learning is \"woke\", so they outright refuse to do it!I love in Missoula where she was elected. I voted for her and myself and a lot of our friends are just enraged by all this.\n\nI\u2019m glad to see that it\u2019s getting wider attention at leastBecause the GOP is full of authoritarian fascists.you mean the Republicans should have thrown stones at the trans legislator until they were dead?Not a peep in the conservative subStop abusing all caps.They are standing with her. They are also stating that this is a blatant attack on her. Many of them stood with her during the protest on Monday where supporters came to the capitol to demand they let her speak.This. Every Dem in that chamber should stand up and repeat her remarks. Let them expel the entire caucus.I didn't know they had more than two democrats in Montana /s\n\nETA the S cause I didn't think it needed it the first timeUhhh... They still like to go after POC - see Tennessee.> I have a hard time believing the phrase \u201cblood on your hands\u201d has never been uttered by her Republican counterparts during abortion debates the last few years.\n\nRights for me but not for thee...\n\nThis is the epitome of bigoted hypocrisy.Isaiah 1:15: When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.\n\nShe\u2019s just about quoting the Bible at these Nazis and they\u2019re offended.Oh please...Republicans sent a blood thirsty mob to the capitol to kill Mike Pence. This shit in Montana is pure woke virtue signaling to their intellectually lazy base.TN taught them they can try to expel democrats at the state level in every state. Thankfully they were reinstated there but republicans faced no consequences for trying and are showing they\u2019ll keep trying in other states now.That\u2019s my biggest fear for her right now.I know right?Because we\u2019re such a small minority that we can easily be silenced and exterminated for political points. The GOP\u2019s platform is using hate to obfuscate how little they\u2019re doing to help their constituency. \n\nIt\u2019s also a great smokescreen for all the steps they\u2019re taking to rewrite the rules and entrench themselves as the sole political power. Then they\u2019ll expand their genocide to encompass all queer people, not just trans folks.Is it not 8?  I feel like we\u2019re in 8 already.Fuck the gop in every stateYou are right, friend. This is the answer!Feds don't have jurisdiction over a state house determining their memebers.\n\nThere are not federal laws about the rules of decorum in a state government.\n\nThis is not to say this isn't ridiculous bullshit, but there really isn't a federal power I'm aware of to leverage here.\u201cThrow our political opponents in prison!\u201d\nHm.Can confirm\u2026been trending that way for quite some time.bigots gonna bigotPeople in Montana complain non stop about \"Californians coming here and bringing their politics with them.\" Not once do they realize that the influx of people like your folks is what turned a purple state into a red state.I hope they don't and show us their colors, They keep kicking out elected officials that clearly are not part of their purity. Show the country what gross terrible fucks they are.Cute take, but the fascists are the bad guys.The last sentence seems to go over everyone\u2019s heads. Parents that allow their kids to transition before they are adults are the monsters. But people hear anti-trans and forget how to think critically. They aren\u2019t banning transitions, they\u2019re just making it to where the adult making the decision is the one putting their health at risk.Because it\u2019s a synonym\u2026different words, same meaningBob Dylan[removed]As our republican neighbors are fond of saying, this is (D)ifferent...They did expel her today..Republicans love this one secret trick..She's been basically ousted on an existameanor... Nothing pisses republicans off more than a trans woman (except maybe women... or a minority with power... or any minority... or education...)>and should be allowed to speak/act as long as they follow the rules that are understood for the position.\n\nFor clarity here, she did not break the rules, they are only pretending she did. She correctly, and with a completely appropriate level of emotion, pointed out that banning gender-affirming care will lead to more dead transgender people. She used the very common idiom, \"you will have blood on your hands.\"\n\nI can't imagine anybody acting in good faith could call that a breach of house decorum of the kind that merits censure. We should expect our elected representatives to passionately speak about the issues that affect their constituents, especially when proposed laws will cost lives and do harm. They demanded an apology from her, and she rightfully refused. She deserves nothing but full and enthusiastic support.Define woke.>I\u2019m not a fan of the woke bullshit going on.\n\nWhat would that be?Woke is apparently any American being allowed to run for office? You realize the context here is REPUBLICANS passing bigoted legislature right? She wasn't trying to pass anything.A trans person existing is not \"woke bullshit\"\"woke bullshit?\"\n\nWhat does the word \"woke\" mean?> He got a dick?\n\nYou got a high school education?Look mom, a bigot.Her, and no - she's violated no laws and is being kept from expressing the will of their constituents. This is fascism.Doesn't she say she is trans?What does this have to do with an adult being silenced from doing their elected job?You shouldn\u2019t voice your opinions on medical treatments your don\u2019t understand and this is 100% an instance of that.The vast majority of transgender people never get surgery. The vast majority of those surgeries don't happen until adulthood. Most gender-affirming surgeries are not done on transgender people at all, but on cisgender people receiving cosmetic surgeries for various reasons. More cisgender minors get breast surgery than transgender minors, by far, and that's been the case for, well, ever. But, you're only hearing outrage about it now, and only because of transgender people getting those surgeries. Isn't that a bit odd?\n\nGender-affirming care for minors initially and primarily involves therapy and social transition up until puberty. And then, *some* will receive puberty blockers, but only after extensive care by multiple medical professionals. Of those who receive puberty blockers, some will later go on to have more extensive gender-affirming medical care, such as hormone therapy or surgery. Somebody who has been on puberty blockers long enough to merit moving on to those treatments *is not somebody who is even remotely likely to change their mind.*\n\nWhen it comes to those medical interventions, we aren't talking about a five year old who decides they like dolls and that means they must be a girl, and so whelp, I guess we have to pump them full of drugs and cut off their genitals! ... But, that's what the anti-transgender narrative wants you to think.Kk. Keep your shitty irrelevant opinion to yourselfIf she needs to go for saying \u201cyou have blood on your hands\u201d and pointing a mic, fine. \n\nBut those standards need to be applied to every single politician so bye bye\u2026the entire GOP.  \n\nThink these culture battles through.Too challenging to the frail Christo-Fascist psyche? \n\nWell lots of toddlers have trouble with new things so it\u2019s not surprising the coward party doesn\u2019t wanna even try to debate her.Why?For...?why should a ban be put in place?  \n\n\nShould not the party of personal responsibility leave that decision up to the parents, child and doctor?  \n\n\nFurthermore, as we've seen in Missouri, it is in fact not really talking about people under 18  \n\n\nthe Helen Lovejoy Effect is here. it starts out with \"won't somebody think of the children\" then it becomes full blown fascism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot you specifically, but reactions like yours are why so many trans people live in terror right now.>I don't see an exact controversy being brought up if we really are talking about people under 18 years of age.\n\nI'd love to hear what you think gender affirming care actually is for youth under 18. Surgeries are rarely, if ever done, under 18. Hormones are only considered in late adolescence, 15-18. If the argument is that they don't have the mental development to consider that choice, than the same argument can be applied to raising the enlistment age from 17. But conservatives likely don't want to have that conversation.\n\n Blockers may be considered but we've given blockers to cisgender children diagnosed with precocious puberty for decades with no outrage. Funny how the right routinely gatekeeps gender affirming and other medical care. MGTs proposed bill banning care carves out specific exemptions to allow intersex surgery on infants, a practice widely condemned in the medical community; crickets from the right. \n\nFor most kids, gender affirming care is going to be therapy and social transition. If diagnosed with gender dysphoria, there's a pretty extensive and specific diagnosing criteria that's followed. None of the medical decisions or treatment plans are done in haste, these are well managed by multiple medical professionals, the patient and the family.\n\n But with the vagueness of these bills, simply allowing therapy or social transition could be banned or criminalized. It leads to a slippery slope that will broadly impact healthcare across the board. Idaho is already seeing the effects of the abortion bans and bills as they lose providers and access to OBGYN services.\"Gender-affirming care\" includes things like social transitioning (i.e. changing names/pronouns, wearing clothing and hairstyles and so on appropriate for a trans person's true gender, that sort of stuff), and hormone therapy (both delaying natural puberty and getting the trans person to go through a puberty appropriate for their true gender). It's not just surgery, and there are few doctors who would encourage anyone under the age of 18 to go through an elective surgery. \n\nI totally understand cis people being squeamish about surgery for trans people under the age of 18. Very few trans people under the age of 18 get surgery because very few doctors are willing to recommend it. This bill (and others like it) bans hormone therapy and limits which healthcare providers can recommend social transitioning to just the ones who aren't using any state property, which is basically saying \"trans people don't get to do anything, even totally reversible things, until they're 18\".\u201cI don\u2019t see the problem with big government dictation how you raise your kids and what medical treatments you seek for them\u201d\n\nLemme guess you\u2019re one of them \u201csmall gubment\u201d republicans?The \"disruption\" started after they refused to let her speak on any bills until she apologized for saying that lawmakers who take healthcare away from trans people have blood on their hands. That's it, that's all she did, and they banned her from speaking because of it. She, an elected representative, literally had no voice in the chamber, so her constituents had no choice but to be \"disruptive\" if they wanted to be heard.Not listening to the public is no way to run a governmentThere is a line somewhere that goes something like this:\r  \n\r  \n*When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.*\r  \n\r  \nThe Montana government *should* fear the people.This started because they broke their own rules and wouldn't let a voted-in-member speak on a bill. The disruption is because fascists and rule breakers don't have to be tolerated.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/1171921647/zooey-zephyr-transgender-montana-house-republicans-blocking-speech-decorum\"I don't think segregation is the right answer but this trend of non-violent sit ins isn't great and should be discouraged.\"That assumes a montana run government is beneficial.If said government is trampling on the liberties of its citizens solely because those citizens are part of a disliked minority group... I'm not sure what legitimacy they have anyway. Better no legislature than that one.So you prefer the status quo?People tend to get a bit mad when you tell them they aren't people, especially when you try to pass bills that state as much.So we need to get rid of the right wingers and their conspiracy nonsense?Have any politicians involved?A duly elected representative being silenced is a big deal and related to r/politicsIt should be an option.\n\nHave you looked at that stats or seen that it\u2019s been recommended by top psychiatric and medical organizations?\n\nIt\u2019s not like an 8 year old walks in and gets it. They bring in medical specialists, the parents, and ensure it\u2019s the right path to take.Dude, just admit you don't know what GAC is and someone will be happy to explain it to you.I agree, it should be an 18+ decision for adults to make for themselves. Not for kids who don\u2019t even have fully developed brains and can\u2019t think for themselves.> don't want more perverts in power\n\nThan why the fuck would you want the republicans to succeed?Hate democracy and free speech, huh? Well there's a party for you.well there is the callous cruelty of preventing trans people from transitioning.Oh, so the problem is the person who points out the violence the MT GOP is trying to commit, and not the people who are committing that violence?So just to be clear, you don\u2019t want her to have freedom of speech and you also want Trump, Boebert, MTG etc. all silenced and expelled for their hateful violent rhetoric too right?  \n\n\n\u2026right?You mean republicans wanting to exterminate trans people?Veiled threats? Get out of here. The party of trump and mean tweets is scared of the phrase \"blood on your hands.\"> get attention\n\nYou mean, like leaving horribly bigoted comments on a post that calls out bigotry?This isn\u2019t a two sides kinda deal. The American left is hardly centrist let alone \u201ccommunist\u201d. \n\nWhat we just witnessed is a party hiding behind \u201cdecorum\u201d as an excuse to punish a state\u2019s only transgender representative in an ongoing attempt at further marginalizing trans people.\n\nMe wanting to live my life in peace as a trans person isn\u2019t communist.Then you don't know what you're looking at or the definition of both words.Almost no GAC given to minors is permanent. You could have asked for clarification, since you clearly don't understand the issue at hand, but you chose to say that instead.Are minors altering the bodies this way without a parent's consent?We been letting minors alter their body for centuries.

I\u2019m baffled at what conservatives are getting away with. They\u2019re proud domestic terrorists ffs.My guess? When and if a Republican gets expelled for something egregious (like, I dunno, trying to overthrow the government), Republicans will try to play both the \"nothing burger retaliation\" and \"both sides\" angle to convince ignorant Independent voters that the GOP isn't so bad.The Tennessee Three were an important precedent that Republicans can openly despise democracy and work to expel fairly elected peers.\n\nIn Tennessee, they tried the argument that bringing a bullhorn and whatever was a breach of decorum. The highest level of punishment for that is supposed to be censure, so it was itself a terrible excuse.\n\nBut what even is the argument here? They're going to expel her for being mean?They\u2019re upset that the legislative chamber is no longer a Safe-Space.Now? They\u2019ve been doing this for centuries.\nIt\u2019s a power grab. They\u2019re fascists and all of this shit happening across the country is a giant attempt at seizing power and changing the rules to put themselves permanently in power, so they can then turn around to everyone else and say \u201cit\u2019s not us, it\u2019s just the rules.\u201dIt\u2019s not about feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s about doing whatever it takes to win: to make it as difficult, inconvenient, expensive, painful, or deadly as possible \u2014 whatever! \u2014 to exemplify, or support, diversity.\n\nIt\u2019s a common mistake: to interpret strategic right-wing behavior as personal, reflexive, unthinking.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand it rightly, because *dismissing* it as petty, immature, stupid, etc., prevents effective, strategic resistance. There\u2019s little chance of victory if the fight *we\u2019re* fighting is not the fight *they\u2019re* fighting.\n\nConsider how routinely Trump has been dismissed as stupid, delusional, etc, while again & again & again & again & again getting what he wanted \u2014 to the shock & dismay of his critics who, nevertheless, kept dismissing him as stupid & delusional.\n\nThey exploit our na\u00efvet\u00e9, again & again & again\u2026>So this is their play now, huh? Just gonna expel anyone they can?\n\nThat's what they tried in TN. That's the only play they have, as a political party.\n\nWhen political systems and individuals live in a bubble, degenerate, dysfunctional, and self-destructive behavior becomes inevitable.[removed]I'd guarantee that if you look for any Abortion hearing that these right wingers have called Democratic candidates or councilpersons \"baby killers\" and worse.

Today's extremist Republicans are convinced of something that simply won't ever again be true - there simply aren't enough of them to win a national election. \n\nHard to rejoice in that fact knowing non-white, non-Christian, non-straight people will continue to suffer more and more in red states, but at least we'll most likely NEVER have to deal with a Trump or DeSantis as President again.You know that\u2019s the definition of stupidity! .\nDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different out come !The degree of metacognitive failure is quite something.

A lot less national attention on this.The person they elected who is part of and is willing to stand up and speak out for a minority is getting censured, and people are protesting and getting arrested. I know you are trying to express sarcasm but im not picking up on it? Sex based discrimination is more tolerable than race based discrimination?To be fair, Montana is a much, much smaller state (in terms of population), and this is literally the first reporting nationally I've seen on it. But yeah, she's probably not going to get quite as much support nationally as the Justins did. It remains easy to ignore people like me and Rep. Zephyr who only make up less than 1% of the population.>In Montana, though, vacancies are only filled by special election.\n\nThat is incorrect, here are the [relevant code sections](https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0050/chapter_0020/part_0040/sections_index.html).That isnsuch bullshit. The GOP is literally silencing those they don't agree with.I don't think the average Republican voter has figured out that the only way to do the first thing is to do the second. But by the time they do, they'll still support it. The Nazis went through the same evolution.This is a great time for people in the LGBT community to take advantage of the second amendment and arm themselvesGenocide, Oppress, PunishDon't be so sure. Plenty of people have transgendered friends and relatives.TIL if we just let trans people live their lives that means we can't have any gun lawsYes, but I'm also not republicanAnd/or that taking action against a transgender legislator won\u2019t cause outrage in the same way that taking action against Black legislators did.Montana is closer to being a swing state than Tennessee and they have an extremely\nImportant senate race in 2024.This is going to be the new \u201cTennessee\u201d - this always backfired on them but the GOP are so dumb they keep repeating the same BS over and over.No. That's the biblical way to treat disobedient children. There is nothing in the bible about transgenderism.Good. Thank you.Missoula, where Zooey is from, is known as being a very left leaning city. \"Full of hippies\", is what it is often said. There are lots of indigenous tribes in the state that vote form the Democratic Party, plus old Union bastions like Butte. It is a complex state, like most states in the union.Plenty of Democrats in Montana, especially in places like Missoula, where this legislator is from.Montana had the only vote against World War 2. It wasn't until Citizens United invalidated our ban on corporate campaign contributions that our legislature was captured by corporate interests again. Unfortunately we are all going to have to learn the lesson Montana learned in the 1800's when the Copper Kings owned the state government.\n\nThey are pushing what they know will cause outrage so we don't pay attention to the regulatory capture going on.Bingpot!\n\nTennessee has shown that getting rid of your opponents once they are elected IS an option for majority legislative bodies everywhere. It is fascism, straight up.If we track them as a cult they are rapidly moving up in the paranoia track. So they will probably take it up to 8 sooner than later.I'm not federal to state expert, but this is from the FBI website:\n\n\"The FBI uses applicable federal laws, including the Hobbs Act, to investigate violations by public officials in federal, state, and local governments. A public official is any person elected, appointed, employed, or otherwise having a duty to maintain honest and faithful public service.\"\n\nAs far as crime/motive, well that would be open to interpretation.\n\nIronically, my spitball idea would appear authoritarian. But something needs to be done about this. Because as we know, their fascist tendencies tend to creep up in severity.\n\nEdit: added quotation mark.\"Lock her up! Lock her up!\". Hmmmm...\n\nExcept it's not about politics. It's about your side eroding the democratic process. You guys call everything rigged; sometimes even find fraudulent votes before the first vote is cast. Magic.\n\nYou guys keep trying to ruin the country and I have a vested interest in that not happening.\n\nHave a good day.It was the same when I lived in Idaho. Lots of people loved to complain about the liberal Californians moving in and ruining the state, but every Californian I knew was there to make the state more red.I don't buy that one bit. I welcome everyone to come to Montana.\n\nWhat turned our state red was [American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v.

Billions in the entire world have the same opinion.If OP could read, he'd probably find this valuable!I sort of covered what your are asking in my comment to another user so I'll paste it in and see if I can fill in any gaps.:\n\n>I personally think it should be allowed after they reach adult age. There are many things we restrict until 18 and something as permanent or involving body altering surgery or treatments I view as the same. Maybe if they do have parental consent it can be treated the same way as tattoos , piercing's, or cosmetic surgeries and be done at 16-17 years old.  \n>  \n>My personal views are that young pre-adult teenagers and adolescents are still not at a stage where they can fully process what they will be , give consent, or make such decisions that have lifelong effects with any accuracy. In less serious matters than gender transition I've know people that regret lesser things like tattoos or body modifications because of their quality, their negative meaning (drug,gang, or racial typically), or the health effects that the changes presented later in life. Hormone/puberty blockers aren't as extreme as more serious drugs like cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Those more extreme drugs are used to treat prostate cancer, breast cancer, and to chemically castrate individuals by choice or as punishment for sexual offenders. I would not support the harsher chemicals or surgeries for pre-18 individuals.\n\nSo you mention raising the enlistment age and I 100% agree. Our youth shouldn't be culled for wars before they are even adults and mentally able to understand the gravity of decisions let alone being charged with the potential to fight , kill, and die in war.\n\nAs for MGT I can't really listen to her speak for long and don't agree with really anything I've ever heard her say. Her proposed bill making an exemption for infant surgery isn't a shocker but as you might have seen in my quoted post I wouldn't support that personally.\n\nI have no disagreement on the rest of your post as therapy and social transition I take no issue with. My only reservation is with the use of harsher drugs or surgeries for a non adult. If someone wants to make that change more permanent when they are 18 I have no objection. Not what I chose but its their life and they should be able to live it as they see fit.Yeah another user highlighted the use of therapy and social transition as more common for the pre 18 individuals and I don't take  issue with that.Not against the idea of a smaller government influence in people's lives but for some things like childcare some people just aren't made out to be parents.   A government should have some say in how it protects the populations most vulnerable. Should that government make every decision? No of course not.The public should absolutely have channels for voice, but allowing a small group to shut down proceedings through yelling isn't really a legitimate one.Well, sure, I'm pretty easy to sell on the idea that governments do quite a lot of harm and most people would be better off with them doing less in general, but I don't think accomplishing my goals by yelling at people is a valid approach.[removed]But ultimately it's up to the kid right? How can you ask an 8 year old if they want to get a permanent life altering procedure and lose the ability to have kids of their own? When I was 8, I was playing with Bionicles.[deleted]They can do it once they are 18 nothing is stopping adults from transitioning, this bill is solely for the protection of minors. Transitioning is such a life altering choice that cannot be reversed, is it so bad that those who decide to go this route should be made to wait until their brains are fully developed and they understand everything that comes along with the process?No the problem is people trying to conflate legislation with violence. Gender affirming care and violence have zero overlap.Freedom of speech does not include threats Buddy. So long as the left continues to support the military industrial complex, and the right obviously, anything you just said is bullshit.\nI\u2019ll edit this to add: I do want you to live in peace. Be we are not living in a peaceful world. And your left is contributing to that.[removed]FairIt's loopholes.\n\nThings where \"gentlemen\" just didn't do that petty shit in the old days and so it wasn't a concern. \n\nNow, the Boys Club doesn't even pretend to have honor, they just spend their days hunting black people, women, and LGBTs.They won\u2019t change until people have the spine to stop them.  Democrats certainly don\u2019t.

Everything since has been inevitable with how emboldened the GOP feels.  Why not do a fascism if no one is going to stop you?Biden admin should declare Montana GOP as a terrorist organization and apply the full force of the PATRIOT act. \n\nSpecifically, on the anti-terror funding laws:\n\n- access to funds and accounts by Montana GOP should be frozen and assets seized\n- banks should be cautioned against engaging in business with terrorist organizations like the Montana GOP\n- all federal contractors should be advised that they are prohibited from doing business with terrorist organizations\n\nMontana has basically turned into a cheap state for financial service companies to operate. Shut the GOP out, turn to the banks and say \"if you do business in Montana you can't do business with the fed.\"\n\nturn off the tap and the lobbyists will be carry Ms Zephyr, bullphone in hand, back into the chamber on their shouldersKey words = domestic terroristsRight - it\u2019s literally now taxation without representation for her constituents.We should all know by now, the words \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cmoral\u201d have nothing to do with it.

If it hasn't, they'll make a big deal about it until one of their own does it. Then it was \"never a big deal.\"\n\nFuck the \"both sides\" angle.They\u2019ll pull out the ol\u2019 \u201cThese people get so disorderly when we want to have a nice civil discussion about making them not exist!\u201d card.

Both cannot co-exist in an evidence based world, and the religious doctrine has failed to evolve fast enough to be compatible with society.The side that wants to end democracy has been given quite enough.Wait. what's the other side here? How are people who want democracy supposed to give an inch to fascists?Dems have given waaaaay to much to a group that immediately snarls and bites at the hand that literally feeds them. Obama's first term was such a disappointment because he compromised entirely to much with a political party that soundly lost the election. Dems need to start being more strong armed and passing policy the people vote them in to do so. If we wanted Republican policy they wouldn't lose so often.What is Biden trying to do please explain yourself. Edited to add why I voted for Biden because he was and is the better option than DJTBecause he is still part of the old Dems of compromise. We need progressive Dems that will rightly tell loser Republicans exactly where to stick it.Honestly,  I wouldn't be surprised if it was true for some of them. They put so much stock in their masculinity nothing would hurt them more than admitting their wang doodles are tiny tallywackers.6 was the human response. The other 5 was ChatGPT answering the question \"why are Republican lawmakers such douchenozzles\"Bottom surgery is harder in that case, there was a fairly recent case where a relatively young person died from infection due to complications of bottom surgery because the doctor tried to use bowel because there wasn't enough to work with to do penile inversion.\n\nIt's being used by all the expected right-wing wackos to argue against trans healthcare in general.In this case I don't feel like it is body shaming, since it's not about shaming their tiny pork swords, but about the psychological issues in regards to how they deal with having such a small jock jiggler.    One can easily survive and be civil while having a small wang without having to take out the frustration of having a small gherkin on anyone else.what they are being shamed for is taking out their own body shame on others.\n\nit's ok if one has got a shrinky dink, it's not ok to be an insecure masculinist lashing out because of one's less impressive statureBig dick/little dick energy isn't physical. It is a state of mind.The term today is \"people of color\" don't be a bigot!Fucking bravo - I just got chills. That is such a powerful statement for anyone in the GOP crosshairs. Very appropriate for her to speak on trans rights - which is why they don\u2019t want her to.Yes.It's not a joke.The fact that they publically acknowledge how polarizing the abortion topic is for them and yet they continue to lean in to it is pretty tellingWell, for the most part they've built in a bias towards themselves, extreme in many cases.  Gerrymandering is a science now and purely evil.  Eventually, it's going to cause problems for them, the question is if it's too late to do it at the ballot and not with bullets.I don\u2019t think winning national elections is their main goal, rather these cruel policies are designed to drive out all but the most rabid conservative voters out of these states so they can consolidate their power.  Convention of states is the end game.> Exactly, just look at their abortion strategy. Voters keep saying no, and GOP keeps saying, \"fuck you we're banning it anyway.\"\n\nEven more deeply than that - We already tried a policy of abortion ban in this country, and it was a terrible idea that results in women dying.If you look at history, what usually happens when one political organisation decides to stop listening to the people and thinks they are more important than the people. It never ends well, I think this fair to say. Let\u2019s hope the young people can save the situation \ud83e\udd1eThey don't even bother with that anymore, it's become all culture politics at this point.  Anti-trans, anti-abortion, anti-woke (whatever that is), etc.  They no longer even have real policies they're running on.\"Honest. Try it just one more time....\"They are Christians. The self proclaimed core of their identity is a delusion. How can they do anything but act delusional? They've surrendered to it, and made it a way of life. Anything else is blasphemy to them.Unless the Supreme Court says otherwise and anoints them the President by some stupid obscure law.The story broke litterally an hour ago that\u2019s why there isn\u2019t national attention yetI\u2019m flat out saying people are less willing to support a trans person who stood up for trans people. I completely agree with you that one shouldn\u2019t be more tolerable than the other, but people are sure treating it that way. It\u2019s sad and disheartening.Thanks, I stand corrected, I looked in the Montana Constitution but forgot to check the statutes.Nazis and republicans are the same, they\u2019re stupid.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_f%C3%BCr_SexualwissenschaftWhich I think is a massive miscalculation.  The sheer national outrage won\u2019t be the same, I\u2019d agree, but should she be outright expelled moments like this(if played the right way) are key demonstrations to folks without contact with the targeted minority. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to demonize and fearmonger against a group most people don\u2019t have contact with, and to minimize the harm the discrimination does when most people don\u2019t see the effects.  Incidents like this provide high-profile windows into the reality of the situation, and help undermine the narratives being told about a target minority being \u201cuppity\u201d or irrationally dangerous due to how blatantly it contradicts them.  \n\nIt\u2019s the same Streisand Effect we saw in Tennessee, just working a little differently.Bold of you to assume they have read the bible enough to know that.>No. That's the biblical way to treat disobedient children\n\nI thought it was bears?Montana even sent the first woman to congress (who then was that vote against WW2). \n\nRankin was elected before women even had a right to vote in most states. She was the only woman to vote to give other women the right to vote. Montana is indeed one of the most interesting states politically and has been for effectively it\u2019s entire history.>she was removed for inciting protests which disrupted it.\n\nThis is incredibly dishonest.\n\nShe pointed a microphone at protestors. That's it.\n\nI don't get why you guys not only let your politicians lie *to* you, you help lie *for* them. Do better.\n\n>for transgender CHILDREN, that\u2019s an important piece of information that you conveniently left out.\n\nIrrelevant, unless you're suggesting children aren't people and don't have feelings or thoughts.The protests she \"incited\" occurred after they censured her and demanded an apology. And she \"incited\" them by pointing a microphone symbolically (it wasn't on) in their direction while they were already protesting.\n\nTransgender children deserve healthcare, and there's nothing wrong with gender-affirming care for transgender children. You may disagree with that, but that is utterly beside the point. She wasn't censured for her position on gender-affirming care, was she? ... well, actually, I think she was. But that's not the story you are defending.She didn't incite the protests, the bigoted fascists choosing transgender people as their \"out group\" incited the protests.Healthcare for kids in general seems to make them angrykk.  Keep your shitty, ignorant and irrelevant opinion to yourself.\n\nLet the people that actual know something about the subject talk>My only reservation is with the use of harsher drugs or surgeries for a non adult.\n\nAnd as we've said, surgeries are rarely, if ever, done. The issue is that these are broad, vague bills. So the things you do support are very likely to be banned and even criminalized. And as we're seeing in Missouri, they'll ultimately use it to eventually ban adults from care. There is no place for a legislature with no medical qualifications to broadly decide an issue that's for a doctor and patient.Most trans people, even adults, never do any medical transitioning. It's expensive and difficult and isn't even what they all want.Our government is opposed to giving free lunch to poor kids but we wanna let them get involved in healthcare?  \n\nWhy don\u2019t we feed the kids first and put our money where our mouth is instead of restricting access to healthcare.  Trans people exist, they\u2019re not being tricked into it by weird parents that would prefer their kids to be on expensive medications and likely ridiculed by conservatives for their whole lives.  There\u2019s no conspiracy of parents or doctors fooling kids into gender affirming care, and there\u2019s no data that suggest a bunch of kids are accidentally trying to become trans either.  \n\nThese bans are about punishing an out group to make an in group feel like they\u2019re above someone else, nothing more.  This isn\u2019t a solution to any real problem and we all know it.There was a certain Party that enjoyed Tea that set a precedent that they may be regretting now>The public should absolutely have channels for voice\n\nLike an elected representative? You care a lot more about the disruptions resulting from the rep being silenced than you do about the rep being silenced.This wouldn't have happened if they let the legitimately elected officials speak for her constituents. But they're too thin skinned to hear the truth from someone who's been through the suffering they're trying to institutionalize.When the majority proposes absurd legislation its not shocking to get a justifiable rebellious response.Nope. I\u2019m a mid-30s cis white male. But I have empathy and think that my lgbtq friends don\u2019t deserve to be treated like trash by the GOPIt\u2019s not ultimately up to the kid. Its up to the consensus of all the professionals and the parents. \n\nFor example, if a kid has cancer, they don\u2019t choose the best path forward - the doctors do - with advisory from the parents. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m not an expert. But, I follow the recommendations made by the medical community when making medical decisions. \n\nAt this crossroads, I don\u2019t know enough. So, I\u2019m choosing the sides that the medical experts are on. \n\nSee for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-states-stop-interfering-health-care-transgender-childrenWhat permanent life altering procedure for an 8 year old are you talking about?Legislation that *causes violence to occur.*  Denial of healthcare is violence in and of itself, and the self-harm downstream from denial of healthcare should also matter to you.> trying to conflate legislation with violence\n\nGenocide is okay if it's legislated.  Got it\u201cYou have blood on your hands\u201d is a declarative statement. \n\nNow \u201clock her up\u201d\u2026that\u2019s a threat babeeee.Saying that a law will cause children to die if passed is not making a threat, it is stating a fact.Never said I supported the military industrial complex. But if I have to chose between the side that wants me dead and the side that wants me less dead, imma go with the side that wants me less dead.It's almost like saying stupid shit makes people like you less. You could have figured this out when you were 5-8 like the rest of us but better late than never.I wasn't saying she existing is bad. I'm saying she is being target just for the fact she exists. The attacks on trans people need to stop.That\u2019s just fulfilling Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d promise. His definition of \u201cgreat\u201d was the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s where it was still okay to have the KKK and segregation and being gay was a crime, and any minorities getting out of their place faced threats and intimidation. DeSantis and the rest are doubling down on that. \u201cLet\u2019s undo 60 years of progress to go back to the era of bigotry and government witch hunts.\u201ddon't say they didn't do that shit in the old days. back right before the civil war they were beating each other with canes and showing up armed to congress.Because \"those people\" have invaded their safe spaces and they are BIG MAD about it.Democrats are trying to appoint a temporary replacement for Feinstein on the judiciary committee. Republicans are blocking it. I'm not just talking bullshit and I agree the party dragged their feet on her way too long and should have been pushing for retirement but as of right now this is what the situation is.Does this work? It\u2019s an interesting statement.I fucking love this comment.All dems need to understand what you are saying.... Obama, on behalf of his corporate backing, taught them to say when they go low we go high. That's a huge mistake. Dems need to fight fire with fire.Was (blood on your hands) the comment that they call a breach of decorum?Yeah, just in case anyone might have been on their side with the whole decorum thing, might as well throw in some bald faced racism lolIt's worse than generic tribalism. It's Christian Nationalism and they are not going to stop this time. They have a very narrow window to take over and they know it. This is the end game for them.When have dems tried to expel someone over mild insultsair national guardsmanUnless you\u2019re willing to go so far right that they can prop you up as the token. They LOVE hardcore conservative minorities because it makes them feel less racist.I hope they're not shocked when eventually the party starts asking if you're the right kind of white or Christian.Beware the Christian crusades are returningWhat is the first policy you would pass if you could pick one?Would that same logic work for any other physical characteristic? \n\nCould I say \"ugh that Ben Carson, guess that's what he gets for being black\" just because Ben Carson is a tool? No, it would still be racist\n\nThere's so much to criticize about these people that are real, valid criticisms. Resorting to a bunch of goofy analogies for their bodies is just stooping to their level.>what they are being shamed for is taking out their own body shame on others.  \n>  \n>it's ok if one has got a shrinky dink, it's not ok to be an insecure masculinist lashing out because of one's less impressive stature\n\nBy comparison, what sort of negative comments about a woman's anatomy would be acceptable to reference with regard to her political stances or rhetoric?  Didn't think so.No, no it\u2019s not. Misgendering her, or implying as such is not a joke.The fact that they keep winning elections despite waving their Fascist policies around is pretty telling.It's because that is what wedge issues are meant to do. It's nothing new but always grabs our attention. \n\nWe focus on them, because they're so fucking insane and damaging, all while 99% of the other legislation passed is overlooked. They're not stupid, they're incredibly effective and we fall for it often.That's how much they care!!!! /sIt's already causing problem for them at the ballot. They barely gained a majority in the House which was basically guaranteed by gerrymandering and not voter turnout. And just wait till 2024...That's 1.5 years more of Zoomers becoming old enough to register and Boomers dying off.\n\nThey've made their bed...now they're getting ready lay in it.It takes 2/3 to call a convention of states, yes.  But to ratify whatever bats#!t crazy amendments they might come up with (even if it\u2019s an entirely new constitution) takes 3/4.  And with 17 states currently with a Democrat trifecta, there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll get 38 legislatures to ratify.Hate and fear. Those are the guiding principles for their policies. Anything that maintains those attitudes is valid policy.It\u2019s been going on for more than a week.This has been a story for a bit of time now. I was reading about her and this issue last Wednesday.?  No the story broke a week ago, the National News just didn't care enough to carry itThere are 1.1 million people in Montana, there are almost 7 million people in Tennessee with a lot more democratic stronghold cities, of course your gonna have more people who come out and support the Tennessee three, then the rep from montana. Why does this have to be a trans/ race issue. It\u2019s a Democratic issue. Everyone should be pissed that an elected member of a body of government is being expelled Undemocratically. Don\u2019t try and divide us into groups when we all know that this is huge issue. Any democrat can be expelled in a Republican majority state so don\u2019t just make it about trans people when it\u2019s clearly about democratically elected people being suppressed. It\u2019s shit like that that makes the trans movement lose support.I've been trying to dig into this all myself as well, to get a handle around what the process of punishment and or expulsion should look like in the state.\n\nIf they're holding to code and procedure, today will be a [2/3 vote to decide if she will be punished](https://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/title_0000/article_0050/part_0010/section_0100/0000-0050-0010-0100.html), at which time, they will need to form a Legislative Conduct Panel and [censure or expulsion will require that the matter be referred to the ethics committee](https://leg.mt.gov/content/Sessions/68th/2023-Rules.pdf) by the panel.It's also incremental.  \n\nIt might not have the same level of outrage, but Republicans keep doing more and more overtly shitty things that make it to national headlines in increasing frequency.\n\nMaybe no one thing is an electoral game changer, but the more shit like this they pull the more the overall outrage they provoke going into the next election while at the same time giving a national platform to people they are trying to negate.\n\nI am long past hope and usually a hell of a cynic, but I am getting a glimmer of hope that ourrage going into 2024 will be enough to flip some state and national outcomes despite gerrymandering and voter suppression from the right.\n\nMight be our last chance before we fully turn into at Nat-C kingdom of authoritarian dick-baggery.>Irrelevant, unless you're suggesting children aren't people and don't have feelings or thoughts.\n\nThe reason it's irrelevant is that the cover story is *not* that she was disciplined for supporting gender-affirming care. Opinions on gender-affirming care should be irrelevant unless they are admitting that this is why she was silenced, which just makes them look worse.Ahhhh I see , the precedent set by Missouri is that this could/would be used to deny adults care and frewill of choice. That I agree is a problem more so if the legislation is not consulting medical advisors of some kind and either made the bills broad and vague because they are not educated on the topic or did so intentionally to target this population.Fair points on perhaps why we shouldn't entrust the government further with healthcare related concerns. I guess I would ask then how would the medical community self regulate the age parameters for various therapies and procedures and deal with unethical for profit practitioners that may go outside the norms even for this rather niche field. How would they deal with malpractice without some government involvement. Thats above my pay grade and more of a rhetorical question than anything.I am suspicious that Walter is \"concern-trolling,\" given the sequence of events that led up to this moment in Montana.What would your thoughts be were it a few right-wingers in the California Assembly, shouting down any attempts to pass firearms regulation? Is there a symmetry in which *anyone* that thinks a legislature is being absurd gets to shut them up and stop proceedings  or is this intended to only be used by the people that you consider the good guys?Just finished that article. So that's the AMA CEO's take, and I think it's certainly in line with the stance of the larger medical community at the moment. The doctors who do these surgeries on kids will probably also agree with everything he said there.\n\nBut even if everyone in the room, parents, doctors, and the kid agree, they at some point asked the kid \"do you want to go through with this?\" \n\nI don't think an 8 year old is capable of fully grasping the ramifications of a complete sex change surgery.Gender affirming surgery, mainly.Did someone die and I missed it?\" You will have blood on your hands\" is a threat.\n\n\"Lock her up\" is a requested instructionThey both want you dead. And if the right goes away, nothing changes. The sooner you stop supporting the lesser evil the better. No one gives a single shit about you or me outside of friends and family. I\u2019m struggling immensely because I was brainwashed as a child by both republicans and democrats to join the army and go kill evil bogeymen. Is anyone going into your house because you queer? Because I went into hundreds of straight Iraqi peoples house, by the order of a democratic president. Thanks Obama you where no better than Bush. Why didn\u2019t you defend them, the Iraqis. Because they would kill you without even thinking about. What about Julian Assange. Why are you supporting the group trying to ruin a whistleblower. Why are you not supporting women and the fact that women need safe spaces away from both men and Trans person? Maybe you support some of this. But your party is no Saint. I honestly can\u2019t understand how anyone can support and republican or democrat at this point in history. They are both very corrupt. And an an independent/Green Party supporter, I think your all the same. I Apologies if anything I said was insulting I honestly have no way to know what is safe to say or not say anymore. And that is a fucking problemI was agreeing with the sentiment you were/are expressingYes, that is precisely it, turning back the clock to a time when old white, straight men (I am one) outnumbered everyone and could do as they please.\nThe inevitable future scares them.I particularly remember Trump saying \u201cwe need to bring back the death penalty \u201c & the MAGA cult crowd going wild with enthusiasm..\nThey\u2019re just getting started with that now..\nfor rape crimes with a simple majority ,instead of unanimous vote. Imagine how many disturbed & embarrassed teens would point the finger for innocent people to die..We are ignorant of history (all of us) when we think Trump and his cult are smart enough to invent anything.\n\n\"Make America Great Again\" was a Reagan campaign slogan, VERBATIM. Reagan gave a famous speech promising to \"return rights to the states, where they belong\" in Philadelphia Mississippi, where only 15 years before 18 Klan members murdered 3 Freedom Riders and the jury found the murderers not guilty.  (For comparison, 9/11 was 22 years ago; many of the killers were not only alive, they were in the audience).\n\n\"America First\" is not NeoNazi, White Nationalist, AltRight, etc. It is 100% the original recipe Nazis. [Enjoy this image of Charles Lindberg](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/07/22/ap_411003015_sq-6165142bf0a53b7cce5a609a51ccc6a0f0ca03d6-s800-c85.jpg), one of America's most famous, historical, actual Nazis; speaking in Madison Square Garden. He is arguing \"America First.\" (betray our alliances, turn on our allies, and fully support the Nazi takeover of Europe, \"finally solving\" their \"question\".)\n\nThis isn't building to something.\n\nIt's built. Been built for a long time.\n\nWe need to burn it to the ground or watch as these monsters continue. This particular political ideology only survives by escalating. It has to stop now.A mild passing phrase of it without even a hint of raised voice.  Yes.Is it bald faced?\n\n\nI always thought it was bold faced.Nationalist-Christians, Nat-Cs if you will.I\u2019ve got a new term for these types.  \u201cPray-triots\u201d - fascists hiding behind the shield of religion, to push their bullshit personal political goals.Ok I will bite - if you are enlisted in the air national guard as an E-3 you are called a what? Go!They love anyone who sells their own kind out. Those are votes. They don\u2019t ask questions about their own votes.Increasing corporate taxes back to 45 percent for one after that it be universal healthcare with mental care being included. Massive cuts to the military with total restructuring to modernize for a future world.You're absolutely correct. Using derogatory comments or making negative assumptions about individuals based on their physical characteristics, race, or any other personal attribute is not acceptable and is considered disrespectful, discriminatory, and inappropriate. It's important to avoid engaging in such behavior and instead focus on constructive criticism and respectful communication when expressing opinions or discussing individuals, regardless of their background or physical appearance.\n\n\nWhen providing criticism or feedback about someone's actions or behavior, it's important to do so in a respectful and constructive manner, focusing on specific behaviors or actions rather than resorting to personal attacks or derogatory comments. Using derogatory language, making assumptions based on physical characteristics, or engaging in discriminatory behavior is not conducive to healthy communication or respectful relationships.\n\n\nIt's always best to approach discussions and interactions with kindness, empathy, and respect towards others, regardless of any differences or disagreements. By promoting respectful communication and understanding, we can foster positive relationships and contribute to a more inclusive and compassionate society.\n\n\nAlthough I do think context is also important.the karen haircut, would be an example.\n\nIt's not that she got the bob cut, it's that she is asking to talk to the manager, or calling the cops on minorities.\n\na bit pushy answering your own question with a \"didn't think so\" wasn't it?I was pointing out your use of the wrong adjectives, not making insinuations about gender.This is the scary part.Gerrymandering. Don\u2019t assume people are actually voting for them as much as They say they are.They\u2019re catering to the extremists that want to ban it so they can keep using it as a fundraising and wedge issue. Party over country.They are really good at what they do which is scary.  They are a united front on their messaging. They actively and constantly rally their base. They have a \"news\" network doing 24 hr propaganda. And while in power they actively rig the system to create more followers and weaken their opponents.It would be foolish to assume they won't get worseYeah, I do think we really haven't yet seen the full force of the backlash against this stuff. They're not backing off, instead they're doubling down, and it's absolutely front and center. They're pushing more and more extreme policies and laws that only serve to alienate more people while not gaining them any votes they weren't already going to get.\n\nFor instance, the latest anti-Trans bill pushed by House Republicans got **zero** Democratic votes, not even from the squishiest of ultra-centrist Democrats, Henry Cuellar.But let\u2019s definitely act as if it was only 2/3 instead of waiting until there\u2019s only two states from it happening. I\u2019d really like to hear of some ideas of federal consequences to these extreme actions that remove elected officials from their elected offices.> It\u2019s shit like that that makes the trans movement lose support.\n\nAnd here I thought it was just transphobia. Silly me.Oh it\u2019s absolutely about democracy, but my sweet sibling in Satan, you cannot ignore that this is a trans person standing up for trans rights and national organizations which purport to be fighting for democracy have been silent. \n\nI worked on the TN 3 issue. I guarantee they were expelled because of racism. Just like Rep Zephyr is being attacked because of her identity. I\u2019m not making this about race or trans issues, the perpetrators are. \n\nIf calling that out makes you not want to support trans people then you need to unpack that.That's exactly what they are doing. These states limit the time medical experts can speak or stack the deck with their own \"experts\" that present woefully inaccurate information or junk science. \n\nKeep in mind that the more extreme of these bills will trickle down and ultimately affect access to medical care. When you threaten doctors with jail time, how many are going to choose to continue practicing in those states?I feel like we already have a court system to handle malpractice, and it\u2019s up to parents to inform themselves and make smart decisions with their child\u2019s healthcare. \n\nRemember, we allow parents to feed their kids endless amounts of sugar, sign them up for contact sports, and smoke cigarettes in houses and cars around them.  If you start trying to restrict medical care for trans kids on the basis that the government needs to protect kids from their parents harm, then it\u2019s gonna create a legal precedent that can be used to punish parents for any perceived danger they pose to their kids.  That\u2019s how big government gets huge.Oh yeah, he's a goober supreme for sure\n\n\nedit:  and we should probably not even engage him. He's either trolling or too stupid to understand, so lets not give him a soapboxYou don't seem to want to understand that restricting gender affirming health care will kill people.You're being disingenuous. She's not being silenced over a position on legislation. She's being silenced because she said something Republicans didn't like.I encourage you to do so. Im comfortable that you have no ground beneath you.\nIt isn\u2019t like a kid stealing a sip from their parents liquor cabinet.  It\u2019s a big medicinal procedure.\n\nPlus, It seems like you understand that the parents, doctors, and kids all have to agree before any moves are made. \n\nIf all three agree that the surgery is the right move, why shouldn\u2019t it be allowed?Multiple people have died and you apparently missed it, yeah.No it\u2019s a declarative statement.  She is saying they will hurt people and their hands will be covered in the metaphorical blood of the victims they harmed.  It\u2019s clearly a metaphor but even taken literally it\u2019s still a declarative statement about the harm the legislators are causing to others.  \n\nWords have meanings and there\u2019s zero chance you can win a semantics argument in court or online over this one bud.  It\u2019s a weak and disingenuous attempt at best.  Try again.How, is \"your actions will hurt people\" a threat?They\u2019ve never really outnumbered only out-powered. \n\nAnd they get the poor idiots to hate like they want them to hateThe very definition of reactionaryJFC. \n\nThanks for the clarity.Both are used\\~. Bold-faced began gaining traction because of bold font, the idea coming from headlines. Bald-faced is technically much older, however.\n\nBald *feels* worse, but that might be just me and hair sensitivity. I was a 6th grade teacher in Korea and one of my boys kept trying to see the top of my head one day. I asked what he was doing. His response: I want to see if you're bald. All the white teachers here are bald. \n\n... I considered slapping him. But then conducted my own investigation and learned he was right about everyone except for me and another guy in second grade. \n\nThen I just got real sad.I think it\u2019s scald faceThat\u2019s the truth! Can I use that?So accurate!!fresh meatI'm just going to share my observation that all of that, with the exception of the last sentence, reads *exactly* like a ChatGPT response.> the karen haircut, would be an example.\n\nI mean, it's a terrible one since that's a choice that anyone can change vs a physical attribute>the karen haircut, would be an example.\n\nThat's less anatomy and more a fashion choice, like \"neck beard\" or \"fedora\". As opposed to being short, bald, penis size, etc that are permanent anatomical traits of the person rather than a fashion choice. \n\n>a bit pushy answering your own question with a \"didn't think so\" wasn't it?\n\nFair enough, but I'm not wrong - it's considered far less acceptable to attack a woman using her anatomy, especially sexual anatomy.\n\nImagine saying a female legislator had some position because she was flat chested or similar.You did insinuate though. Clearly.Not to mention; they're burning political capital on being anti-trans. Back in the day they would have played lip service to it, but wouldn't have been stupid enough to actually do anything. Now they're...actually trying to do it. And most regular people who aren't drinking the coolaid are like WTF, why is THIS the most important issue?No you are right that comment may have come out across as trans phobic, I didn\u2019t mean for it to be I apologize.The article litterally came out today and rep zephyr tweeted out yesterday that she was being expelled or censure Do you really think all these organizations like the aclu and other groups can organize a defense in less then 12 hours overnight? Don\u2019t be so quick to blame everyone for not supporting this person when the news has barely even broke. Just because I just heard about it this morning and just because the organizations that support democracy probably just heard about it doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t speak out about it it takes time to prepare statements and plan the next moves. You just need to chill and not be so quick to blame. We can all be pissed about this but don\u2019t start attacking everyone who hasn\u2019t spoken out because they haven\u2019t heard about it yet.Yeah, I wish it didn't seem like a contest of what's worse, a political body trying to deem how to raise a kid or letting the average american parent raise their kid with no oversight. Where the lines are drawn I don't really know anymore.Oh, I'm well aware that this would swiftly result in being arrested, because it's not actually acceptable or legal behavior. Most people can pretty easily recognize that when it's not their pet issue. The obvious double standard is what I'm objecting to.I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't think the 8 year old kid should be allowed to agree or disagree because they cannot possibly fully understand what they are agreeing to. It's not fair to the 8 year old. \n\nIf all the adults in the room tell a kid it's a good idea and they go through with it, and they decide later that they don't like the choice they made and want to go back, who is at fault? The kid, for listening to adults? The parents for following the doctor's advice? The doctors for listening to the general medical consensus?She's the one with something to prove but can't. She's already on her way out the door. Done and done.Those exact words in that order would have been a sufficient alternative to the ones she used. Her threat was open ended and non specific but promised bloodletting which typically is the result of injurious harm.Yes.It's funny considering I only used ChatGPT for the last sentence.this doesn't in any way make men victims.\n\nit feels like you are making some sort of \"reverse sexism is real sexism\" claim, which always feels right *when* you disregard inequity for inequality.\n\nI value equity.You said they wouldn't treat a white male Democrat this way. Zephyr is a white *male* Democrat. There is no insinuation in that statement of fact.Thanks for the self reflection. But this is a common thread with trans issues. The trans community is expected to placate our \"allies\" or risk losing support form them. \n\nIt problematic in that it limits trans voices. I do agree that this is inherently a democratic issue, but in this case it is rooted in transfobia. I hope that people can support rep Zoey and help her overcome this but I fear that the montana legislature will just find another way to silence her. \n\nOn a side note its crazy to think that there are more trans people in america then there are people in montana. but with the decentralized nature of the trans community it is impossible to get anywhere near the same representation as the red states.As someone who helped book interviews, get boots on the ground, write op-eds, and organize rallies for the TN 3, yes! I promise it can be done in less than 12 hours. We literally did it. This is literally the work I do. \n\nAnd I promise these organizations have not just heard about it because several of us in coalitions have been pushing for more attention all week.I think we need to let parents raise kids, and accept that, and we can\u2019t start codifying medical treatments as abuse because religious zealots oppose it and republicans feed off culture wars to retain power.  It\u2019s really that simple.  If your son wants to wear mascara and a dress because they identify as female and feel most comfortable that way, that\u2019s ok.  It\u2019s not abuse and we don\u2019t need the likes of Tommy Tubberville, Marjorie Taylor Green and Donald Trump stepping in to dictate how we raise our children.The double standard is [republicans shout down democrats all the time](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/gop-reps-greene-boebert-heckle-biden-throughout-sotu-address-n1290558) but never criticize their own members for it. \n\nIt\u2019s disingenuous to pretend they care now when they openly show they have no intention of applying any of the same rules of decorum to themselves.Youre speculating. My speculations are that if they attempted that would be dismissed as irrelevant and tolerated.It\u2019s not only the kid though. It\u2019s a team decision. There are psychiatrically tests and evaluations done before any decision is made.\n\nOnce again let\u2019s turn the experts and data.\n\nLess than 1% of people who get gender reassignment surgery regret it.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099405/ \n\nSo, removing that option is against the greater good that it does. \n\nEspecially with a somewhere between 32-50% attempted suicide rate amongst trans people.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/\n\nAnd gender affirming care reducing suicide attempts by 70%\n\nhttps://www.hcplive.com/view/suicide-risk-reduces-73-transgender-nonbinary-youths-gender-affirming-careThere it is, the truth.  You know this is BS and you just want to get your way, and you care not for democracy.  This is why people like me call republicans fascists, so great work! \n\n>\tShe\u2019s already on her way out the door. Done and done.\n\nTell me again about how successful Tennessee was with this same exact plan?  Did it\u2026did it work? \n\nLastly, good luck in life as a homosexual Republican. In Missouri republicans are currently trying to censure a homosexual male who is an elected Republican, simply because he\u2019s gay.  Missouri is also hard at work attempting to re-ban gay marriage with legislation that would kick off a Supreme Court case so they can attempt a National ban too. \n\nIf you want to dehumanize trans people, don\u2019t come crying to me when you get dehumanized too.  Your allegiance is with the wrong folks I\u2019m afraid, and they will come for you next no matter how much you delude yourself.That is what the phrase \"there will be blood on YOUR hands\" means.\n\nIt isn't a threat, it means \"your actions will cause harm\".\n\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/have-blood-on-handsHave you never heard of a metaphor? \u201cYou will have blood on your hands\u201d means \u201cyour actions will hurt people\u201d.I'm increasingly unsure if you are some kind of bot or not, and that worries me.  It's almost like someone used ChatGPT with some variant of the DAN jailbreak, and then it forgot it was supposed to be DAN when challenged about the use of small dick comments (which is a thing that happens in protracted conversations with DAN).\n\nI guess on the upside, both all publicly accessible versions of GPT and Google Bard are absolutely terrible at devising [scissor statements.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/30/sort-by-controversial/)Hey I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to make GPT answer when you don't see it as worth the effort to do it yourself lol.> it feels like you are making some sort of \"reverse sexism is real sexism\" claim\n\n....what?\n\nNo one is saying \"men get a worse deal\". Discussing men's issues doesn't mean anyone is saying women don't experience real sexism.\n\nIt's the same way saying \"black lives matter\" isn't saying other lives don't, and a breast cancer charity isn't saying we shouldn't care about other forms of cancer.>I value equity.\n\n\"Equity\" is literally just trading \"it's wrong to discriminate or hate people for their innate characteristics\" in for \"you can discriminate and hate, so long as you do it to the *right people*\", which feels a lot like one of those things that demonstrates horseshoe theory.\n\nI'll point out my original question again: \"By comparison, what sort of negative comments about a woman's anatomy would be acceptable to reference with regard to her political stances or rhetoric?\" Fashion choices aren't anatomy, and using fashion choices as acceptable insults is something that works for both sexes (\"karen haircut\", \"problem glasses\", \"fedora\", \"neckbeard\") - anatomy, especially sexual anatomy isn't, that one is treated radically differently depending on the sex of the target.\n\nFor example, there were multiple upvoted cracks about the orange asshole's dick every week from 2016-2021, not so much regarding MTG or any other conservative woman.She is female. You are misgendering her. It would be a good idea not to argue this with a trans poster btw. Helpful tip.[removed]I like to think I'm a hybrid of both and one day when I cease to exist an AI will continue on in my place, and it'll be as if I never wasn't.   \n\nAs of right now it's about a 99.1% to 0.9% split.you didn't detect their sarcasm?That's a pretty transparent definition of equity.Then you have no excuse to not know that sex and gender are not the same. *She* is *male.* You could amend your statement to say they wouldn't treat a white Democrat woman this way and then you would be correctYou sound exactly like the kind of people that would put YOU in a camp in 1940\u2019s Germany bud.  Wild conspiracy theories about Trans people being a \u201cprivileged\u201d group trying to \u201cseize power\u201d.   What\u2019s next, calling all trans people pedos?> I'm not Republican nor do I align myself with most of their moral equivalencies\n\nYour stance says otherwise and the MT legislature will have blood on their hands.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*The party of law and order, everyone.No credibility.  Evangelical nuts prayed over the three time divorced, cheating, sexual harassing, \"dear leader\".  Working class under educated people supported him even though he had a history of not paying vendors and skipping out on his taxes.  Now the law and order party would support him even as a convicted felon.\n\nYep... it's a CULT.So most Republicans are fascist traitors?Most Republicans want to burn down democracy in America, poll finds.Yet they get upset when people say they have no ethics and only care if a candidate is republican.I was almost going to repeat the line of \"I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue\", but it's been repeated so often and just feels like a circle so, lets' go to the first part fo the article.\n\n>As President Biden launches his reelection campaign, a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump looks increasingly likely. This comes as a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll out Tuesday that finds two-thirds of Republicans would still vote for Trump even if he is found guilty of a crime.  \n>  \n>\"Everything that Trump has ever been accused of, has come out to be false,\" said one of the almost 1,300 poll respondents, Richard Holton II, 65, of Beaver Creek, Ohio.  \n>  \n>Holton believes the 2020 election was stolen, that Hillary Clinton \"cheated\" in 2016 and that Democrats start wars and are bad for the economy. He channels Trump, calling the indictment in New York, stemming from hush-money payments to a porn actress, a \"hit job by the Democrats.\"  \n>  \n>\"It's all made up,\" Holton said. \"He can't get a fair trial there, and it's all fake.\"There are multiple criminal investigations into Trump \u2014 beyond the charges he's facing in New York. There are two federal ones relating to his taking of classified documents from the White House and his conduct around the Jan. 6 insurrection, as well as one in Georgia looking into his pressure campaign to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost.  \n>  \n>Jury selection also began Tuesday in a civil sexual assault and defamation lawsuit brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll, who alleges Trump raped her in a New York department store changing room in the 1990s. More than a dozen women have accused Trump of sexual assault.  \n>  \n>And yet, all of that seems to matter little to Republicans, according to the NPR poll \u2014 71% of Republicans said they think Trump should be president again.That drops only 8 points to 63% even if Trump is convicted of a crime.\n\nFirst off, I wish they had included more context because this reminds me a bit of a New York Times \"Trump diner\" article where they try to get a \"balance\" or something but just go to these places where someone like Holton will be prevalent or something, you know what I mean? Anyway, it is still something to see, how prevalent this ingrained alternate world really is and how many people in day to day life go for it, about \"it's all fake\" and such. (And before someone points it out, yes I am aware that's' because of things like Fox in those areas, the cute mentality, the lack of morals, etc.)\n\nEdit, honestly, I'm very, very frustrated by how nothing seems to penetrate that bubble, or stop the influence of people who go for this infallible dictator crap, you know, because it has very real consequences and says so much about things right now.They would vote for Jim Jones if he were the nominee.I'm not surprised.  Fox News et, al  has convinced them the Democrats are so evil that any criminality among the GOP is a minor shortcoming compared to what the Democrats are doing.Of course they would. The Dear Leader is infallible to them. To think otherwise is a sin.https://medium.com/@zelphontheshelf/10-signs-youre-probably-in-a-cult-1921eb5a3857Most Republicans are treasonous douchebags.>Most Americans don't seem to buy his rhetoric, but Trump's done a pretty good job convincing GOP voters of his baseless allegations, helping to insulate himself from potential attacks from rivals in a GOP primary.\n\nThat's because Republicans, especially MAGA's, are gullible and dumb. It really is that simple.Until that's well under half then everyone is stuck with him.  Whenever they happens he'll get dropped.Grabbing women by the privates, cheating on your 3rd wife with a pron star and openly being sexually attracted to your daughter didn't stop 74 million people from voting for him, so..... I don't see being in jail will be a deal breaker.Let's get real.  30% of Republican voters would vote for Hitler if he had an (R) next to his name.  Probably gleefully.So wild2/3rds of Republicans would vote for a convicted felon?   That\u2019s great news!   That\u2019s more than enough support to win the primary and way too little support to avoid getting absolutely crushed in the general election.  Historically, when the top of the ticket gets crushed, the effect is felt down the ticket.   A decently high Dem turnout in 2024 could be the final nail in the coffin of the MAGA GOP.Reminder: he wants to be a Dictator, like Putin & kimAbusing women, tax fraud, traitor to democracy, doesn\u2019t trump the xenophobia and racism.Are any of you actually this genuinely surprised?\n\nOne is more likely to change religious affiliations than switch political parties. \n\nThere are people we just fundamentally will never reach. That\u2019s why we need to focus on our own circles of influence to enact change.Sadly, Trump was right when he said he could kill someone in broad daylight in 5th Avenue, and he wouldn't lose one Republican vote.Most republicans would vote for Trump if he raped their DaughterIt just shows how far down the Republican Party has fallen. They can't even find someone else to back other than an indicticted grifter who is, most likely going to be indicted again. A man the religious right would never tell their kids to look up to. A man who has also been  impeached twice and delusional . A two-time loser of the popular vote, with over 60 something election court losses under his belt. A man who unfortunately has uncanny Pied Piper powers and the gift of gab to sway millions into believing that, he is someone other than who he really isBecause  they too, want to give up on morality.They know he's their only path towards dictatorship and complete genocide of the LGBTQ community (and then anyone else that the Southern Baptist hucksters decides is destroying the country).  Of course they support him.CULT. \n\nAnd thanks for greenlighting any crime on the dem side. They can't say jack shit about any supposed crimes. They don't care about crimes and this proves it.But if you stutter a little or wear a tan suit or look in the wrong direction you are an evil democrat that shouldn't be allowed near any public office anywhere at anytime....for the children /s> Most Republicans would vote for Trump even if he's convicted of a crime, poll finds\n\nThis is not a surprise.Most Republicans would vote for Trump if video of him Fellating Putin while getting a Golden Shower from Kim Jong Un was released.If I can offer a counter-balance to the inevitable narrative about dangers and lemmings and how much the country is in danger if he's the nominee, let's put this poll into proper perspective.\n\nAccording to the poll:\n\n* Only 71% of Republicans want Trump back in the White House\n* Only 63% of Republicans want him in the White House if he's convicted\n* Only 77% of Republicans don't want him to drop out already\n\nThose are absolutely *terrible* numbers to run for President. Assuming that he ends up convicted, and that the rate in the poll holds, that's 37% of Republican voters that he'll be missing. Apply that result to the 2020 election, and assume that those 37% of Republicans don't flip to Biden - they simply don't vote for Trump. In that case, Trump loses Alaska, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisian, ME-2, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, NE-1, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. Trump ends up with a whopping 66 electoral votes.\n\nPersonally I take that with a grain of salt. A good chunk of that 37% will likely hold their nose and pull the lever for Trump if the alternative is four more years of Biden. But some of them won't. And it doesn't take many missing Trump votes before states start flipping.So party before country it hurts.Most republicans voted for him last time...and he lost.Shows just how well the right wing propaganda machine is working. They have been conditioned to the point of voting for criminals because they are lied to and told democrats are so much worse\u2026Why wouldn\u2019t fascists vote for a fascist?Republicans vote for republicans period. I\u2019m willing to bet if the GOP endorsed a dead dog, Republicans would blindly vote for it.  \n  \nI believe this is a bigger problem than gerrymandering, who cares what you say or do, they\u2019ll vote for you because all they need to know about you is there\u2019s a \u201cR\u201d next to your name.I think people vote for him at this point because he gives them an excuse to be garbage people in public.Only 25% of Americans are Republicans. This is the important bit: \n\n> There's a huge disconnect, though, with persuadable voters, making Trump's chances of winning a general election precarious. Just 29% of independents, for example, say he should be president again.\n\nBut, as always, go vote regardless, if you're eligible.Which is conclusive evidence of the IQ.If he's convicted of anything they will stick with him.  Financial crimes, tax fraud, rape, selling secret documents, collusion with Putin, attempting a coup....Most of them have been convicted of a crime themselves> Republicans remain loyal to Trump as general support lags\n\nI forgot who said it, but I finally believe it when someone said that the \"GOP is being held hostage by MAGA republicans\" Because whoever isn't kissing trump's ring in the primaries is going to get whacked, wheras the most loyal trump supporter will face some tough centrist opposition like doc Oz did in Pennsylvania.This is because morality voters have noneWe need far better teachers.  NowGood. That mountain of Republican irrationality is what prevents any better candidate from giving it a go.Because they\u2019ll say the trial was a scam.but maga is unpopular, rightNot trueI vote for the best hair dew.Everyone would accept their top politician if it meant defeating the other side. That\u2019s the shitty part of politicsNeither party reflects its base so the idea that \u201crepublicans\u201d have ever been the caricature that party leadership represents is laughable. That\u2019s just the specter left over from the southern Democrat movement that all became republicans.. however the people voting for Trump are driving their 4x4\u2019s through the mud while topless and running from an arrest warrant the next state over\u2026 not clutching their pearls about purity. The left could use some of its old fuck the system attitude as well IMHO. Fuck Trump altogether but def Bernie over Biden any day. Whatever\u2019s different from the last 100years ruled by the business party and it\u2019s two market worshipping factions, I\u2019m good with.Sadly I\u2019m not surprisedIs this poll even accurate?We know.Republicans are the most vile and disgusting forms of life.Trump could shoot your children in front of you and they would still vote for himDuhIn other news, water is wet, and there is a lot of crime in Gotham City.63% of republicans thinking the runaway favorite to be the nominee is still an unbelievably untenable position for the GOP to be in.\n\nThat\u2019s not even taking independents into account who are now about 45% of the electorateAt this point, I\u2019m pretty sure my parents would still vote for Trump if he shot my sibling and me.If we are talking about the rape case. \n\nIt is really believable that a person waits 30+ years, writes books about it and doesn't report it. And thinks now is a good time to go ahead and sues. \n\nBut hey believe all women even if they are lying right?Didn\u2019t another poll just post about majority republicans don\u2019t even want trump again? Polls are confusing.american politics in a nutshellOk, let\u2019s see who blinks first, throw his fat conniving ass in jail and we can find out, these so-called \u201crule of law\u201d hypocrites or the folks that give a shit about each other and want the con man to go away\u2026 permanently.Correction: most Republicans would vote for T45 if he were convicted of rape. Most Republicans would vote for T45 if convicted of a coup attempt.So tough on crime.Yep. That\u2019s why he needs to be forcibly barred from running for office.The republican candidate could eat a baby on live TV and republicans would still vote for them over the democrat.Getting the \u201cmost\u201d republican votes is not enough to win a presidential election.Most of them commit crimes as well, drive like assholes, and cheat on their taxes- this is truly their guy.There is a belief many people have that, no matter how bad their lives are, it's okay as long as they can see someone is worse off. The thought of a poor person getting medical care, enrages them, etc.Republicans genuinely, sincerely believe that laws are applied to other people; Trump cannot be guilty of a crime because criminal laws are not meant to be applied to people like him.   There is no inconsistency in their minds, and that\u2019s why they are so dangerous.Beat me to it.> people supported him even though he had a history of not paying vendors\n\nDuring his first debate with Hillary she called him out on it and he brushed it off as \"maybe they did a bad job\". While it's not as offensive on the surface as most of what the media reported on regarding Trump it should have been talked about more. Peak \"I don't care about working people\" moment and many people barely getting by were like \"I like that\"The majority of white voters voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 as well.\n\nYes.They'd drink his juice if he askedIndoctrinated.  They believe an angry God is going to destroy the country and kill us all over the tolerance of homosexuality, and that they will go to hell for eternity if they don't do everything in their power to stop it.  Ultimately, it comes down to fear.  They are terrified people.To be fair, humans are generally gullible.  These people are just more so....much more.Sure they would.  And those who would be on the fence would be scared into doing so the Sunday before when their pastors would preach how anyone who didn't vote for Hitler would have a special place in hell.  So, they'd line up to do it.I still remember that creepy picture of him with Ivanka....They'd probably say something \"She's not a lesbian!! Praise Jesus!!!\"He's against same-sex marriage.  That's all they care about.[deleted]This is not a BOtH SiDes thing anymore.  The center and left do not support people who commit crimes purely for ideological gain.\n\nSee Al Franken.No, everyone absolutely wouldn't. This is a lie conservatives tell themselves to justify their own shitty behavior.They would cheer it on if one of those children was gay or trans.[Authoritarians don't see rules and laws as a punishment for bad behavior, but as a punishment for being the type of person they stereotype as habitually behaving badly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ssn7o1/comment/hwyriyf/)For one, they tend to vote on their feelings (which are spoon fed to them by Fox and other right-leaning media).And they\u2019d call anyone who says not to drink it \u201cwoke\u201dThe trial wasn\u2019t a scam, but a lot of people question why he made so much of an effort to get in a position to kill people.If Biden were convicted of a crime, would you vote for Trump?  DeSantis?They absolutely would if it meant beating trump.This is an important point.\n\nThey believe there is a right way to live. When you don't live that way, they believe the law should be used to punish you.\n\nIt is not about corrective behavior that is detrimental to society. It's about making sure that everyone fits the mold.If Biden were convicted of a crime he would not be the nominee. \n\nBut I would never, ever vote for Trump or DeSantis. The choice would be between voting for Biden post-conviction or not voting at all.That actually isn't the argument.  The argument is BoTH Sides are not the same.  Biden would be replaced as a candidate.  Trump will still run.Prove your point. When has that happened in the past century?If both politicians in an election committed identical crimes, then yes I would still probably vote for the Democrat in that election. The difference is that Democrats usually pressure politicians to resign when they do illegal or even just morally corrupt activities. Republicans don't do that.They would vote for their candidate if he had horns and a pointy tail, as long as he promised to burn the right people..Who would force Biden to be replaced?I\u2019m glad you\u2019re honest with yourselfThe DNC? Other Democratic politicians? The voters? Biden's own basic decency and desire to see Democratic objectives achieved? There's a lot of things that would force this.Would you just not vote? Do you believe that Republicans do actually pressure their representatives to resign when they are corrupt/lying/hypocritical? Do corrupt and hypocritical Republicans continue to get reelected? This is not a both sides issue.",

Yet, after days of proclaiming that the bill was final and that no changes would be made, leadership caved realizing that without some of these tweaks, the bill didn\u2019t have a chance of passing.\n\nThis is going to like the vote for speaker isn't it?  I'll need more popcorn.The supposed changes:\n\n*Republicans agreed to allow proposed work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries to be implemented on a quicker timetable \u2013 a move intended to win over GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and others who had warned they would vote against the bill without such changes.*\n\n*Also, top Republicans agreed to remove a repeal of certain tax breaks for biofuels like ethanol \u2014 an issue that prompted furious opposition from the four Iowa Republicans and some other midwestern lawmakers*.Yellow bellied flip floppers, weak incompetent leadership, the party of babbling idiots.If you\u2019re not making $400,000 household income, and you\u2019re voting Republican please explain why you consistently vote to fuck yourselves?  Do you really need the rest of the country involved to do that?Gaetz is enjoying stringing McCarthy along.So they had to make it worse to get more support from the POS votes. \n\nThat's just so GOP400k isn't enough of a salary to get any noticeable tax breaks from these GOP policies. 500k isn't enough. \n\nPeople really don't seem to understand how taxes work, I'm not talking about OP, but people in general. GOP policies are specifically written, targeted, and in favor of their overlords, billionaires. There is some trickle down to millionaires, but we aren't talking about people with 1-3 million of net worth in retirement accounts. We are talking about the people that bring in millions a year.Their whole agenda for government is that the IRS should go after poor people so they have no resources left for the lazy rich criminals cheating on their taxes.

Trump has a longstanding and perhaps singular history of attacking witnesses, investigators, prosecutors, trial jurors, grand jurors, judges, and others involved in legal proceedings against him, putting those individuals and their families at considerable safety risk,\" the motion said.\n\nBecause that's what psychopaths do.If only there were a building where he could live for a while and not have access to the general public or his cell phone. Idk, maybe put some guards in there to keep everyone safe?America needs a damn restraining order against him.That's a bit na\u00efve to think an order will stop him.\n\nA muzzle and straightjacket won't even work.He's the perfect patsy for a \"you can't handle the truth\" breakdown on the witness stand.  He'd confess to everything if he thought it made him look smart.Good luck with that. That man can not keep his mouth shut no matter the circumstances.In other words, the infant Trump is incapable of shutting his damn mouth.This trial needs to be broadcast live.  Let everyone see exactly what the witnesses say.  Otherwise Trump will lie about what they say.He said if he lost the election he would go away and never be heard from again, so he had to invent the fiction that he \u2018won\u2019 the election so he could keep blathering.Donald Trump hasn\u2019t known anything else, except to lie, to cheat, to spread misinformation, to grift, and to spread conspiracy theories\u2026 \n\nIn summary, he\u2019s done everything possible to prevent the facts of his mistakes from being heard by the voters.\n\nDonald J. Trump knows of nothing more, then to cover-up his many, many mistakes.All I'm reminded of is that scene in Liar Liar where Jim Carrey objects to evidence and all he can say is, \"Because it's devastating to my case!\"At this point in his trials, he always aims for a mistrial and building a case for an appeal. So far, he can claim the judge is prejudiced against him (because he personally attacked the judge and his daughter leading to threats on their lives). And he\u2019ll try to add charges that these restrictions are prejudicial to the case (although he\u2019s done these things before uncounted times).\n\nThe difference this time is that he\u2019s up against plaintiffs with huge resources and unbending determination to see justice despite the cost, financial or personal.\"publicizing evidence\"???? That foreign agent has probably sent all the classified documents he stole to China, Russia, North Korea, Turkey, and any other adversary of the USA. He is corrupt as shit!You say \"witch hunt\" I say \"which trial?\"Donald Trump needed to be in jail since the early nineties.No lets just let him publicize evidence, expose the identity of jurors, and generally fuck himself over until he gets held in contempt and thrown in jailAnd everyone knows that won't stop him from blabberingWhen Trump was shown a picture of E. Jean Carroll he said, \"It's Marla\". \n\nSeems like signs of Alzheimer's.We knew that the moment we heard the next court date was in Dec. Took 'em this long to realize that? Ask for a raise, bud.Lawyers know that Trump will sacrifice them for his own sake. So they should be extra careful now in this area. He is desperate for an out.Imagine being this bad at being a criminal that prosecutors are begging you to stop incriminating yourselfUhm, if he requires a *Protective Order* to get him to shut his vile mouth, he needs to be in custody. Full stopI wish trump would go on a 60 year space trip to visit pluto<jim\\_carrey\\_stop\\_breaking\\_the\\_law.gif>Can we just revoke his passport, put him on a raft, and push him out to sea?He doesn\u2019t obey the laws, he\u2019s not going to obey  a protective order.Which trial (heheheh) is this? Hard to keep track. Love to hear \"Defendant...\".So duct taping his mouth shut and his hands together?A protective order won't stop him.there is only one thing that will stop Trump from running his mouth...\n\nthat day may become a national holidayNothing! Not One Thing, can make him shut up! He can\u2019t help himself.How are people still supporting this man baby?Ok so let's skip to the part where he (inevitably) breaks this rule or order.\n\nWhat then? I'm not being sarcastic, I'm meaning this literally, what actually happens at that point? Getting his asshole to actually be found guilty or charged with even **heavy** crimes he commits *in broad daylight* is such a herculean task that enforcing a punishment for a *lesser* crime would be damn near impossible and, even the punishment wouldn't do much to dissuade him from *continuing* to break said order/rule. \n\nas long as the price tag < the amount he can trick his supporters into sending him, it all just amounts to a \"cost of doing business\"... which *directly means* he can just keep breaking that order/rule however much he likes. \n\nIt's taking 4 consecutive eternities *just* to get charges brought for a HUGE crime **we all heard and within context, at that**. He's going to successfully block anything lesser than that with absolute ease. \n\nMind you this is NOT to say \"fuck it, just let him do whatever\", no. Rather it's actually an opportunity for me to ask:\n\nWhat can be done *when* he breaks this potential order/rule? He really is one of the most destructive people on earth. Even Fucker Carlson agreed to that.Oh you mean a muzzle?  Good luck. Let him incriminate himself even further and commit even more crimes.Oh Don\u2019t make me sing, Don\u2019t make me sing!trump is just a total fucking menace.Dude needs a muzzle.Like he\u2019d obey it.It's the only thing about trump I like, He just can't STFU and is digging his own graveI mean, duhConservatives worship this dumbass.  If you ever wonder what side is right...this should be a giant flag that makes you a liberal.So, a babysitter. Trump needs a babysitter.The more they try to stop him from talking the worse they look. If the man is a fool let him speak and he will be exposed.Benedict Donald's a psychopath.  He's going to need an actual gag in lieu of a Gag Order.  Lock the sick bastard up.Lock Him Up, Lock Him Up, Lock Him UpThat\u2019s an interesting way of saying gagCapitan El Predictor says,\n\n\nTeflon Trump will slide right through safely with this law suit.\nYou\u2019re Welcome. \n\n- Capitain El PredictoI thought all court proceedings were a matter of public record.  Why would this one be any different?Or, we could all stop pretending he could be innocent in all of this and just lock him the fuck up already considering he's a walking national security threat.Oh just wait. If trump gets found guilty it\u2019s gonna open so many doors to finally get at all the corrupt dems. They\u2019ll have set a precedent and it\u2019s gonna be a good wave to finally clean up this countryHe\u2019s still going to do it, he won\u2019t follow any gag or protective orders. \ud83e\udd23Almost like he should have been held accountable for any of that shit in the past.Is this a Gag Order? I was told he could be ordered to shut up and it's been my fantasy for years.That's what the mob does.Why the Fuck hasn\u2019t he gotten charged with obstruction or witness tampering for any of this shit.And a long history of facing zero consequences for any of those things.That's why his supporters love him. He's one of the worst public figures in decades and it's beyond comprehension that he enjoys so much support from seemingly competent people. But hey, that's propaganda and radicalization for ya.Do you think he's a psycho or sociopath?  I was under the impression that psychopaths are like Hannibal Lector where they have a flat affect and show no emotion.   Trump going into rage fits was more indicative of a sociopath.   He lacks empathy but still shows strong emotions.I feel like if I did ONE of those things I would be in a cell for the rest of my life. Everyone just shrugs their shoulders about him doing it.Imagine living in the lap of luxury your entire life and never experiencing accountability.So crimes. Ok. Do Justice!Truth hurtsWhat did he do?I know what answer you\u2019re angling for, but it\u2019s funny that \u201cThe White House\u201d also checks all of those criteria; the President lives there, the wing he lives in is closed off from the general public, they have secret service guards, and their calls go through their staff members.get him held incommunicado in a prison cell and only allow the legal team access. Bus him to and from the trial like any other criminal.I would personally like a 4,000mi restraining order on him.Deport his ass to Russia.bUT tHiNk oF ThE RaMifIcAtiONs fRoM HiS sUpP\u00f8RTerSBut such an order also eliminates a lot of legal ambiguity. If he does misbehave, steps can be taken swiftly in order to minimize the impactI'd love to see him in the silence of the lambs straight jacket and face mask. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/silence-of-the-lambs-30th-anniversary-reunion-anthony-hopkins-jodie-foster%3fampHey\u2026.that\u2019s not a bad idea\u2026He\u2019ll just get junior to start talking for himThis has a better chance of getting him landed in contempt of court. And/or, having any remaining relatively competent legal counsel quit working for him rather than have their careers be affected by his behavior.\n\nHe somehow keeps suckering some people in to keep working for him. But the more that encourages smart people to stop enabling him the better.Jail would.Has anyone tried bribing him with hamberders, tho?I was thinking 'how's that going to work unless they tape it over his mouth?\"Also known as the Sideshow Bob gambit.I'd place money on him provoking himself to his you can't handle the truth moment.\nHe's a proper mouth breather.\"Mr Trump, can you state your date of birth and address for the record?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course I can.  Best address in the whole city, not that they appreciate me here. People are booing me in the streets.  But I see my people out there also.  Big, tough guys, tears in their eyes because they know this is just a hoax.  A witch hunt.  The greatest witch hunt of all time.  And these big strong men ask me, they ask Mr President, why did you take classified documents.  And I let them know that I, their favorite president, had declassified them with mind, so it was totally legal to sell them Putin. Some of the best secrets.  Nuclear. The very best nuclear the world has ever seen.\"\n\n\"...the prosecution rests your honor.\"oh, he can, his video depositions under oath attest to that.\n\nHis public comments are deliberate attempts at stochastic terrorism.Bold of you to assume that he wouldn't still lie...\n\nDidn't his inauguration have more people than anyone ever in the history of the world?It being public would do more harm, I think.I disagree. Giving him a platform gives him power. In pre WWII Japan, army thugs who murdered left or center politicians proudly declared on the stand that they did it in service of the emperor, which served to further galvanize the fascists in Japan. If this is live broadcast, it\u2019s possible Trump would use the trial to try to do the exact same thing. Not certain, but possible.>cover-up his many, many mistakes.\n\nHis many, many unethical, immoral, and illegal activities.  Most aren't mistakes.That movie parodies some things they didn\u2019t even know where completely accurate. It was ahead of its time. My friends in trial practice still to this day involuntarily scream \u201cGOOD CALL!\u201d at themselves in their heads when their weak objections are overruled.North Korea*Well he is going to do that anyway, the protective order will just make the punishment... Uhm... Actual?  Perhaps.No, he's ruined enough lives already.While I agree in concept, that\u2019s a dangerous proposal for the jurors and families.I'm not ok with his rabid cult harming people on the path.>No lets just let him publicize evidence, expose the identity of jurors, ~~and generally fuck himself over until he gets held in contempt and thrown in jail~~\n\nLeft in the parts in that are most likely to happen.so far, the wealthy can use ignorance of the law as shield against/avoiding justice. \n\nliterally: \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \"I didn't know I shouldn't do that.\"he probably raped Marla also. simply confusing how many, or which women/girls he has raped over time.One of the reasons why the court date is in December is to allow time to sort out all this back and forth for prosecutors and the defence team.\n\nA protective order will be issued. Trump will ignore it. Judge will give Trump leeway. Trump will push it. Judge will require Trump's presence in court. Trump will delay and prevaricate. Next thing we know, it is November and Trump is in contempt, but still not jailed.Duct tape is to wide for his little hands. Scotch tape will sufficeProbably not, but defying it is a swift route to a contempt charge.  Court orders have toothy, and swift consequences when broken....with money.Contempt of court happens and he gets thrown in jail for some amount of timeAnd by not being held accountable it highlights the fact that it was always a lie that the republicans are the party of Law and Order.This is a man who lived a whole life without consequences. It truly is a sight to behold that people still give him their hard earned money for no reason lol[removed]It's not just the King of Mar-al-Lago.  His daddy and his grand-daddy did the same things and, with the exception of a brief jail stint for Fred, they got by with it.  His Orange Rotundity simply learned his lessons well.  Time for a rude awakening for him.Hold rich white people accountable?... In America???  Sounds like woke mind virus to me.Yeah, I hate to think he was embolden by his past success.Almost like he should already be in jail for witness tamperingHe would only be ordered to shut up about things related to case. He can blab all he wants about everything else.\n\nThe thing about Trump is, he can't help himself and he will inevitably speak about things he's been ordered not to.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if they take any action when he does that.Same thing but against someone in the trial, a gag order is against the medias.[I've seen it happen](https://youtu.be/LxZM5wB3nVM). It doesn't work wellSo I have no idea what the law says about violating a gag order but I am pretty sure it is less severe than say giving Russian agents secret intel or illegally keeping top secret nuclear documents and that never stopped him before.He\u2019s actually a paranoid narcissistic sociopath. And he\u2019s got it bad. De Santis is also a narcissist. If either one of them become president the USA is doomed.Rather sociopath or narcissistic personality disorder.Have you tried being rich?He can pretend he's in the white house and we can give him the Twitter equivalent of a Nintendo controller that isn't plugged in. He'll happily \"tweet\" about what a good job he's doing as big boy president and we don't have to hear from him anymore.Arguably the calls and visitors did not go through proper channels while he was in office. But good point!I thought that was what he was going for! Bit of a misreadThis is exactly what needs to be made clear to him and his lawyers, and what needs to happen on the first violation...... But he's wealthy! IMPOSSIBLEWhat if we put a restraining order against them too?They're cowards. They're all bark and no bite. One of the few times their ilk have had the stones to actually try anything, they made it like two years fighting in a war before they got shut the fuck down, and now they're trying to claim that the president who crushed them would be on their side today. Fuck 'em.Dude tried to overthrow the government of the Unites States in a coup 2 years ago and he's still hasn't even been charged with a crime yet for it.\n\n\nSwift is relative.Find him in contempt and throw him in Rikers Island.Hamburglar maskI ate his liver with fries and a nice Diet Coke. The best Diet Coke the likes of which the world had never seen before just like I drank to celebrate the 2020 election which I won by the way I won by a LOT the evidence is everywhere... EFFEFFEFFEFFEFF.There's nothing quite like a good coke fueled Jr rant.   Sure it doesn't have the same incoherent dribble or paragraphs about being sexually attracted to your own daughter like good ol' dad, but it's still pretty fun, in a Kendall Roy \"oops, I just murdered an innocent waiter at my sister's wedding\" sort of way.if junior tweets sealed evidence only provided to Trump and his lawyers, Trump and his lawyers would still be accountable.There were 9 billion people at his inauguration.\u261d\ufe0fImportant distinction\u261d\ufe0f His only \"mistake\" is that besides being one of the most cruel, soulless people ever to walk the planet he's also one of the most incompetent and inept.My mistake. Corrected.It's important to use the word family too. He's destroyed families. He's destruction continues...thus proving he is, actually, and legitimately, evil.\n\nI wouldn't mind living to the age 200 just to see how this period will be looked back upon.what I was getting at is....do you really see that occurring? They have so far been terrified seemingly of even suggesting he might do time behind bars for ANY crime, let alone a \"small\" one at that.\n\nWhat I'm saying is Trump has skirted maaaany laws, rules, regulations and so forth and has never received punishment for the actual things he did in accordance to what the written law requires as punishment. One of the big reasons for that being the case is practically no one ever wants to try the fucker in court. That's if they even get to the point of being able to since he just exhausts the court system constantly.\n\nIt's more that \"yes, that is of course the actual consequence that *that* law states in the event said events happen.....but putting a former president actually behind bars, at all, even for the BIG stuff is seemingly a massive, herculean task and that I just don't think he would face anything past a fine and a court gag-order (that he'll then break too), but bars? for contempt of court?\n\nYes for everyone, seemingly, except Trump (just going on precedence with him specifically)Law and order just means wielding the law as a weapon against poor, labor, and minorities.  The Republicans are very much that.  \n\nJustice is what people want and need, law and order is dangerous to us.Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.\n\nFrancis M WilhoitBy law and order they don\u2019t mean \u201cwhite collar crime\u201d. They just want undesirables locked away> always a lie that the republicans are the party of Law and Order.\n\nYeah, that slogan always left out a few words.  They are the party of Rule by Law and Racial Order.\n\n(as opposed to rule of law, rule by law means laws written to target certain groups, like the dont-say-gay laws)Crazy how my entire life the GOP was the party of moral character. Now it\u2019s laughable to suggest the GOP has any morals at allIf it's worded correctly, that's fine.  We may finally get a much deserved perp walk.Yup. Which is why it's needed so the Judge can throw him in jail for the violation.Based on his performance in depositions, he\u2019s pretty good at doing exactly what his lawyers tell him. The court needs to make the rules explicit or he will just keep pushing.A 3 day stay on Rikers Island should do the trick.$200 says he'll have someone else tweet it and then retweet it himself (or retruth, whatthefuckever) to try and skirt the boundaries of any kind of gag order.  He'd make some bullshit argument that he was just retweeting someone else and not in violation of the order and that, besides, the Judge is fat and ugly and incapable of ruling without bias because of that.Tell chat AI to role play his supporters and reply to himOne of those new retirement or nursing homes where it\u2019s made to look like a street in the 1950\u2019s. He could pretend he\u2019s in the White House and scream all day.[removed]That's because there was no protective order then, *obviously*.Yep. Isn\u2019t the crime for treason public hanging. Or maybe that is just a sick fantasy of mine\u2026Yeah, but in geological terms...that would be really mean to his secret service detail.Ball gag and chin strap dildo.Hamberdler>I ate his liver with fries and a nice Diet Coke. The best Diet Coke the likes of which the world had never seen before just like I drank to celebrate the 2020 election which I won by the way I won by a LOT the evidence is everywhere... EFFEFFEFFEFFEFF.\n\nI think you misspelled covfeffeffeffeWatching him tells you all you need to know.  Hes clearly got a drug problem and they just ignore it.  Lack of family values by all of them.It was 9 Brazilian people. He thinks everyone everRethugs wield the law so they can order the rest of us to do their bidding.The phrase was originally used by segregationist George Wallace in order to fight against school integration.The left believes in justice, the right believes in \"just us\".Down to the individual racist cops. It is called selective enforcement. Sure that white dude is going 90mph in a school zone, but look at that brown kid riding his bike without a reflector. Call the swat team!\"Law for thee, Order for me.\"And women. Don\u2019t forget the women.They were never the party of moral character.  They just used to hide behind a layer of faux righteousness.I'm 57. The GOP had been the party of asshole white men my entire life. Racist, misogynist, homophobe pricks, scared of their own shadows, in love with every war they didn't have to fight in. The men who rule and who hate everyone else. They have never been anyone else. I cannot believe how many people were fooled by these lame fascist fucks. The southern strategy is fascism and they espoused it from '64 on. Moral character? Name a Republican from my lifetime that had that. I dare you. They were villains when I was a toddler.thats just the facade fading away as you get olderits not hard to just say \"the 5th\" 100 times, plus its what he wants to do, give the prosecutods zero info and answer as few questions as possible. Its when he wants to speak that no one seems to be able to reign him in.if the tweet contains information that only was provided to himself and his lawyers, he is still responsible.We can just call them Church camps and advertise living LGBTQ pinatas. They will come on their ownMind Blown.And he never said the magic words \"Coup Coup Kachoo\", so it wasn't *really* a coup, ya know?He didn't commit treason, at least not in the traditional definition.  \n\nHe did however incite and support an insurrection against the government.\n\nThe word you are looking for is sedition.Yeah, once upon a time.   Now we're a more civil country.\n\n\nPublic hangings are pretty much only used or considered for Vice President's who refuse to overturn elections now.But charging him for treason and holding a trial would inevitably be spun as a political act and would be argued in court as if it is debatable whether what he did was treason. Here the judge can order him not to do very specific things and when he does them he will face consequences and his ability to appeal will be limited because of the direct and specific nature of the instructions.You mean the sentence?Just round up the agents who deleted their texts and send them with him.Oh, please no!With initials D J\u2026 what\u2019s the new nickname?Bring out the Trump! The Trump's sleepin'. Then I guess you'll have to go wake him up now won't you?Yep.  Ironic since Eisenhower had to send in the national guard because wallace was refusing to follow the lawful ruling of the supreme court.  Just another example of how magaworld is the Upside-Down.\n\nHe's also the guy who [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7_LG5aB0xs) \"the biggest racists in the world are those who call other folks racist.\"\n\nNow known as the \"he who smelt it dealt it\" theory of racism.That's a good one.I am that white dude you speak of going 90 - I don\u2019t exist to them - old - blond hair blue eyed white guy - I have gotten a pass my whole life and I am aware of itHes holding something light him up!Nah, the gop has utterly lost its mind lately.We\u2019ll see if they want to test the theoryEven if it wasn't directly traceable to knowledge that only they would have, I would think that repeating it, even via the function of a social media site, would be tantamount to verbally repeating the statement.\n\nThere's a reason \"No comment\" is a go-to response when asked about details by people who shouldn't have known about them. Confirming or denying the details counts the same as disclosing them directly.And also cum in their pantsHe sure did in the stolen TS/SCI doc case.Or people who aren't the right color/religion/sexual orientation.Spanky FootlongDemocratic JusticeWe were teaching our son to drive. one of his first times around the neighborhood he came up to a stop sign and rolled right through it, definitely did not stop Right in front of the cop coming down the cross street. The cops turned on their lights and drove right past us to harass 2 brown kids on 1 bike.Brother, i would like to introduce you to the evangelical right wing. I can tell you didn't grow up in a red state. These people have always been fucking nuts. .That case still isn\u2019t technically treason. It might be espionage though.Just an hour or so ago, I was driving behind an elderly white guy, going about 15-20 in a 35 and constantly veering across the double yellow center line. We came upon a cop going the other direction, and the cop actually had to move onto his own shoulder so the guy wouldn\u2019t hit him. The cop flashed his headlights at the guy, and kept on driving.I believe it - I was stopped for DUI once - I know my error, a chat was had and I wS driven around for an hour and their BAC machine was malfunctioning - took another long drive to the next town - their machine wasn\u2019t working either- I kid you not. Ended up with an open container - when the judge inquired about the deal - the prosecutor said arrangements had been made - in court. 200 dollar fine walked - just one of many times - I do have friends in LEO so I assume that helpedI think Obama broke them. Ever since he won they\u2019ve been going off the rails. Trump is just an expression of how much they were willing to compromise integrity in order to win.Depending on what he did with those documents, it might be both.I completely disagree. It doesn't have anything to do with Obama, it just has everything to do with what their base turned into. Educated constituents moved to the democratic party. The only people that are left are either dishonest rich people, bigots, evangelicals, rural people, and the libertarian crowd that are too embarrassed to call themselves republicans in public. \n\nThe Republican party used to be a pretty mixed bag of voters. Trump didn't cause any of this, he was just the guy that base actually supported and rallied around. He is merely a symptom or side effect and not the overarching disease.",

It's futile as fuck, but goddamn this shit is so tiresome.Lindsey is such a POS. Comparing EU countries abortion limits to American without acknowledging all the other medical care they receive. The same care that reduces the need for abortions in the first place. Republicans cannot do anything in good faith because they know their true goals are antithetical to modern society.Good grief Sen. Kennedy is a moron. He is so patronizing to every single woman on that panel.Where is Feinstein at?\n\nToothless.It actually blows my mind how few under 30 people voted in the mid-terms\u2026like, I get that there\u2019s voter suppression going on, but ONLY 25% eligible voter turnout in that demographic?? No wonder the state is still run by a bunch of horse fuckers.I can't believe these OBGYN's are actually saying that abortion is terrible and murder. If you don't understand how abortion is healthcare, you shouldn't be a doctor.Welcome to dealing with Louisiana attorneys that think they\u2019re something\u2026buncha fucking swamp rats.I don\u2019t even think Feinstein knows where Feinstein is at....she said abortion is not healthcare, after hearing the woman talk about almost dying because they would not give her healthcare which was an abortion.Man, it\u2019s so fucking hard to reach these people, especially if they\u2019re fundie evangelicals (read: most \u201cChristians\u201d in Texas). The notion that abortion is immoral because it\u2019s \u201cmurdering a child\u201d is SO entrenched in fundamentalist theology, that you cannot argue the merits of it in good faith with these people. I\u2019ve literally debated people into a logical corner, and they\u2019ll still trot out some shit like \u201cbUt iT Has A sOUL\u201d or \u201cbUt iT\u2019S stIlL a PeRsOn\u201d or \u201cyOu\u2019re TAkiNg AwaY TheiR ChAnCe aT LiFe\u201d.\n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re a healthcare provider and religious morals PREVENT you from giving proper care, then you shouldn\u2019t be a doctor. Let me find out which medical board that lady is certified by and see if they believe the same thing.\n\nEDIT: she\u2019s certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and a Fellow of the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Both of these organizations claim to be strong advocates for abortion as healthcare. For the love of God, PLEASE file a complaint with these organizations about this lady. The only way this shit stops is if healthcare providers like this get CALLED OUT and feel the pressure that their views are contrary to the medical community at large. Same thing as if you find a doctor that doesn\u2019t believe in the vaccine or COVID (and yea, they definitely fucking exist in Texass).",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*I'm really sick of headlines like this.The biggest threat to Biden being re-elected is voter apathy, especially if Trump is the Republican nominee. Between the hard right turn of the majority of the GOP, inaction by states on gun safety, and the medieval abortion bans being put in place the playbook is already there.The map for \u201824 looks bad for the GOP.\n\nBiden needs to keep at least Wisconsin or Arizona or Georgia. Out of those 3 he only needs one \n\nAll 3 states rejected trump picks in 2022 and Wisconsin solidified their Democratic gains in their respective Supreme Court with an 11 point win in a special election.**PRESS**: Stop predicting or calling shit so early -- you look like fools. Between too-early and erroneous polling, and your  \"article\" but really op-ed's, stick to reporting news. Your speculation isn't welcomed here. We aren't stupid, and the ones that are don't read your articles anyway.It's mostly good for Biden, especially with Trump as the GOP candidate (which seems more likely each day). Here's a few reasons Biden should feel confident:\n\n* Incumbents rarely lose. \n\nPrior to Donald, the last incumbent to lose was Bush Sr. in 1992. So Biden has the incumbency advantage and is running against someone that had it *and still lost.*\n\n* Trump is no longer an outsider. \n\nIn 2016, he ran as the ultimate political outsider. He assured us that politicians in DC had no idea how to fix anything, but he did. Most of us didn't buy this, of course, but millions of Americans did. But the thing about running as an outsider is you can only do it once. Now he's running to be elected again, and has to run on his record. And only people living in an alternate reality find that something to get excited about.\n\n* The GOP's hellbent stance on abortion. \n\nThis has *really* energized the left. Remember the 2022 red wave that never crested? Now, it's possible that the GOP might have a moment of clarity and realize how badly this is hurting their electoral prospects, and dial down the aggressive abortion policy stuff until *after* the 2024 election. But it seems far more likely they'll just keep saying \"fuck you we're doing it anyway\" to every voter. That will have a price in 2024.\n\nSo in summary, while we shouldn't get complacent, a Biden/Trump rematch looks to favor Biden right now. Essentially the only hope the GOP has is betting on the Supreme Court deciding state legislatures can over-rule election results. But if your election strategy requires \"overturning democracy\" to work, you're certainly in a bad position with the voting public.>But avoiding crowds also often made it harder for Biden to ignite supporter enthusiasm.\n\nNobody. Fucking. Cares.\n\nJesus Christ, the press is completely useless when we need them the most.The one thing that most analysts are missing is the post-election 2020 Trump is a different beast. The two things he was impeached for are lame in comparison compared to what happened after the election and what he tried to do. Blackmail a foreign leader to produce statements to hurt your likely opponent? Childs's play. Trump 2.0 will literally (literally!) burn the house down.This is the time in the election season where political columnists really have to dig deep to keep their jobs. The election isn't for almost 2 years. These stupid political prognostications are a waste of the energy used to type them.These articles are just the media trying to make hay out of nothing. In a Biden v. Trump 2024 election, almost everyone has made up their minds long ago about the candidates. For Biden, debates, progressive issues, age, and, hell, even actual accomplishments mean very little at this point. It's either stability or a train wreck, and we've had a term of each consecutively.\n\nThe only x-factor is turnout, and the GOP has done nothing but provide reasons for their opposition to show up and vote.Yeah, the deep fake AI's that are coming are going to really mess with elections.Dude, if Trump is the nominee the 2024 election will literally be a referendum on who won the 2020 election.No political race is like the last one.Yes the articles are so exhausting. It is not news and so manipulative.We got a long way to go til next election.\n\nPrepare for the media to do whatever it can to get clicks and views.\n\nLike always.\n\nIn the end we all know what to do.\n\n1) Register\n\n2) Continuously check registration in the shady states.\n\n3) Vote.The article has a lot good and bad for its readersI dont see voter apathy being a problem if midterms were any indication. People are pretty pissed about abortion. Rightfully so.Though Georgia only barely rejected Walker and other than that elected all Republicans including Trump's election denying pick for Lt. Governor, Burt Jones.\n\nIMO, GA is a pure tossup while WI and AZ lean Bidenhttps://i.imgur.com/U2LCtub.gifAlso Trump isn't doing anything to win new fans. Between the 1/6 Attacks, the NFT drop, and the indictments I don't see anything he's done since he left office to recruit new voters.\n\nTrump won by the skin of his teeth in 2016, the _only_ way for him to win a second term was to expand his base of support and he chose not to do that.I would also add that Trump will drive Democrats to go vote against himThe media refuses to learn that progressive voters aren\u2019t the \u201crally\u201d kind. Standing around listening to someone at a podium spout rhetoric *insults* them.We need to know who would want to have a beer with him!Not just deep fakes, but language modeling AI is going to make way more an impact.True. I hoping folks in my state mobilize and try to fight some of the crazy.Love me some Stooges. Shemp was my fave.Not only is he not winning new fans, but he's also literally lost some old ones. By turning COVID into a political issue, the outcomes have had a political bias as well. There are thousands of Trump voters from 2020 that aren't around to cast a ballot for him in 2024. In a close state where 10,000 votes might make the difference, his politicization of COVID could absolutely come back to bite him.I thought the same thing and he ended up with millions of more votes in 2020. I do hope January 6 turned off some people thoughI think the most insulting thing about it is the idea that an enthusiastic vote is somehow worth more. As long as your voters are showing up at the polls, I shouldn't care if they're over the moon or hate-voting. They all tally the same, and there are more of us than there are of them.You'll be able to tell the fake Trump ones because he'll actually make sense.This was going to be a problem for him with or without COVID, COVID accelerated it. When you're relying on older voters and not doing much to replace them with younger voters as they turn 18 that's a big problem. There are people who will vote in the 2024 election who were 10 years old when Trump was elected President.I mean that's down to turnout, in a high turnout election more people vote. Trump's share of the popular vote was practically unchanged (46.1%->46.8%).\n\nThe only path to winning in 2024 for Trump is voter apathy among Biden 2020 voters. Could that happen? Totally, but it's a narrow path.",

Watch S3E1 of We're Here and you'll get a real feel for what a shithole place it is.As a resident of granbury I can assure you they don't like their laundry aired like thisThis is a good read. Thanks for sharing. I can remember, growing up in small town Midwest, going to the local library to read about homosexuality. It was my only comfort in knowing there were others out there like me. I feel for the young kids who now feel so alone and hope that we can work together to finally show love to all people, no matter who they are attracted to.It is a culture war when the GOP doesn\u2019t have answers for problems like electrical infrastructure, school shootings, gun violence as a whole, internal corruption and hate. The GOP is an empty shell of governance that feigns outrage towards marginalized communities to distract their base.>It is an idea that Weston Brown heard frequently growing up in a strict Christian household in Texas. When he came out to his family, after many difficult years of being denied access to any kind of book about sexuality or even biology throughout his homeschooling, his family excommunicated him.\n\nThis basically sums it up.  Use the apparatus of the government to lock kid's inside cages of their parent's design.  Ban books so kids won't find out there are gay and trans people and they might not think they are gay or trans.  If they find out anyway, which they will, they disown them.  But somehow these are the parents that right-wingers mindlessly parrot \"need more rights\".One thing so many of these authoritarian fucks will never learn is that getting rid of books and magazines and movies and music and all aspects of culture from arts to education that shed light on the LGBT+ people in the world won\u2019t stop your children from being gay or trans if that\u2019s who they are, but it will stop them from being your children when they realize you hate who they are \n\nThe sad part is that so many of the authoritarian fucks who do actually manage to learn that fact merely go on to prove that they hate gay and trans people more than they love their own kidsIf I were a rich person and lived in one of these conservative areas, I\u2019d go buy a bunch of banned books and leave them, book fairy style, in all sorts of public places. I found a book once on a bench in a secluded area of the Hollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles, with a note saying it was from the book fairy. Never forgot it.Seems like it just doesn\u2019t matter to the GOP any longer. No shame. No decorum. No decency. They can\u2019t govern so they rig the maps or strip citizens of the right to vote. They\u2019ve long since run out of ideas. As a viable party, they have one foot in the grave and have decided they would rather just take democracy down with them instead of adapting or passing the torch.They don\u2019t gotta burn the books, they just remove \u2018em. While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cellsI wonder if they\u2019re going to try and add to the Ten Commandments next.They don't really care which because they assume there's a difference between erasing us and exterminating us. Just erasing us sounds nicer but it leads to the same thing. They'd be content to just scare people back into the closet/from ever coming out of it. Speaking from experience: Yea, you *can* hide being gay or trans but the act of knowing who you are and having to keep quiet about it will kill you given enough time.Those that take the [The Parable of the Ten Minas](https://www.biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/25.htm#14) at face value.\n\nColonialism has never left.I had the opportunity to work in Granbury before leaving the state. It's a cute little town. Shame about the residents though.I am so glad the kids have access to the internet today. The conservatives attempts to groom them into their religious cult will fail.Yeah. I know I can\u2019t go back inside the closet. There aren\u2019t many nights I could spend there before the darkness took me altogether.Then they'll come for the internet. Again.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*Before anybody asks, no, they didn't make it better.\n\nInstead, they made it **worse**.To understand the headline, they are grasping for republican votes in the house, not bipartisan support. They are still short a majority of votes in the nominal republican majority to pass this.This once again proves that the Republikkkan party is just plain evil.  They can't screw the American public fast enough.  There are so many other ways that they could cut spending and collect more money.  How about rolling back the unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations that the Trump administration passed?  Maybe reduce the military spending budget a bit? Instead, they want to make the lives of poor, compromised and marginalized Americans more miserable and difficult then they are now.  Point me to even one politician in the GOP that is working to improve the lives of average Americans.  It's unbelievable that these lowlife scumbags get elected at all.It's important to understand that this dysfunction is caused by Republican insistence on the \"Hastert Rule.\"  This rule, named after a convicted GOP child molester who they previously saw fit to name House Speaker, blocks a vote on any legislation that can not pass with Republican votes alone.  With 222 House Republicans, this means that they will refuse to vote on anything that is blocked by more than 4 Republicans -- the most insane of the extremists.  If 217 Republicans and 213 Democrats came up with a reasonable compromise bill, McCarthy would refuse to let the House vote on it, despite 98.9% support, simply because it would defy the principles of a prominent Republican pedophile.Monday: \u201c6 Republican holdouts, need 4 to flip\u201d\n\nMcCarthy: \u201cGet the GOP Whip.\u201d\n\nTuesday: \u201cThere are now 8 Republican holdouts\u2026\u201dI suspect that this is all part of the Republican fever dream that brings on the US apocalypse where they get to prove that Democrats are responsible for Armageddon,  government is bad, and only those with an AR-15 will survive.\n\nThey have been looking forward to this fantasy.Republicans: \"Maybe we should change our policies... nobody seems to like them... no. No, it's the voters that are wrong. Let's double down.\"> \u201cI am dubious about Speaker McCarthy\u2019s debt ceiling proposal,\u201d Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona wrote on Twitter. \u201cGoing off the fiscal cliff at the Republicans\u2019 60-mph plan or the Democrats\u2019 80-mph plan results in the same thing: a horrific crash.\u201d\n\nSome things, I will never understandBecause it was not evil enough in the first draft. It probably still is not evil enough to satisfy MTG and Boebert and their cabals.That's the thing, the House GOP can't even get their own caucus behind a debt limit plan, no way they can get anything through the Senate and McCarthy is too unskilled a politician to find common ground amongst just Republicans, let alone anyone else.  I almost wish House Dems would put forth their own plan and see if they can get a few Republicans to sign-on, but it's always worth letting your opponent drown in their own shit for awhile.So we're just supposed to watch powerlessly as McCarthy slams the self-destruct button?Is anyone shocked by that?\"they made it worse\" that's their whole modus operandiThat's why McCarthy and his mouthpieces trying to claim they were coming to the table to negotiate \"mommy and daddy's credit card bill\" were so clearly full of it.  They couldn't even get their own party behind them so how were they going to negotiate with Dems?  His only option would be to form a Dem - Center Right GOP coalition, where he makes massive concessions, to override the far right, but that is not how US politics tends to work in our \"party identification over everything\" system.McCarthy gasping for air trying to become speaker of the house, this was to be expected.Heck of a bad time to want to reduce defense spending though. The whole spending cut crisis is self imposed by Republicans for politics sake.He went from holding a vote today to some time this week.\n\nI'm going to be so shocked when he starts talking about the big, beautiful budget that he says will be coming in the next couple of weeks.Along with their evangelical obsession with rapture and the apocalypse. On brand as the kids say.No one really should.Democratic congress people aren't going to ask for any concessions. They are just going to vote for a clean raise of the debt ceiling. Only Republicans want to attach conditions to the debt ceiling.\"Bad time to cut military spending...\"   Yeah, I've heard that one before.....every time it gets brought up.It\u2019s really not though. Defense spending has been overfunded for years. \n\n\nRemember being in and there always being a mad dash to spend our full budget prior to Oct 1 and the new fiscal year. The logic was if we didn\u2019t spend all the money we\u2019d get less going forward. \n\n\nStill never hard proper cold-weather gear issued to me.Really? The 2023 U.S. military spending budget is over $800 Billion with a population of just under 331 Million people.  the next closest country is China with a military spending budget of $237 Billion and a population of just under 1.426 Billion.  To put those numbers in perspective, this year the U.S. is spending around $2,417 on defense per American citizen with China spending around $166 per Chinese citizen.  The U.S. has had the world's largest military budget for decades.  If you honestly think that it would hurt our defense if we redirected a few billion dollars from our military budget to some of our underfunded social programs to help the American people, you are either confused or just haven't looked at the numbers.It\u2019s very popular to be against defense spendingMaybe I feel like I am doing something by trying to expose a different perspective in r/politics idk.\n\nWe are in a bad spot. The Military Industrial Complex has a bunch of monopolies in quite a few areas. They are really unproductive and uncompetitive. Private initiative to enter arms production is actively discouraged. As a result it takes ever more funding to keep our bloated military competitive for the huge amount of tasks it performs all over the world.\n\nWe could easily reduce spending and cede the role the US has traditionally played in the world for the last 30 years(arguably 80 years underlining 'Pax Americana'). The costs of this would be dramatic and the costs to the US consumer would be tremendous. For example, the Persian Gulf states cannot defend themselves and need a security guarantor. The West benefits by selling their natural resources(oil) in US currency and the simple fact that most world consumers need US currency for the transaction indirectly increases the US consumer standard of living. The Gulf States literally just started moving away from the US security blanket this  last month and it looks like China will take over that role. \n\nAlso consider a potential default over the debt limit that would put into question the full faith and credit of US currency and we could lose our reserve currency status too. Then there is political polarization and a bunch of social issues that plague the US internally. It's all a mess.\n\nTons of challenges on the horizon: the world is splintering into regional blocs and the US isn't able to back up the position it has held over our lifetimes with the power difference it once boasted. Our Military Industrial Complex is sick and our options to reform are limited and we can only back it up with ever more spending.  So we are in between a rock and a hard place. However, the indirect economic benefits of defense spending are not well understood by US citizens. \n\nI would speculate that we will likely find out the hard way how good we had it in the next 5 years.Your purchasing power parity is missing. What China can buy with its defense budget is significantly higher than nominal spending because it goes further. It\u2019s a close rival and getting closer.It's also normally very logical given the absurd amount of money that goes to it in relation to other more tangible programs like say....education.Lmao I don\u2019t need you to explain US military spending to me. I have a fuck ton of first hand experience with it.I would like to see some additional verifiable data on that.  What are your sources and how do you qualify that statement?  While I agree that their production costs may be lower, I would need proof that what they can purchase is significantly higher to the point that they are what would be considered a \"close\" rival.  I'm not discounting that China is a threat, but I think that the needs of the American public should come first when we are talking about our budget money.  Taking several billion dollars out of our $800 billion military budget to help the American people directly would not in any way cripple our military.Let\u2019s not forget we are already untouchable militarily, and that\u2019s before NATO gets involved. \n\nI\u2019m all for us maintaining military superiority, but we need to improve how efficiently we spend that money, and we need to quit giving huge contracts to private firms that make record profits already. The government is negotiating on behalf of the American people and they are corrupt and do a terrible job.There's immense inefficiency and no accountability with military spending either. There was a jon Stewart interview where he put this budgetary defense minister woman on the spot about their audits and how there's no accountability. Money just disappears.Sorry brother. I didn\u2019t mean to offend with my response.You may be right, \"close rival\" is subjective. China may be a paper tiger like Russia turned out to be as well...\n\nIn any case, like going to Thailand and buying a banana for 5 cents USD: how far the money goes makes a difference in the assets it buys. Chinese salaries and labor costs are very low comparatively and Americas military goals are far more reaching globally than Chinas local objectives.\n\nThese are some articles that discuss this in greater detail:\n\n[https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/debating-defence-budgets-why-military-purchasing-power-parity-matters](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/debating-defence-budgets-why-military-purchasing-power-parity-matters)\n\n[https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/how-does-chinas-defense-spending-really-stack-up-against-the-us/](https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/how-does-chinas-defense-spending-really-stack-up-against-the-us/)Lol not offended at all. \n\n\nJust trying to figure out why you\u2019re so eager to get down and give uncle same everything.I understand about purchasing power in different countries, but you have to consider the quality of the products too.  Like Chinese tires for instance:\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/video/cheap-chinese-tires-might-explain-094313721.htmlGood point.",

Power isn't easily checked in this country.Fight fire with fire. I know there are many like me who know he will never be imprisoned, but would settle for him to be so overwhelmed with lawsuits it makes him politically impotent. His need to constantly feed his narcissism is pushing many of us to exhaustion, so we must not give up.I swear there has been a headline like this every week for 6 years.I was wondering what was going on with Georgia.  They seemed to be determined right from the start to hold Trump responsible for him demanding that they make fake votes for him, yet they seemed to vanish for a while.\n\nIt looks Merrick and the DOJ are out of the picture in regards to holding Trump accountable.\n\nIt would be sweet if Georgia and NYC took up the slack.I saw a CNN talking head speculate they might be anticipating violence by those of  us against Trump if he's not indicted. LolWon\u2019t believe it till I see it. Until then it\u2019s just more \u201ctic-tok, Muellers coming!\u201dCall me when he\u2019s being hauled away in handcuffs by large men in dark suits kicking, screaming and soiling himself. Until that time, I don\u2019t want to hear about what may/could/should/might or possibly happen\u201cImminent.\u201d  \nSHMHaving finally seen what carroll looks like...BRUH. TRUMP say it ain't so. Innocent until proven guilty has never meant so much....BRUH.Yeah we got him this time I know it[deleted]Whereas I feel that it's looking just wonderful.I really think trump is less likely to get charged for these actual crimes than he is to get charged for either perjury or contempt of court. Knowing how he acts and lies so much, would we really put it past him to say he didn\u2019t do these things while under oath? We already know that at least to some degree he\u2019s guilty of most of what he\u2019s being charged for but he\u2019d never admit in a public place where everything said is recorded.I wonder if this will further solidify his base and therefore the primary and only make him less electable.It is pretty damn ridicilous that there is a chance (not big, but certainly not zero either) that US gets first jail bird president in next elections.\n\nI mean, would even throwing Trump to jail prevent GOP nominating him? Probably not.His supporters will never agree he is guilty \n\nBut they will accept that his troubles will hurt their victory.\n\nAnd that will always matter more.Trump 2024 is turning into Trump 20 to 24 years.Good the dominoes are falling.  Evil never wins.About time a stupid dumb DJTrump on the phone and on tape that he wanted and needs 11,780 votes to win, what a moron!I always loved you, GeorgiaNews speak. You see the little \u201cand his supporters\u201d at the endUgh. Dark red counties with 300 people are going to come up with idiotic reasons to try to arrest Biden after this. Trump deserves to be arrested but the hicks are going to go nuts trying to get revenge. I'm shocked that some podunk Texas sheriff hasn't tried to arrest Hillary in retaliation.I hope they have an orange jump suit big enough for his ego.\n\nI guess the Secret Service will be relieved they won\u2019t have to babysit him for a while.Remember when he held up his tiny baby hands and said my hands aren\u2019t small. Look how big they are.You naughty boys. Teasing us like thisI also perked up when I heard Jack requested the recordings of Cruz (and others) from the Fox cases.  This could also feed back into GA.\n\nHate to see some of the House and Senate get indicted (/s).It's astounding, yet not exactly surprising, that the GOP is actually going to throw their support behind a candidate that will be in courtrooms more than the campaign trail. Potentially multiple criminal trials. Potentially a *convict* before November 2024. There aren't even words for it anymore.There\u2019s also an obvious obstruction case in how he responded to requests to return the docs.\u201cSome of the documents recovered by the FBI included pardons signed by Trump and Secretary of State Barr.  However, there are blank spaces where names would normally appear.  It is unclear how the courts would handle pardons that were filled in after the President had left office.\u201dStop, I can only get so erect\"If what you say is true, I love it\"It\u2019s not a witch hunt he just choose to get elected to the biggest spot light given to anyone on this planet\u2026 youre gonna see every wrinkle, every imperfection, every lie, and all the skeletons hidden in the closet behind you when your under that level of fame/power\u2026 he just had way more skeletons reanimating than he hoped for\u2026Surely some of that shit has gotta stick to the wall.He\u2019s also got an election to lose somewhere in there.He will also be sued by injured parties on Jan 6th. \n\nAlvin Bragg will also use the civil case of tax and insurance fraud to launch a criminal indictment along the same lines.\n\nRepublican senator on Fox news a year ago: 'they really haven't got anything on him'.Coming in 2030 when it doesn\u2019t matter anymoreYeah, the activity calendar on the Trump house\u2019s fridge is booked solid. No empty spaces on it.Well they better get on it since he\u2019s got a real good chance of being president in a little more than 24 months.Last summer we had the J6 committee.  Then DOJ stole the spotlight with the documents \"raid\".  So much winning.Lock him up!!!While the NY thing is certainly a crime that should sink any political career, it still seems like it's just a minor thing the state is doing as a consolation prize because the Feds didn't charge him during the initial Cohen case.\n\nThe Georgia case is for trying to change the results of a Presidential election, that's some real crime that you can sink your teeth into.I get why you say that, but I'd find it incredibly disheartening. It would be the clearest indication yet that a sizable minority of Americans are some combination of utterly morally bankrupt and/or bafflingly stupid. \n\nWould I be surprised that he wins the GOP nomination as a convicted criminal? No. Do I want it to happen? No.\n\nWhat hope is there left for a country where millions of its citizens want a treasonous, tax-dodging, election-rigging, campaign finance-violating sex offender as their President?> How amazing would it be\n\nIt is sad all around.\n\nIt is sad that Trump has been able to get away with things for decades and it is sad that GOP voters are buying fully into the conspiracy theory that Trump is innocent and it is a Dem witch hunt.  It is sad that so many people will actively not like Trump but will vote for him anyways because he's better than any woke-liberal candidate.\n\nIt is sad days for the US.The absolute best scenerio is for the traditional GOP McConnel etc. to realize they cannot have him as the nominee and ratfuck him in order to hand it to DeSantis as a hail Mary.\n\nHe would poison his cult against all the GOP forever and run independent split the vote which might hand the Dems a supermajority or close to it.This reads simultaneously like an ad from today and the 1950s.Nah, man. It has to be sponsored by Bud Light.He'd be the \"smart Trump\" people fear.  Nobody else currently on the landscape could be.  I hope for the country's sake that doesn't happen.Agree. Omg. If they know they plan to do it? Why not now?The longer the edging the sweeter the juice!> Remind me to commit some crimes, and MAYBE in 5 or 6 years someone will get around to charging me for them.\n\nYou sound wealthy> Fight fire with fire. \n\nThat's how I lost my barn.Here's to hoping he trips up, and lands in contempt of court. That will help things out a bit for the normal humans. The Qs will see it as a wronged man, tho.This is a little different, but I understand the sentiment.Things are in the pipe and moving like they never have before.  Trump is in real trouble in GA, and with the documents case.Yeah but 6 years ago the President residence hadnt been raided by the FBI and every lawyer or person close to him questioned by a Grand Jury.But he\u2019s indicted now. It\u2019s not like those other times anymore. We\u2019re in a new era.But now he's actually been indicted, there's no reason to believe the gravy train will come to a stop now!Merrick was barely ever in the picture. Guy had no intentions of ever actually pursuing anything as that would require integrity\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fHow about potentially?What are you talking about? Are you aware of what this DA is investigating?When you're investigating a dozen or more targets for a long list of crimes, you'll probably use the word \"indictment\" a lot.Let them try they have no real power, and the schadenfraude will be delicious.US 1512(c)(2) states:\n\n>(c)\u2002Whoever corruptly-- \n\n>(2)\u2002otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so,\n\n>shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n\nCruz attempting to usurp the Constitution by replacing the Electoral College with his own Commission sure sounds like \"obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding\".\n\nBut what do I know? I'm just a bird lawyerMark my words, this is going to be a RICO case.Rafael Cruz, Jim Jordan, Marjorie Greene, Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Lindsey Graham.\n\nI'm sure I missed a few.And they call themselves \"The Law & Order Party.\"Maybe because if they don't support him he will run as an independent, but as you say it may also just be terrible planning - they did not impeach him for an attempted insurrection after all.Feature not a bug at this pointThey could in no way accept them as valid as any former president could sit around with a pile of blank pardons to be handed out til the end of their lives.\n\nProbably the sensible thing is legislation requiring all pardons be recorded along with the date and recipient.\n\nIn the case of these documents I would hope the courts would put the burden of proof on the recipient to prove it was issued when trump has the power to pardon.Like stealing a checkbook*Attorney General BarrI sure haven't gotten tired of all this winning yet!About 2/3rds of Republicans don't think he should run if he is convicted, so it will help to kill his chances in the election for sure.Sometimes, people in a downward spiral won't stop until they hit rock bottom. \n\nDisheartening as it may sound, the logical left just has to wait for radical right to crash and burn. And have in place the systems to pick them back up and fix the damage. I know my previous post sounded playful and perhaps a little facetious... but honestly, the best thing we can do is let them burn themselves out. And be ready with compassion to pick them up from the ashes. \n\nNo amount of reasoning, debate, or even emotional appeal can break through self-imposed delusions.> What hope is there left for a country where millions of its citizens want a treasonous, tax-dodging, election-rigging, campaign finance-violating sex offender as their President?\n\nThat the power structure ages out and everyone with moderate to high lead exposure is in a non-authoritative position.> a sizable minority of Americans are some combination of utterly morally bankrupt and/or bafflingly stupid.\n\nNo need for the \"/or\"Sad. Yes. But amazingly so.I see this happening whether he gets the nod, or not. \n\nIf he gets the nomination - anyone that doesn't fall in line will be slandered by the Trump machine. Same goes for anyone that ran against him, or anyone that endorsed his opponents. Either way results in a Civil War within the GOP.Because if you rush and fuck it up, you don't get a second chance.well, not wealthy enough,  to have every prosecutor in the country deathly afraid of me,  that it takes YEARS to press a charge for a crime committed in broad daylight , on film, and he's admitted to, countless times , and is actually on tape, as well. \n\nWhat's his defense gonna be?    Is he gonna play the Shaggy song,   \"It wasn't me?\" \n\ndespite being busted red handed , on film and tape? \n\nPress the damn charges already!!!!!!!!!!!!He\u2019s also not president and the fact that he has already been indicted once should help perceptionaly.They\u2019re moving so fast, your head would spin. No one has ever moved this fast.My personal theory from watching him speak is that he *wants* to go after Trump, but Biden asked him not to in order avoid upheavals and violence.When he\u2019s in handcuffs and being hauled away, call me - not before14th Amendment, section 2:\n\n>**No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress**, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, **who**, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall **have engaged in insurrection or rebellion** against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. \n\nEmphasis mine.Bird lawyers are the most qualified for this since Rafael has been observed flying to Cancun during the winter.This is the one I've been waiting for. He's guilty as hell.I'm a regular lawyer, that seems clear but give me the whole statute, including any definitions.Bird lawShut the CAW up and take my upvoteThe fact that it *could* just end up as a fine is infuriating.Sure as hell isn't going to be a suave case.Kevin, Mark\u2026Scott Perry.\n\nRon Johnson. \n\nAll the signers of the Fake Elector documents...I would love to see them all rounded up and took to jail. Indicted and not be allowed back in the Capital. When America was great/s. They would have been hung or tar and feather. And it wouldn\u2019t have taken 2 yrs+I now think that might just be a brag on the amount of daytime TV Law & Order they can watch and DVRThey want to enforce laws and want order from the serfs so they can continue to steal every single penny from our pockets and give it to their corporate lords.the best way to prevent it in the future is to make sure the American people, once the radical right has crashed and burned, get proper education from now on. Also strong restrictions on misinformation on the internet and hate speech laws>\tAnd have in place the systems to pick them back up and fix the damage. \n\nThis is the key part and where we\u2019ll probably drop the ball.I really wish we could blame it all on lead. I think it's here to stay, though.Ok.  Makes sense to me!Some people say it's a record.It's possible. I've never for one second felt a genuine sense of urgency from him about any of it tho. He did exactly what everyone said he would, stall long enough until someone else picks up the slack and he's off the hook. His only priority was how to play both sides of the fence without getting anything on him. And he did. It's the one (and only) thing he was successful at in this mess.Apparently that only matters if the party of the traitor has the stones to protect the country and/or aren\u2019t actively participating in the coup.I can\u2019t help but notice that at the state level, there have been three Democrats punished by Republicans for participating in protests. Are Republicans going to start trying to push the narrative that Democrats are constantly in rebellion or insurrection?Lizard people require warmth to sustain themselves. Show some respect, man.haha thats greatHahaha \ud83d\ude06  i laughedIn an ideal world... yes. In the systems we have, factoring in the conflict between local and federal control of education, and the necessary openness and free speech protections of the internet....\n\nI don't think any of that is possible. As long as we have local control of curriculum, locally elected school boards, and the politicization of education policy... we will continue to have deliberate abuse of those structures.The reason this is happening isn't the lack of education. I mean, there absolutely *is* a lack of education and a strong trend of anti-intellectualism among the right, but the **root** cause of the fucking mess this country is turning into is economic conditions. What use is education if there are no viable paths to prosperity with it? No one has any reason to buy into the system or honor the social contract, and this is particular hitting right wing people the hardest, who also get easily played with identity politics.Or deliberately avoid in order to exact political revenge and retribution.They\u2019ve been pushing that crap for years.Hey man, Firstname Lastname has seen many people, and Ted Cruz is one of them. By the way, what size is your skull?Then maybe standardization would be the best, or idk, not too knowledgeable on how that would work. But i\u2019d be all for federal regulation (once the political climate is calm) on making sure every American student gets the proper education.There's an argument that could be made that not exacting that retribution is what got us into this mess in the first place. We allowed the leaders of an insurrection off with a slap on the wrist. They turned around and created a lot of the atmosphere that allowed the crazy that is the current Republican party.",

Wade put the restriction at fetal viability.\n\nSo, as technology got better the restriction was only going to become tighter.  Instead of conservatives just knowing they had a slow burning \"win\" on their hands and investing in technology to bring the point of viability closer to where they want the restrictions to be, they decided that a \"win\" wasn't good enough unless other people are brutalized and stripped of their rights as well.\n\nIt's pathetic but bigotry, incompetence, and cowardice are all in brand for conservative ideology.  So, it's not surprising.>61% said they mostly support abortion rights, 37% count themselves as opposed.\n\nThere's the story. There's some nuance to the polling but NPR is doing some gymnastics to get a **BothSides!** out of this. Looking at the polling, everyone wants life/health exceptions, would like termination to occur early in pregnancy when possible, full access for SA victims, total reproductive rights, etc. \n\nBut modest analysis of all those positions shows that people fundamentally support access. Quite a few Republicans, too (but NPR buried the lede).Everyone's \"pro-life\" until it suits them.News flash! There were already restrictions in place before the Supreme Court decided to throw away Roe v. Wade.>Almost 9 in 10 Republicans and three-quarters of independents want to see abortion restricted to three months or less. A majority of Democrats favor a longer window, but even 42% of Democrats want to see it limited.\n\nIt's too bad how many people don't seem to understand the actual reasons abortion happens after the first trimester. We need to do better. Also this is a poll of 1300 people - pretty small sample TBH.\n\nedit: I guess 1300 isn't that small? Seems small but thanks for the correction - in a statistical sense it's large. I was just thinking more about the proportion to our population.We have had them for 50 years. That's what Roe established.Yeah... executing women who have abortions may be a bit more extreme than most people are comfortable with.Let's really let them know how we feel about abortion at The Ballot Box, until they see It'll cost them power, republicans will continue to take more and more of our rights away.I wonder how many people who support abortion rights in the first trimester only are clueless about the timing of fetal anomaly scans.It's like that Simpsons scene,  \"Abortions for some, miniature American flags for others.\"Ask the question should we go back to the way it was before the Dobbs decision last year. We can debate endlessly about exactly which week or exactly which exceptions you put on abortion because those opposed will always be negotiating down to a position of zero, but if you ask people whether or not we should just go back to the way it was Im assuming you would get similar support, certianly over 50%.No we don\u2019t want restrictions.NPR showing off its Koch-funded bias. again.The Only Americans wanting restrictions or banning abortions are the Republicans and the Christian Nationalist. This started in Florida with the Republican Dictator DeSantis.Support sinemas abortion bill!!! 20-24 weeks has bipartisan support!This poll is only 1300 people, that's not enough of people to make an accurate statement on what we all believe should be allowed or notSorry that your right to murder children isn\u2019t actually a right. Nor should it be.The poll the article is about shows 20 year record high support for abortion rights,  and NPR leads with \"Americans want abortion restrictions.\"  What a joke.  Misleading enough to make even FOX news blush.No one knows this better than the pro-life conservative who will have their wife, mistress, or daughter on the first plane to a blue state when they \"need to take care of business.\"Education sucks in this country.1300 people is not small. But i agree that the reasons, frequency, and difficulty in obtaining a third semester (or a second trimester) abortion needs to be better understood.I don't believe this bullshit poll for a second. It's like the assault weapons ban polling saying a full ban is losing support, failing to take into account that people just realize its not going to happen so they think fighting for it politically is a dead end.A 1300 sample size is really good.For the 1,300 sample size go back and take a statistics class and you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s big enough to be valid. On your point about people not understanding enough about why late term abortions happen it\u2019s probably valid, but that understanding isn\u2019t helped when advocates of expanded access to abortion push to allow abortions throughout pregnancy when existing laws allow exceptions for the health of the mother. Why is protection for elective abortions at anytime during pregnancy needed if people aren\u2019t getting them or wanting them?[deleted]Well, restrictions is a broad term.  Both someone wanting a 6 week ban and someone wanting 3rd trimester to be limited to medical emergency/threat to the health of the mother want \"restrictions\".  \n\nBut certainly those groups are the only people wanting extreme restrictions, which this poll would seem to identify as \"any ban earlier than 3 months and any ban that does not allow abortions after 3 months for medical reasons, rape, etc\".Why do you believe that?The lack of understanding of statistics on this site shows how bad our education system is.Yes it is. All polls regarding abortion have shown that Americans favor more restrictions than Roe allowed. Which is why losing Roe was bad.And the \"restrictions\" fall apart quickly when juxtaposed against the exceptions people want. \n\nThe real story? People want abortion on demand despite not being comfortable saying \"I want abortion on demand.\"\n\n**It's RIGHT THERE in the data.**I'm 58 - and honestly I've been pretty shocked to hear from young people what their education was like compared to mine.By design.The poll the article is about shows 20 year record high support for abortion rights.  NPR made the headline is just about as misleading as possible.The polling on this is pretty consistent over time. There has been uptick in support for abortion rights in the last year but still the majority of Americans oppose abortion in the second and third trimester.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ZSQvbVt\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspxAssuming the 1300 sample size is uniformly distributed across the statistical universeFor a single medium city, maybe. Definitely not representative of an entire nation.> when advocates of expanded access to abortion push to allow abortions throughout pregnancy when existing laws allow exceptions for the health of the mother. \n\nWhich is absurd given we already have horror stories about women whose emergency didn't meet the criteria for the exceptions - just the other week I was reading about a Floridian woman who was sent away with a non-viable pregnancy and nearly died as a result.  \n\nIt's not plausible to write laws that keep women safe and ensure access to the health care they need when a pregnancy goes wrong else these red states would just do that rather than handing ammunition to pro-choicers by allowing these horror stories to happen.\n\n> Why is protection for elective abortions at anytime during pregnancy needed if people aren\u2019t getting them or wanting them?\n\nBecause so far no one has managed to write law that protects women's access to health care and doctors from criminalization when things go wrong late in a pregnancy.  \n\nIf they could write such law, why are we hearing about women with non-viable pregnancies having their lives and well being put at risk because abortion restriction laws won't allow doctors to intervene yet?  \n\nAre Republican law makers deliberately putting women at that risk when they could write laws with sufficient exceptions to keep pregnant women safe in the event of medical emergency?  They're trying to kill women?  Or is it because writing laws with exceptions to protect pregnant women in the event of medical emergency is easily said and implausible if even possible in practice?Because important life events that may impair someone\u2019s health or ability to care for a child don\u2019t stop at some magical window of 3 months.Health of the mother in red states literally requires her to be on deaths door- going septic. If your baby has a fatal disease, that is still considered an elective abortion. Many tests aren\u2019t even done until the second trimester, and more invasive tests don\u2019t happen until 20 weeks. There are many many reasons \u201clate\u201d abortions happen.I think of it more as a compromise between conservatives and liberals. Both sides were fine with it for half a century, and now suddenly conservatives say it needs to be 100% their way? No deal.I think if more people were polled (more than 1300) there would be a higher percentage of people that are PC or allowing abortions during the first trimester or up to viability. I would think the PL side would be a lower percentage.What's much weirder than just not understanding statistics (they're really not that intuitive if you've never had it explained) is that everyone that says things like \"1300 people isn't enough\" absolutely *must* have read explanations in previous threads, likely dozens of times. Apparently it just never sticks for some people and they revert to it any time they see a poll they don't like.I'm just saying I think if more than 1300 people were polled, I would think allowing for abortions in the first trimester or up to viability would be a larger number.I completely agree, but I would think if more than 1300 people were polled the percentage of people allowing for abortion in the first trimester or up to viability would be higher.W Bush paid schools not to teach sex Ed. A whole generation is purposefully ignorant.58 as well- interesting coincidence- I have three kids and I had to teach them all long division because the new math way to do it was confusing even to them. And don't get me started on geography. It it weren't for us talking about it, I'm pretty sure they would have graduated elementary school not knowing the 50 US states, let alone their capitols. Apparently it's not important to actually know things anymore.Actually you don't want a uniformly distributed sample, you want a sample that represents the population -- and the population isn't uniform in terms of race, religion, socioeconomic background, etc.Yes it is. Man Reddit does not understand stats or polls. Very few pollsters go over 1500 sample size.Current law allows exceptions for the mother\u2019s health (at least in any state that is even thinking of expanding access) why are elective abortions needed later in pregnancy?[deleted]And they must keep encountering these sub-1500 sample polls.  \n\nDoes it never occur to them that if these low sample sizes were generally insufficient to extrapolate from, they'd see more larger size samples.  Do they think no commercial pollster in existence is capable of effective polling?  Something must be keeping them in business surely?Sadly, you can count a certain member of Congress from Colorado in that \"purposefully ignorant\" bunch. (Considering that she went to middle school during the Dim Son years, it's plausible she got abstinence-only education.)In statistics, \"uniform\" means to represent the population as opposed to askew or biased.Or maybe that's why most polls are curated bullshit? \n\nTarget the community or communities most likely to provide the lean you are looking for, insert poll, recieve favorable answer.\n\n1300 people doesn't represent New York accurately,  let alone America as a whole.Then why are we already hearing horror stories like that Floridian woman who nearly died because she was denied treatment for her non viable pregnancy?  Is the Florida state government trying to kill women?>why are elective abortions needed later in pregnancy?\n\nAs someone who had a pretty severe brain injury... I can say that if it had happened when I was 4 months pregnant (and a woman lol) I would have definitely thought twice about carrying to term.\n\nThere are many perfectly valid reasons for wanting an abortion after 3 months.  It's a hard subject and I don't think there's an easy answer as to what is 'moral' but I don't like all these restrictions, it should be left up to the woman and her doctors.>Current law allows exceptions for the mother\u2019s health (at least in any state that is even thinking of expanding access)\n\nUmm, at least a couple GOP controlled states have absolutely no exceptions in the third trimester (i.e. when they'd be most applicable), and an additional few have language that is so vague about what qualifies that the vast majority of doctors wouldn't want to risk the professional, civil, and/or criminal repercussions of medical intervention during a pregnancy.Because \u201chealth\u201d in this instance, doesn\u2019t include mental health or other major life events (death of a partner, financial instability, any other variable trauma).  Keep the questions coming, these are easy, especially when they are exactly the same as previously asked.No it doesn\u2019tBecause the fight against desegregation got stale.Depends on what you mean by \"the right,\" because the legislators are very much pro-choice except during their 2 minute hit on The Five.Polls have done very well, actually. Despite the 2016 narrative, the polls were very accurate and showed a horse race between Trump and Hillary which is why 538 gave him a 30% of winning. It was just the MSM that was in extreme denial about it. \n\nI'd say the 2020 polling was very off -- but that was largely due to the pandemic because the 2022 were also very accurate. \n\n> 1300 people doesn't represent New York accurately, let alone America as a whole.\n\nAnd yet it does.Polls on abortion have often been consistently off since the 1960's.\n\n>[New poll finds Kansas abortion amendment vote could be close](https://www.kmbc.com/article/poll-finds-kansas-abortion-amendment-vote-could-be-close/40669712#)\n\nIt was only off by 20 or so points.We've been polling the general population on the topic of abortion for like 60 years. We know more or less what the median view of abortion is, and it's less freedom than under Roe. I'm not saying that's a good thing. Like if we passed a 15 month ban nationally with exceptions for life of the mother, rape or incest -- I think Americans would be very pleased with that. But that is still a downgrade from Roe.> Like if we passed a 15 month ban nationally with exceptions for life of the mother, rape or incest -- I think Americans would be very pleased with that. But that is still a downgrade from Roe.\n\nI disagree. I find it to be an extremist position and very anti equal rights. Equality dictates there should be no national ban on healthcare when it comes to women's bodies. 15 weeks shouldn't suddenly be deemed as the line where women no longer have personhood and are now governmental slaves. \n\nAdd to this that the one thing I've learned since the overturning of Roe is there's no such exceptions for the life of the woman nor rape nor incest. The reason for that is because forced birthers want women to have no exceptions. They believe once a woman is pregnant she either survives and gives canal birth or she doesn't. They don't care which is the outcome, their only interest is in taking away personhood and equality from women.Again, that's *our* view, but not the view of most Americans. That's why losing Roe was bad.Nah, it's the view of most Americans. Everyone is pro life until it suits them. Those who are \"pro-life\" just believe they [will get an exception.](https://twitter.com/AlexandraErin/status/1004401076777504769)\n\nAnd, yeah, losing Roe to Casey was bad.",

Now independent political organizations - superPACs - can spend infinite amounts of money on political ads. As much as they're required to publicly report their donors, there's a work around. Many donors will give their money to a 501(c)4 - an officially non-political entity with no obligation to publicly disclose its donors - then the 501(c)4 will donate to the superPAC. The superPAC only has to report the 501(c)4 as the donor.",

The only reason why this guy even has a shot is because of religious extremists/bigots froth at the mouth of the thought of pushing their views on everybody. He\u2019s such a failure as the governor of florida it\u2019ll show a lot more on the national stage.He Jebbed himselfHe's also not a likable guy.

But he doesn't have the mass appeal to draw swing voters (if there are any left).\n\nHe MAY have enough appeal to draw out Republican voters in 2024 to \"retake the country\", especially if Dems and their voters get complacent.Love him or hate him, Trump is a savant with connecting with people. It's an odd sort of charisma.\n\nMeatball McPuddingfingers has the charisma of a litterbox that needs cleaned out.*Jeb!*Zero chance this guy beats Trump. Unfortunately our elections are largely popularity contests. Essentially nothing more than a vote for prom king and queen. In that contest, the guy with no personality, no charisma or charm, who lacks general social skills loses every time. The more DeSantis is in circulation, the more visible his shortcomings. The early MAGA PAC ads have been absolutely brutal take-downs.This guy has a personality like a moth compared to JebJust the title of this article must be a deathblow to neo-jeb\u2019s ego. Love to see it.I don\u2019t remember Jeb being a total nut job.  This guy is not a like-able person and makes for it by being a bully.

If any other R is forced to take the nom, Biden stomps them.Honestly, I don't understand why he didn't just make a deal with Trump to be his VP choice in the 2024 election. It makes little sense, as becoming Trump's enemy only killed off his political chances nationally - and thankfully reduced him to a mere lightweight politically.Unless the Republican Party changes its primaries to be be proportional instead of winner take all, and/or use ranked choice, and/or cut the field down to at most 3 total candidates, Trump will be their nominee.\n\nSome or all of those changes have to be in place to make going after Trump for being a loser, a liar, and a liability a feasible campaign strategy.  If there's a decent quality Republican candidate pointing out that after 2016, Republicans lost or underperformed in every election, that person could get the 60-65% or so of the Republican Primary vote that's not MAGA.  The vote that was split across like 6 or 7 candidates in 2016.\n\nI don't actually see a non MAGA candidate in the offing right now, but it's still sort of early.\n\nI think Biden might lose to someone that's not Trump.  But I don't know if there are any good Republican candidates who will step up while Trump is in the mix.Hahaha!! I just used this analogy with friends last week. So true. He is flaming out.But the NYPost said he was the future. LolRon!Pacmandying.mp3I can't there's pudding all over my handsNot with pudding on your fingers thoughRon!At least Jeb could find a room outside of the Florida legislature that wanted to clap for him.His issue is he delegates his trolling to his campaign staff. Trump is a straight up cyber bully all on his own.He could probably have done it, but the Fascist Messiah is also living in Florida and has already proven the evil he is capable of on the National level.He got high on his own supply and thought he could skip all the way to the final boss fight in a Dark Souls game. Now he's gonna be one more knob on Mickey's anal beads.Disney getting advantage on all its initiative rolls sure ain\u2019t helping.He really the worst Governor we\u2019ve ever had- and that\u2019s a low bar for swampland. The only folks in his cult are social conservatives who don\u2019t have to worry about money either because they don\u2019t have it at all or they have an over abundance. \n\nHow about focus on some meat and potato issues before you reach for the puddin\u2019, Ronald?A good ol classic JebbingYou never want to go full Jeb.\u201cHe been *Jebbed*!\u201dJebbed:\n\nWhen a Governor of Florida who tried to help a Republican President steal an election gets humiliated and beaten by trump on the national stage.Look at Trump. People who define themselves by who they hate, will vote for people who hate the \"right\" groups. Since Trump has poisoned his base against news, even with Fox trying to prop him up, he won't win them over. Cult leaders don't share power and you can't turn the cult against its leader and keep the cult going.he doesn't have to actually be likeable at all.  for the type of people that would be willing to support him in the first place, if people on \"the other side\" find him unlikeable, then they convince themselves that they do find him likeable.Look, I\u2019m a Democrat. In Orlando in 2004 my house was hit by THREE hurricanes and through it all I felt like Jeb\u2019s disaster response was intelligent and geared toward helping people.\n\nLater look at how DeSantis handled COVID (cook the statistics, tell everyone to not wear masks or get vaccinated, make backroom deals to sell Regeneron) and Hurricane Ian (use suspension of highway tolls as a campaign ad) and you can see that there is no desire whatsoever to effectively govern the state. He\u2019s never here, and when you do see him it\u2019s when he\u2019s picking fights with Disney and whining about wokeness.\n\nThis isn\u2019t partisan, it\u2019s the objective truth. Ron DeSantis just wants power. He has no interest in serving the people.Extremely rare Jacobin W.He doesn\u2019t have much appeal inside Florida either, he wins because the Democratic Party is hilariously incompetent here.He won\u2019t be the candidate unless Trump folds somehow. \n\nTrump has the edge in the primaries, that edge increases with each new entrant to the race. MAGA loons are the largest chunk of the GOP base, and most active, so they\u2019re still the ones picking the candidate. As we\u2019ve seen- Ron ain\u2019t out-MAGA-ing Trump. And to boot he lacks the flare or personality (also doesn\u2019t seem so strong lately when it comes to rhetoric or policy- the \u201cwoke\u201d wars are already tired).\n\nAND the more people (even Republicans) see of Meatball Ron, the less they like him. It turns out DESANTIS basically was just a place holder for a \u201cTrump but not Trump\u201d candidate, before people really heard him talk or before he\u2019d done much other than win on a historically bad night for Republicans. Well, the shine is gone and none of these ridiculous people are going to be palatable to the majority of voting Americans in 2024.\n\nI think the only thing that can fuck this up for Biden is a major health issue/gaffe related to health.He doesn\u2019t have appeal in florida either. The media likes to boast about how much of a win he got last and always fails to mention that his democrat opponent was our former Republican governor. Democrats didn\u2019t have a candidate to vote for.And got out hispanic friends, \u00a1Jeb!Ron!Honestly the 6-week abortion ban I think was his Death Knell. Floridians were fine with 20 weeks and 16 was begrudgingly acceptable as a dirty lib, but this 6-week has moderate conservatives aghast here.A cardboard representation of Biden could beat a Nikki Haley.Brilliant.Jeb\u2026 Ron\u2026 Jonny Reb?Jeb bush for some reason was the guest speaker at my graduation ceremony for the university of South Carolina in 2014. Everyone was like why the f did we get Jeb bushWell that was certainly an image I won't soon forgetYeah, I\u2019ve had family in Florida for generations. Some that owned land where Disney was before it was even disney, they\u2019ve been there a long time.  I\u2019ve been told he is hands down the worst and most unqualified you\u2019ve ever had which as you said is pretty damn impressive of a feat. I cannot fathom how he could even sniff success on a national levelI really thought Rick Scott was the bottom of the barrel, but the barrel had a false bottom.To some extent, Trump was successful in part because he is very likable to his base. They absolutely love the guy in a way that Romney or few other Republicans have ever achieved. There are an endless parade of Trump wannabes but none of them have captured the same level of devotion. Despite having essentially the exact same agenda the right has never lined up to jerk off Ted Cruz in the same way they do Trump. Republicans will rally to the eventual nominee but I doubt anyone but Trump will get the same level of devotion.Wait\u2026 we have a Democratic Party?Tbf, a cardboard representation of Nikki Haley could beat Nikki Haley cz it doesn't keep saying dumb self contradictory shit.Meatball Ron is literally the kid who makes every excuse for why he can\u2019t turn in his homework in time yet has the audacity to be outraged when he isn\u2019t declared valedictorian. \n\nPersonal responsibility? Ethics? Discipline? Where?! He\u2019s somehow a bigger class clown than Trump.There\u2019s Nikki Fried and also this pocket lintSeems like a Trump without any of the appealing qualities. Guys a huge flop and is making the biggest waves he can to keep his name relevant. The Republican Party is so disenfranchised and unpopular policy-wise it doesn\u2019t even matter that he\u2019s done nothing politically aside from polarizing social \u2018issues\u2019. I don\u2019t see a way he can get the nod over trump unless his legal concerns play out bad enough for him. After that he\u2019s completely irrelevant imo\n\nEdit: I use the term appealing sparingly LOLThere was also that old white guy who can\u2019t decide what party to stick with. Clearly the best choice to put forward",

No, they made it WORSE. They don\u2019t care about anything but the interests of the mega-rich and this debt limit bill basically proves it.Get this, work requirements for the elderly to get food aid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nclap, clap, clap.Clean debt limit raise or nothing.From what I'm reading here, they made it worse.\n\nSo, the situation really hasn't changed beyond having the GOP be united.The changes would:\n\n    Rescind large swaths of the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law last summer, including:\n    \u2014 $1 billion to boost the adoption of building codes for energy-efficient construction.\n    \u2014 $5 billion for loans to back energy infrastructure projects.\n    \u2014 $1.9 billion in grants to improve transportation access to neighborhoods.\n    \u2014 $200 million for National Park System maintenance projects.\n    \u2014 $5 billion in grants for reducing climate pollution.\n    Tighten rules for social welfare programs a year earlier. Instead of starting those stricter guidelines in the fall of next year, constraints would kick in come October of this year for the TANF program that sends monthly payments to low-income families with children.\n    Beginning in September, bar states from saving up unused exemptions under the SNAP food assistance program.\n    Make an exception to allow some tax credits to continue for renewable energy. The bill would still repeal the credits going forward. But tax perks would be allowed for those who locked in binding contracts or made concrete investments for sustainable aviation fuel or for producing other \u201cclean\u201d fuel before April 19.\n    Nix changes the bill would make to incentives for carbon oxide sequestration, biodiesel, renewable diesel and second generation biofuel.\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/26/house-republicans-amend-debt-limit-bill-00093872just more proof they're not interested in negotiating in good faith.NO NEGOTIATIONS!  They can shove their disgusting bill up their Ass. You either raise the debt limit or you don't. I'm so sick of their BS. \n\nIm really hoping Biden and the dems don't give in...and If we default they better be screaming from the roof tops that the GOP are the ones responsible for it!The financial chaos that would follow a default would mean hard cash loss for all congress creatures presumably more for whoever would be responsible for said default. Even with the dead set trend of shooting oneself in the foot the republicans have been on it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\nEdit one adverb.Why is the bill longer than one sentence?    This isn't a budget negotiation.  \n\n\n\"Raise the debt limit?\"   Yes or No.These are terrible amendments.  They are making it less palatable.  Cons are not serious about this at all.Are they voting on this today?It's a seriously losing position for McCarthy.  He had to hold strong on \"we are coming to the table to negotiate and meet in the middle\" or else lose the PR battle badly.  Allowing the extreme wing to drag him further right before negotiations makes him look both weak and also unlikely to actually compromise.  Biden just needs to hold the line.The FreeDumb caucus. Who are so out of touch with reality you are better off just banging your head against a brick wall.McCarthy is fucked. Biden isn't going to negotiate on anything. He's already signaled that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional and that he has no plans to abide by it.According to the US Constitution there really is nothing to negotiate.\n\n>**Fourteenth Amendment\u00a0| Equal Protection and Other Rights**\n>\n>*Section 4 Public Debt*\n>\n>The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\nBudgets are for negotiation; debts \"shall not be questioned.\"Biden is probably telling the Mint to stand by on that trillion dollar coin...Fancy seeing you here.This is their workaround for not touching social security.55 is elderly? Why do I have to wait until 60 to collect retirement but you can collect food stamps without working at 50?That's exactly what happened.\n\nThere are some holdouts like Matt Gaetz who are/were a hard no on this bill not because they suddenly developed a brain, but because the bill *isn't cruel enough*.>\u2014 $1.9 billion in grants to improve transportation access to neighborhoods.  \n\n\nlmao. they just hate the working class.If you shaved less than 2% off the defense budget you could pay for those proposed cuts.The MAGA wing including McCarthy want default. The old mainstream of the Republican Party lost control and their majority is too small to control the true believers.I missed that, can you link an article?When did Biden signal that? I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s true but I obviously missed it.If that's true I give a ton of credit to Biden. Democrats are usually the weak ones negotiating against themselves, so I hope at this moment they show some backbone and refuse to cave.He did??It's so tiring having Republicans drag us backwards. Forever halting any kind of progress. Its maddening and infuriating.If we taxed the rich we could remove mountains of debt almost instantly and they get to keep their chess pieces for their continued power. A win/win, but the wealthy as always want their cake and to be able to eat it as well. They will never be satisfied , one cut just leads them to wanting more. Greed can never be satisfied so it is a race to the bottom.Even at great personal financial cost?[deleted]It's not a long shot. We've seen over the past few years what happens when underrepresented groups vote: young people, black people, women, etc. We win. Dems win every time we get the vote out.agreed, getting the vote OUT has helped lately. if we can keep turning up we can see more progress!Yep. GA went blue because of Stacey and her people getting the vote out. It's a powerful tool we all have, but we have to want to do it.I've been voting 4 decades. I remember my mom taking \nme into the old school mechanical voting booth, with the curtain and everything, and her sitting me down on the ledge inside. she said \"little plow_king, voting is very important. you have to do it every time, even when you don't want to\"",

Gave next to no support in 2022 to keep retiring Ron Kind's seat blue, wrote it off already in 2024 as a non viable target, despite Derrick Van Orden's January 6th insurrectionist past, and Van Orden being a library-staff-harassing weirdo.And don't put Sean Patrick Maloney in charge of anything.

That doesn't preclude other groups being focused on their own priorities.I think that they are waiting until the possible fair maps are approved with the new liberal majority Supreme Court.The DNC spent four times as much money on primaries in competitive districts then they did on the general. Several Florida competitive districts had $0 from the DNC for the general election after over a million dollars was spent during the primaries.

It was too close for comfort in several states.Unless they tried to get the old incumbent to run again I'm not sure if they can do that.I'd bet on Santos losing in the primaryNy-1 should be winnable with a good candidate last one only lost by a few votes and had the disadvantage of the district Zeldin came fromIt's not the candidate, it's the constituency.  It's a GOP controlled district, any GOP candidate will be difficult because there aren't many Democratic votes available.Oh yeah, I forgot about the primary. Good luck to him.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*The only thing that Trump is attacking is reality. And he's not winning. Even though, and his mind as well as his followers, he is King and God of the universe.This agenda plays directly into the hands of foreign agencies, would leave the US exposed domestically to political interference and is the first major step towards a totalitarian regime.He wants to make it so he can personally, unilaterally fire anyone who works in the government, for any reason. Any we all know he would fire anyone who wasn't loyal to him, and he'd lie and say it was about their performance.If he wins in 2024, retribution will be the only thing he focuses on. We will have Marjorie Traitor Greene as Attorney General, Mike Flynn as FBI Director, Steve Bannon as head of the CIA. And I'm not even kidding.Jared Kushner for stealing the love of his life?Is it gas stoves?He's gonna have a long list. God help us if he gets re-elected because it's going to be four years of settling scores, and he'll have the full weight of the federal government behind him to get it done.Stephen King?\n\nRosie O'Donnell?This is another reason that Trump has a poor chance in 2024. People often say in 2016 he channeled the grievances of conservative voters and in 2020 he asked conservative voters to channel his grievances.\n\nFour more years of Biden vs. four years of litigating who was unfair to Donald Trump during the last four years he was President seems like a no-brainer choice.My prediction for the 2024 election is this.\n\nLet\u2019s say trump has the ability to run for president (and isn\u2019t convicted of treason).\n\nThe republican nominee doesn\u2019t matter, it just can\u2019t be trump for this to come true.\n\nIf trump doesn\u2019t become the republican nominee, I can guarantee, that trump will not accept this and will start his own party. \n\nThis will mean that trumps loyal followers (what\u2019s left of them anyways) will vote for the maga party which could pretty much cut the Republican Party votes in half. \n\nMeaning democrats will win the 2024 elections by a landslide.\n\nRegardless though I think democrats will win, may even convert a few red states to blue. The actions of the republican party has affected a lot of people, with abortion bans, trans rights, gun violence, women\u2019s rights in general, poc rights, sunsetting of Medicare and social security, as you can see i can go on and on. This is A LOT of people and will have drastic affects on the Republican votes and people will lose trust for the party\n\nI don\u2019t understand how the Republican Party still has any support at this point\n\nThe Republican Party will not be able to recover from this one. Which actually sucks in the grand scheme of things, because the democrats will just turn into another Republican Party with dominate control and start the cycle over againHe had four years, and two of those was complete control. Why didn\u2019t he do anything then?What Trump and the Republicans want to implement is purges over personal and political loyalty.*American Carnage*How sad does someone's life have to be to follow *that guy?*\n\nThere are plenty of people I could kind of see having sway over 30% of the population, but an old chubby guy with a terrible fake tan and a birds nest intricately wrapped around the top of his head just boggles my mind. *THAT guy??? REALLY???*If Jesus returned to Earth and Trump told his followers to crucify Jesus, I have absolutely no doubt they'd listen.In between rounds of golf and watching TV. But otherwise, you're on point.flushing toilets?Hus MAGA army (which would be the majority of white voters) will form pograms and do that Oklahoma county commissioners thing.>Government workers\n\n>The former president\u2019s plan to radically change the civil service is causing \"anxiety\" for career officials, in no small part because it is becoming \"basically doctrine\" on the right...\n\n>...At the top of Trump\u2019s list is reinstituting an executive order known as \u201cSchedule F,\u201d which would reclassify tens of thousands of federal employees involved in policy decisions as at-will employees. In other words, they would lose their employment protections, and it would be much easier for a president to fire them.\n\n>And to give a taste of how the policy might be used, the line immediately following Schedule F is a pledge to \u201coverhaul federal departments and agencies, firing all of the corrupt actors in our National Security and Intelligence apparatus.\u201d\n\n>The policy was instituted in the final weeks of the Trump administration but was not fully implemented. This time around, should Trump return to the White House, there would be little delay.The HamburglerHave you seen the conservative portrayals of Trump? He's depicted as a physically fit, extremely muscular man with a square jaw and perfect head of hair.\n\nConservatives already deny reality so denying what Trump looks like is a small step for them.The Hamberdler",

Just a little bit louder Just a Little Bit worse. \n\nThis is truly the song that never ends.\n\nThe Republican Christian conservative party continuing to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. The peer definition of insanity.Blatantly circumventing democracy once again. It\u2019s disgusting they\u2019re allowed to go on like this.I see there is another state GOP establishment that needs to learn what the \"Streisand Effect\" is.I love this statement 'In a statement they said that Zephyr\u2019s decision to hoist a microphone toward the gallery\u2019s protesters amounted to \u201cencouraging an insurrection\"'...  appearently this one action is enough to satisfy them of this. BUT months of rhetoric actively encouraging violence from the orange douchbag is just speach out of context. What precious, delicate little creatures these people are.Delicate little snowflakes in the GOP.Remember when the Republicans used to celebrate the \"Marketplace of Ideas\" to defend the right of fascists and racists to demonstrate and incite riots?  And any attempts to hold them responsible for their words or actions was labeled as \"Cancel Culture\" or \"Leftist Authoritarianism\".\n\nBut... when people of color or non-heteronormative people want to speak they must be silenced and banished.   Hmmm...One of the most incredible things the Republican Party has achieved is convince millions of people that the Democrats are the aggressors in a culture war, and to blame liberals for cancel culture.What are they saying is the reason again?The constituents of her district want her there.  It is blatantly not okay to remove the voted will of the people.  If this is the \u201cway\u201d then all purple states are subject to daylight robbery by those holding on to power by a thread from here forward.  Just gross.Another politician I hadn't heard of until the GOP brought her into the mainstream. \n\nI hope this is just as disastrous for the Montana GOP as the Tennessee expulsion debacle.Let's be clear.\n\nThis person has been relugated to the out-group for being what these Montana officials consider to be a freak. They view this person as though they belong in an old timey circus or an asylum. These antiquated ideas are still very prevelant in our culture. This is a problem.It's because she said, \"you will have blood on your hands\".\n\nWhen in reality they would have taken anything she said as an excuse. They don't want her, they don't want to hear from her, and they are treating her less than human because that's exactly how they feel about her.Yeah, cause that worked out *so* great for them in Tennessee.She's already being censored, the only thing the tiny-minded fascists in the GOP can do is raise her visibility and make the optics even worse for themselves.Still waiting for the well-defined transgression for which they are being punished, because clearly it can't just be for existing\n\n\\[hopefully sarcasm is obvious\\]Do it, you bigoted fucks. Give her even more national attention. It worked out so well in Tennessee.We are seeing the Streisand Effect play out at the political level - the more they try to bury people who dissent, the more visible those people become.conservatives do not care about their constituents one bit\u2026F' the GOP, nationally. They know they have blood on their hands. They just don't want it talked about.I swear to fuck if anyone left of center sits out this next election for ANY REASON while shit like this is going on...\n\nI don't care if we elect Biden as a literal skeleton in a chair. The Democrats aren't making it nationally illegal to be trans, gay or non-gender confirming in public.The GOP is such a cancer to democracy.> protesters packed into the gallery at the Statehouse brought House proceedings to a halt while chanting \u201cLet her speak.\u201d...\n\n>the gallery will be closed \u201cto maintain decorum and ensure safety.\u201d\n\nIf the gallery was packed with [AR-15 flaunting protestors a la State Capitol Michigan](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/us/politics/michigan-state-capitol.html) would republicans close it for decorum and safety?\u201cIt\u2019S noT me, iT\u2019s tHe rUles!\u201d\n\n\u201cnow apologize to Congress daddy so you may speak\u201dGod I love when the GOP fails to understand the Streisand EffectSo proud of her.They voted to censer her for the rest of the session, leaving her 11k constituents without a representative.I want to make sure I understand this correctly. They want to punish her because she said \u201cblood on your hands\u201d during her time to speak?  That\u2019s it? Just a statement during her time to speak and debate? So the Republican snowflakes were shocked at such a hurtful statements that they ran out of pearls to clutch?!?!? So they repeatedly shut the mic off when she attempts to speak now until she says sorry?!?!?!????!!! Are facets this easily offended \u2026(yes).  What a waste of time and money. Things must be perfect in That state that they have time for this BS.Fascists are openly using their power to kick out their political opponents. \n\nPolitical persecution and a clear violation of the 1st amendment.This just demonstrates how completely broken the Republican Party and their followers have become. Diehard \u201cChristian\u201d Constitutionalists have no interest in defending a fellow citizen\u2019s liberty or the First Amendment rights if it\u2019s not politically convenient. American flags waving MAGA types only care about *their* rights. \n\nThe whole Ten Commandments needs to be abridged:\n\n1.  Thou shalt not kill a Republican\n2. Thou shalt not steal from a Republican\n3. Thou shalt not covet a Republican\u2019s wife\netc\u2026The house will not be bullied. Proceeds to be bullies. It\u2019s always the same with repugsShe's clearly guilty of doing her job while trans.I look forward to her being reinstated and the GOP members who oust her getting put on blast for actual ethical violations. Gimme time to make some popcorn!Let\u2019s expose these Rs like happened in Tennessee. It\u2019s not like these crooked MT dudes are squeaky clean. I mean they could be but let\u2019s take a look & make sure.Isn\u2019t this that whole cancel culture they\u2019ve been whining about though? \u2026.but they\u2019re the ones doing it\u2026.They say she is bullying the house. It is the house that is bullying her. And bullying all transgender people.And she already has the votes back home to be sent right back to the floor while stirring up another media storm. \n\nAre Rs tired of winning yet?\"Why were you fired?\"\n\n   \"They were afraid of my gender.\"\n\n\"That's illegal.\"\n\n   \"I know.\"Doesn\u2019t it seem like a bad idea for the republicans to set a precedent that pointing a mic is proof of inciting an insurrection?  Isn\u2019t there a pretty big case about an insurrection coming up that would be harder to defend if pointing a mic is proof enough for incitement?\n\nJust sayin\u2026Republicans can go fuck themselves.The irony is that the GOP seeks to delegitimize gender identity, and in doing so, they treat the transgender legislator the exact same way they treat all women -- by silencing her.Worked out well in Tennessee didn\u2019t itIt's disgustingly ironic that nazi fuck sticks like josh hawley and mgt can literally attempt to overthrow the United States Government on television and have faced no censorship or expulsion. Surely we can expel and/or censure nazis!?!? Democrats need to wake the hell up and fight fire with fire here. These bigoted, racist hillbillies are completely out of control. Let them have some of their own medicine.Disgusting.  Denied freedom of speech, and all those that voted her in have been denied respresentation.  If expelled, all her voters should be permitted to stop paying their taxes because \"no taxation without representation\".If I voted a representative into the house and then their colleagues decided to \u201cMean Girls\u201d them out, I would be FUCKING PISSEDThis is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/standoff-endures-over-montana-transgender-democrats-remarks/) reduced by 82%.

And Giuliani?\n\nMan the justice in the USA is a joke.Go ahead.  Expell her.  Did wonders in TN.  Turning 2 unknown legislators into national house hold names.  I'm sure that won't happen here. /sTheir constituents need to show up on mass and protest this. The government is literally trying to steal their right to elect the representative of their choice.It seemed like hyperbole a few years ago but they are actually trying to usher in their version of Gilead. This is not going to end well if the people of Montana don't vote these lunatics out of office.This is NOT democracy you fake constitution waving douche knozzles!!!Remember when the GOP was claiming that the democrats were weaponizing the government to suit their ideology. Sounds a lot like the P in GOP stands for projection.\u201cNevertheless, she persisted.\u201d\n\nI live in Missouri, but I would be honored to have a Representative with the integrity and intestinal fortitude like Zooey Zephyr.Don't worry: the 2A folks will be here in a jiffy to defend our rights against a tyrannical government.There go Republicans with their Cancel Culture againI will accept her censure only if the same is done every time something simular is said by Republicans in abortion debates.The GOP has learned its lesson from Tennessee. Unfortunately that lesson is \"double down on expelling any Democrats who are thorns in our side, preferably minorities who should know their place\" and such. I'm really hoping this backfires like it is as well in Tennessee (for example, now the Three are stars while the speaker of the House there is having his own scandals like not living in his district looked at), but I do not think they care. \n\nAlso, \"decorum\", seen that thrown around lately by the right wing accounts, that Zephyr is not \"obscuring the rules of decorum\" and that's why she should be expelled, another example of how the GOP uses these word games over the decades, same with when the Montana Freedom Caucus said she was encouraging \"insurrection\", like how in Tennessee the GOP claimed that's what Jones, Pearson and Johnson were doing. To make holding up a microphone after being repeatedly not allowed to speak as \"insurrection\" while January 6 was \"a tourist visit organized by the Democrats and FBI.\"States are dictatorships of a tyrannical minority who suppress and disenfranchise  population centers.A bunch of pathetic cowards in the GOPThey were looking for any reason to get rid of her after she tried to speak up on issues. Anytime someone shows some backbone, they suddenly care about being polite and rules.>He and other Republicans said the remark was far outside the boundaries of appropriate civil discourse and demanded she apologize before being allowed to participate in legislative discussions.\n\nThe \"party of free speech\" strikes again.Every other democrat in that chamber should say if you vote got this you have blood on your hands.So the party super concerned with free speech is \u2026continuously trying to silence others \ud83e\udd74This is not being done because of any action by the lawmaker (I know they will come up with reasons, but none of those arguments are in good faith), this is because of who the lawmaker is. The lawmaker is being attacked simply for existing - it doesn't matter what you do, what you have done, or what you are hoping to do, you will never be accepted by the other side. Like it is impossible for them to form an opinion on ANYTHING unless they know who did it,  who is in favor of it, who it (supposedly) benefits, or who it (supposedly) is keeping us safe from, and THEN they can tell you if it's good (our guys did it) or bad (their guys did it)I say this every chance I get, but this and their blatant attempts to change the rules to oust Jon Tester are such bullshit.\n\nDoing what I can from this state.We need to organize marches on the GOP offices in Montana and any other state in which they try to circumvent democracy. Their offices, their homes, their goddamn local hangouts. They should know no peace until they resign or face legal actionShould be:  \nRepublicans defy democracy and push to expel an elected official for speaking against a fascist bill that endangers children.Conservatives rail against cancel culture when it\u2019s a person that\u2019s done legitimately bad things, but have no problem subjecting good people to it simply because they don\u2019t want to hear from people that think differently than them.Montana....land of bigotry.Of course her voters can appeal the decision and get her back in. They did In TennesseeRepublicans shifted straight from gay people to the next vulnerable group. Pure bullies, just like Jesus would have wanted.They learned their lesson from Tennessee, they didn\u2019t kick her out so she could get sent back. Instead they are just going to silence her until the next session in a year and then prob do it again until it\u2019s election time. It\u2019s a dark time when dissenting words are silenced by a super majority who is afraid of different opinions.Can the people from that district censure their state taxes since they won't have representation?Zooey Zephyr is her name.For fucking what?!\n\nShe's not even allowed to speak! On any subject! This is a complete slap to the face of the constituents who elected her who are currently not being represented in Montana at all because of the posturing of the other representatives!\"Blood on their hands.\" is the remark they are saying this censure is about?  That is pretty tame in terms of political discourse in 2023... or really as far as my memory goes back.  Its clearly not a threat--she's pointing out that there will be more suicides by transgender people as more of these anti-trans bills pass in various states.\n\nTrump used to tweet much worse things multiple times per day (probably still does on whatever Social platform he is on now, I do not follow)--but with real intent to foment violence against his perceived enemies.My kingdom to the person who makes a supercut of Republican lawmakers saying \u201cblood on your hands\u201d on the floor (preferably in the Montana legislature).\n\nIt\u2019s got to be out there.Really stupid when you think about it.  Did they not pay attention to what just happened in Tennessee?  Expelling her will just give her more power (and rightfully so - she is being persecuted for being trans).  \n\nI know its a shitty position for her to be in, but all this does is make her look stronger and more brave in my book.  They think they're silencing her, but they're only handing her a megaphone.She's 100% right, I always get downvoted into oblivion by right wing brigaders and centrist assclowns on here when I say every republican voter is personally responsible for the deaths in mass shootings, and it's the same situation here, any suicides caused by these fascist right wing anti-trans policies, the right wingers are solely responsible for those deaths as well.Wow, talk about fragile snowflakes. The GOP that is.Facism is here.  The question is, what can we do about it?I'm sure there has never been a similar use of rhetoric by a conservative Montanian lawmaker over abortion perhaps?All because she hurt the GOP\u2019s feelings, too. \n\nWhat a bunch of wimps.How sad!I may be mistaken but another member proposed giving her an opportunity to speak but the speaker said she has broken rules of decorum? They voted and of course the republicans voted against letting their coworker speak.From the party of hypocrites. What Zoe said and did wasn\u2019t horrible. Minorities and POC have been silenced so often that Republicans can\u2019t handle it when an elected representative speaks the truth of her constituents.Watching the Streisand effect in action\ud83c\udfbc It ain\u2019t no fun\ud83c\udfb5If the homies can\u2019t oppress anyone\ud83c\udfb6It\u2019s all part of the plan of making the term insurrection absolutely meaningless. If everything is an insurrection, nothing (especially J6) is an insurrection. It isn\u2019t a strategy that works on intelligent people who can see the clear difference between J6 and what happened in Tennessee and here in Montana, but lucky for the GOP they aren\u2019t targeting intelligent people.Yes, please do it, we saw how well that turned out for the Tennessee GOP>The events have showcased the growing power of the Montana Freedom Caucus, a group of right-wing lawmakers that has spearheaded the charge to discipline Zephyr. The caucus re-upped its demands and rhetoric Monday. In a statement they said that Zephyr\u2019s decision to hoist a microphone toward the gallery\u2019s protesters amounted to \u201cencouraging an insurrection.\u201d\n\nOh, the fucking irony.Isn't this just going to spotlight her and make her a national star?  Amplifying her voice even more.  The exact opposite of what the Republicans want.During the Civil rights movement, some governors were blatantly stopping black people from voting. They even had the local police beat them for trying to vote. The president at the time sent the military to the state to relieve the governor of duty. This needs to happen today in a few states. The states that are blatantly embracing fascism and bigotry.The right wing cooks are really the biggest bigots and undemocratic hypocrites to ever walk earth.\n\nChristianity says love your neighbor, but they use the bible for anti abortion propaganda instead and here we are, they are trying to get an elected rep ostracised.\n\nGimme 100 transgender politicians over a single boebertThey are obsessed with genitalsThis upcoming pride month is so important, need to be out and let people know lgbt exist and won\u2019t take this shit. I expect much in the south.History will not be kind to Republicans.Tennessee opened the floodgates. Fascist fucks can\u2019t handle democracy.Can we cut all assistance to MT? Remove any and all farming subsidies for them until they actually reengage with democracy?People voted for herIs this a case of taking a page out of Tennessee Repug playbook?America should stand up and say noin addition to the blood of children, montana republicans now also have the blood of democracy on their handsMeanwhile back at their church\u2026the priest is molesting a child.At this point anyone who votes for a Republican is completely complicit with the ushering in of fascism and the attempted genocide of trans people.And we Dems didn\u2019t censure Gaets or Greene. Crazy shitThey hold a supermajority, so they can pass anything they want. And that still isn't enough for the party.Republicans are anti-American democracyCan someone make a video of the clip of zephyr mildly saying blood in your hands and smash cutting to people just freaking the fuck out to an absurd degree?  End it with \u201cthis vile and detestable breaking of the rules of decorum must be punished!  Montana GOP\u201d.  The comparison of how even tempered and calm zephyr was with batshit reactions is absurd.For what? Being teens?so she said lawmakers would have \"blood on their hands\" and get potentially expelled? that's not even bad and it's true. republicans have said and done much worse. this is just an attack on trans peopleThey won\u2019t let her talk. How can they expel her?True Facists never see it until there executing people based on their beliefs. Just ask Hitlers followers.She doesn't work for them. She works for the people in her district.The spread of fascism and how do we fix it?They barely let her speak like how are they doing that?!She didn't do anything wrong. I fucking hate this gd countryBlatant civil rights and 1st Amendment violation to propose and vote for this. So blatant I don\u2019t think any sane judge would find a legitimate legislative purpose to allow immunity - these nitwits are opening themselves up to very expensive law suits and DOJ civil rights division investigations. \n\nI don\u2019t understand what they think they\u2019re accomplishing.Pardon the expression, but the balls on this lady! Tras in Montana and elected office? Damn. Go get \u2018em!Because it worked so well before?Ah yes, American democracy (aka Fascism) at work.Republicans with this war against a specific group of people, for no reason other than political gain.\n\nRemind me again where I've seen this before?Imagine being censored for just living your life, and having no external affect on others. And then imagine being punished for that.\n\n This is what conservatives and the GQP want. Why fix actual real world problems when you can just find a scapegoat?After years of Trump republicanism this would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so dangerous to democracy.As far as trans issues go, I'm ambivalent.\n\nBut you don't silence someone unless you're scared of what they might say.\u2026so what are her MT constituents gonna do about it? None of the headlines matter if they don\u2019t do anything. (I realize that\u2019s easy for me to say since I\u2018m not one of them. Doesn\u2019t change the truth of the situation.)They are supposed to be representing their district, not their sex.Montana young people - are you going to let TN young people be heroes while you just sit there? That\u2019s a shame.I feel like this sort of thing will continue until we remove the voting mechanisms that keep the duopoly in place.  Additional parties will ensure that even if a party secures the most representation, they do not have the power to hijack the entirety of the process.  IE, if 34% of the representation is A, and 33% each are B and C, despite being the minority, collectively B and C still can counter A, and keep it in line.She\u2019s hideousALL DEMOCRATS NOW IDENTIFY AS TRANSGENDER. (See how this is going yet?  It's going to end very badly.)Transformers gotta transform Period!!Leopards ate my face.Im angry about this. This is circumventing democracy. Both dems and reps say the ends justify the means. Why is it so hard to leave people alone? Let them be who they are geesh!![removed]How is this constitutional?You can watch the proceedings here 1pm MST:\n\n https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00309/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20230426/-1/46176\n\n\nThey have closed the gallery to the public so only digital participation.Democracy no longer existsOusting her would be good for us. Another Tennessee situation. The cons never learn, do itBecause it worked so well for Republicans in Tennessee right?Because it went so well for them in Tennessee\u2026You don\u2019t have any rights, right when you need them the most, they\u2019ll take them away. \n\nGC-Didn't know that elected representarives had to be gender specific in Montana...FreedomAnd here we are.Talk about \u201ccancel culture\u201dApparently republicans don\u2019t understand what a metaphor is.Why are they facing expulsion/censure?Probably a great lawyer. But not a good enough human based on a standard enforced by bigots.Who\u2019s they think they foolin though, really?GQP: Must\u2026keep\u2026kicking\u2026hornet\u2019s\u2026nest\u2026.what happened last week?Shits escalatedWell at least they're not poisoning their opponents. Yet.....Very snowflakey I\u2019d sayYou can\u2019t ride in my little red wagon.They act with what they perceive is the will of god. You can't compromise or negotiate with such a mandate. They truly believe they're in the right and us heathens will eventually come around.What is a women?Otherwise known as the \"Heads I win, tails you lose.\" method of governing.This is absolutely a trial against \u201cthe others\u201d. If this is allowed to happen next it will be expelling democrats just because of their beliefs.This was their plan.The Republicans wouldn\u2019t stand for the Democrats doing this to one of theirsit didn't work great in Tennessee, lets see how it goes here...Ted Cruz: \u201cYou\u2019re willing to let children be raped to follow political orders,\u201d Cruz told Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas\n\nGOP: he\u2019ll yeah! Completely acceptable.\n\n\nZooey Zephyr: \u201cYou\u2019ll have blood on your hands if you pass this law.\u201d\n\nGOP: Unacceptable. Censure her!Where are the \"Both parties\" folks? did they miss this thread?They have the numbers in Montana.Seems to be clearly written into their state laws. If it were me, I would apologize and move forward for the greater good.Have these guys been living under a rock? Did they not see what happened in Tennessee and how the GOP have been overwhelmingly seen as the bad guys?! Why tf would they even try this? It\u2019s literally a repeat but with someone transgender instead of black.I\u2019d be in favor of establishing a version for silencing political opponents: The Justin EffectLike, they just had this kind of thing blow up in their faces barely a week ago. How can they be this dumb and hateful.Unfortunately I think it will work out fine for these GOP operatives. Their base won't listen even if you scream it in their face.They aren't worried about publicity because the people in Montana and the greater US have no recourse against them.Maybe the goal is to keep doing it until people don\u2019t react because it\u2019s normal\u2026 you know like school shootings.> \u201cencouraging an insurrection\"'\n\nWell. If that's the bar, then I guess Josh Hawley, MTG and the other insurrectionists in congress should also be expelled, right?they are lying hypocrites with no shame. they need to be treated as hostile.What they're trying to do is devalue the word \"insurrection\" in advance of Trump being charged for Jan 6. They desperately need it to mean something small and stupid for him to get off.They can call for genocide of trans people and trans people aren\u2019t allowed to point out the problem.  Shit is so fucked up.\nMan I hate when these idiots learn a new word. I guess it could have been worse and called a woke insurrection.Sounds to me like they \u201chave blood on their hands\u201dI see they saw how successful and productive TN was in ousting its \"insurgent\" lawmakers and thought, \"Hey, we gotta get in on that positive political exposure.\"Bringing nooses and gallows to the capital? Smashing windows? Stealing files from Congress and smearing shit on the walls? Just tourists being tourists.\n\nGiving your constituents a voice? Treason.It\u2019s so pathetic that everything a democrat does, the GQP cries insurrection now. All they\u2019re trying to do is change what the word means, like they do with everything.remember, you can always use [unddit](https://www.unddit.com/r/politics/comments/12zh9eq/montana_transgender_lawmaker_faces_censure_or/) to see deleted posts if the USER deleted it. Unddit doesn't care about privacy lol[removed][deleted]They only wanted that marketplace of ideas to launder their opinions that were so toxic the rest of us wouldn\u2019t touch them. Now that they think they have an inch, they\u2019ll start their real plan.Like Reagan supporting gun control because of the black panthers.Gaslight\nObstruct\nProjectEvery accusation a confession.Existing IS the aggression in their mind.They are experts at wagging the dogWell honestly, the convincing part was already done either with abortion, 2A, or racism.  They just introduced the issue and had their media show outrage about it.As someone raised in an extremely conservative family I was taught from a young age to \"vote with your wallet\". The original cancel culture.\"how about we treat people like... People?\"\n\n\"FUCK YOU, DEVIL WORSHIPPER! YOU'RE GOING TO BURN IN HELL IF YOU DON'T CONFORM! I'll THROW YOU IN JAIL UNTIL YOU'RE EXACTLY LIKE ME!\"It\u2019s easy to do that convincing when democrats are the aggressors in the culture war. Aggressively fighting for equality is the right thing to do. Canceling toxic people is a slippery slope but is generally the right thing to do. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see how easy they can convince people when THEIR culture has been condemned and THEIR mouthpieces are canceled.\n\nAlso if it\u2019s not clear I totally support them losing their culture war just saying it\u2019s not hard to see how they get supportersI've been reading I Will Bear Witness the Klemperer Diaries. Guy was Jewish in a mixed marriage in Germany and managed to survive the Nazis. He records the propaganda which was all about blaming Jews for every bad thing in life and only got more heated as the Nazis lost.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s some conspiracy behind the scenes, I honestly think these people whole heartedly believe the things they are saying.  Same argument about faking the moon landing, there are too many people involved to keep a secret, and most people aren\u2019t that good at lying.  These motherfuckers believe what they are saying and get constituents to believe it the same way.  \n\nThat\u2019s why when presented with actual facts and evidence that is contrary to their beliefs, they completely ignore it.  It\u2019s why they believe such obviously fake or made up claims on Facebook.  Even when shown they are wrong in those beliefs, they don\u2019t care.  \n\nPerfect example is the dominion/fox settlement.  People keep saying that blackrock owns Fox and Dominion, when shown that it\u2019s Dominion an energy company and that the Dominion the voting company is privately owned, they just double down or say yeah right, fake news.  You cannot win an argument with someone who will disregard facts that do not fit their narrative that is being spoonfed to them via a propaganda machine controlled by right wing billionaires.  Conveniently yet another thing they accuse the left of controlling because the billionaires tell them that.  It\u2019s a vicious cycle.Conservatism is fundamentally about preserving social hierarchies and conservatives view the world through their desired hierarchies. Conservatives just have a 'social order' they think should be followed.  So yes, for them any change to the 'social order' or as we would say 'equality' IS an aggression in the 'culture war' as they see it since for them equality within our culture is not a good thing.It's because the Democrats won't stoop to their level. Which is laudable from a moral high ground standpoint, but has had a lot to do with the situation we are in.Dont act like the left didnt go too far with the cancel culture. Need balance.Due to them restricting gender affirming care for children she told them they had blood on their hands They didn't like being called out for increasing suicide risk of young trans people, by denying them gender affirming care.She hurt their feelings.She held a microphone in the direction of the protestors which was encouraging them. No one is disputing she did this of course, the dispute is just whether this constitutes \u201csupporting an insurrection\u201d (their words not mine). Of course, they also believe trump did not support an insurrection, so\u2026Pointing what I believe was an unplugged microphone at a group of people in the galley mad that she was silenced for saying something anti-abortion politicians have said repeatedly in the same capitol.Not just said it, said it calmly and non-theatrically.  Just as a mild off hand comment.  People who haven\u2019t should really look at the video of her statements.  It makes this reaction all the more bonkers because these actions are slightly dependent on people thinking a statement like blood on your hands would be said loudly and wildly when that was anything but the case here.You\u2019re 100% right.Like January 6th, they see that as near success and they backed off to let the heat die down.Where they hold unchecked authority in the state?\n\nIt looked kind of bad, but they're going to hold on to power, so it's not like there were actual consequences.Did it not? What consequences are there? Remember; us getting mad at them isn\u2019t a consequence unless they care.Censure is different from censorThey get voted in by overwhelming majorities. They are doing exactly what their constituents want.Now I'm just imagining Dark Brandon as the Warhammer 40k emperor.The GOP got rid of abortion rights and American voters punished them by giving them the House.\n\nNever underestimate the ability of left-leaning voters to stay home.There is no left of center in the us.  It's all various shades of right of center.You know they've been dying to use the word \"uppity\"...Even the Christian Fascist org who's writing these trans genocide bills told them to chill the fuck out. Surely because it's tipping the hand, not because they disagree with it, but still.\u201cF your feelings\u201d crowd don\u2019t like it when people hurt their feelings.> Are facets this easily offended\n\nI mean they lost their shit over a single beer can.Can we start mailing fake pearl necklaces to these people so they don\u2019t run out of pearls to clutch when they see women with agency over their bodies, or if they see white kids reading a history textbook. Or a black teen jogging. It must be tough being a republican now since so much offends them.4. Thou shalt not hurt the feelings of a republicanMeanwhile, Greg Gianforte is body slamming reporters.They just found their new favorite word, they're going to try and use it every chance they can get.>The Montana House will not be bullied.\"\n\nThe Montana House will not be bullied.  They do the Bullying.Always has been.\"Decorum,\" to Republicans, means \"please shut up while we trample your rights.\"They only care about THEIR right to free speech. Other people disagreeing is an affront to the right they feel they have to say whatever they want with no repercussions!It's a shame, too. The state itself is gorgeous, especially western Montana.Let's be clear, they learned that the general public largely supports the LGBTQIA+ community and moved on to a more marginalized group using outright lies to sway people to their view.People on the left tend to be held to a higher standard than people on the rightAgree her intent wasnt a threat but makes it pretty easy for them to portray it as such, especially with a recent trans person having committed a mass shooting (motive not 100% released yet.). Bad optics that they capitalized on.These haters don't think ahead or of any consequences of there actions as they all think....\n\n\\-To quote the Kingdom of Heaven....GOD WILLS IT!Maybe, possibly, an article about trans oppression isn\u2019t the place to use balls=bravery metaphor.I appreciate you sticking up for a silenced voice, but if the systematic oppression of a minority group doesn\u2019t get your attention then there may be something wrong with you as a person.Are you ambivalent about the father being arrested in his house for piercing his son's ear?Would you be ambivalent towards kids being taken away from their parents for getting them on chemo or radiation treatments?Her constituents were removed from the capitol and 7 people were arrested during a peaceful protest on Monday. They\u2019re doing what they can.They were. They were speaking against a bill that was proposed.Why would you say she was doing that?The Montana state GOP is also changing the mechanisms for the upcoming Senate race and removing the libertarian candidate from voter ballots so they have a better chance of beating Jon Tester.And what exactly are Dems doing that is comparable to this?Did you just fucking both sides this obvious one sided issue?What does that have to do with this story?She spoke in opposition to a bill and ended by telling them that they would have blood on their hands \\[trans youth suicides\\] if it passed.The wheels falling off and the axles dragging!\n\nAlso, it's all the Democrats fault for not maintaining it. Forget the fact that the wagon has been in the Republican garage this whole time is neither important or relevant.fertile and marriageable minors, according to Matt Walsh.Aww look a Matt Walsh puppet.Throw in the if I win once I'm going to switch out the coin so it's heads on both sides and I'm heads part and that's the whole game.Xantos gambit of governanceYou have to be lucky all the time, I only need to win once.\n\nand that's what terrifies me for the USA if the GOP take control backIt\u2019s narcissism. Plain and simple. A culture of narcissism, rooted in religious fanaticism\u2026 which is just narcissism.A statement disgusting in its accuracy, I'm sorry to say> \"Heads I win, tales you lose.\"\n\n\"Tales\" as in bible tales?\n\nThere can't be anything in the bible about trans people, that wasn't a thing back then.\n\nThen again, there's nothing about democracy in there, either.Ding ding ding right here!  \n  \nPick a small easy target to do something against.  Use the fact that you did that thing as precedent and justification to do that thing against a larger target.  Repeat until behaviour is normalized and then target the main group you wish to use that thing against.  \n  \nThey\u2019ve already said the quiet part out loud at the top of their lungs, which is they don\u2019t want to accept democratic representatives or count votes for democrats.  Basically this is just how they plan on fixing the mistake of then not being able to stop her from being elected in to begin with.Considering the Governor of the state literally assaulted a reporter in front of Fox News and that was considered totally fine by the legislature,  I would like them to say her disruptive behavior is the ethical line and then agree that anyone who has exceeded it immediately receives a consequence relative to the severity of their behavior.  \n\nHow many lawmakers who want to vote for expulsion or censure supported the actual violent insurrection in DC? \n\nI actually completely agree with conservative lawmakers that decorum is important, and no matter how significant the issue is, you use only the legal methods available and don\u2019t resort to things like strangling a reporter or support people to March on Congress to stop the due process of an election.  \n\nThis lawmaker did not strangle a reporter and throw him to the floor live in front of Fox News, therefore she is more qualified than the Montana governor to perform her duties.If only there was a system of checks and balances. /sIt\u2019s the classic conundrum where one party tries to \u201ctake the high ground\u201d and the other will do anything it take regardless of the ethical, legal, or moral implications. They\u2019ve manipulated the system for so long that what they can break laws and not be held accountable because they\u2019ve loaded the bases (and benches). \n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right, if the left tried to do this to MTG or Bobo they\u2019d screaming from the top of every platform they could bitching about the inequalities and discrimination. Both of those lawmakers are grifters and we all know it. They (the GOP) knows it, as well. It\u2019s disgusting how far this nation has fallen. \n\nThe biggest difference between the US, Russia, and China is that our PR team did a pretty good job for a long time with their propaganda. The veil has lifted though and the similarities are coming to light rapidly.That's about the most harmful thing she could have done, honestly.  Especially with how outrageous their demand was.\n\nBringing this kind of thing to national attention is itself a pretty significant good, and submitting to abusers generally doesn't lead to a productive working relationship anyway.The GOP voters generally do live under a rock, yeah. The rock is right wing media, and they feel warm, safe, and flattered under there. \n\nMy dad has no idea what happened in Tennessee except the part where the democrats were very loud and scary and got kicked out. He sees it as a victory against woke (brown/black/democratic) reps/worldview.The MAGAs are following the same playbook in all the red states in many ways.\n\nIn Indiana, they are working on\\\\just passed a law about no gender discussions in school k-3, just like Florida.  Don't worry its just k-3, nobody should be teaching that at that level, just like Florida.  Florida just expanded theirs to k-12 (all school ages) but don't worry Indiana, that won't happen here.  Just like Florida.\n\nThey start small, with dubious plausibility, then once established and the media moves on they push it all the way through.  Understandably, everyone hates Desantis for this but I haven't seen any recent articles about Holcomb.  Hint:  one is fighting trump, the other quietly following orders.Well they try it because its creep of facism. Every attempt is a success for facism. Every time you try there is a \"chance\" that it will succeed once it does. You have established precedent.That you can use and to grow it.\n\nIts why they have redoubled efforts supreme court gave them some ground with abortion. Now its time for facist to go crazy with legislation on it so that were to busy stopping whats going on now to focus on rolling back the big one. And its across the board throwing stuff to see what sticks its and if it doesn't stick it still used up resources of people fighting it. And its still another step closer to their goal.>Did they not see what happened in Tennessee and how the GOP have been overwhelmingly seen as the bad guys?!\n\nThey are not overwhelmingly seen as bad guys in Tennessee, they are overwhelmingly voted into office.\n\n>Why tf would they even try this? It\u2019s literally a repeat but with someone transgender instead of black\n\nBecause its what their voters want.Its Montana, so would probably not have much of an impact on the GOP.Because districts in these deep red states are so thoroughly gerrymandered, that the only danger they face is a challenge from the Right. So they keep electing the person who can say and do the absolute craziest shit possible, and we end up with the current GOP. These fanatics don't understand that culture war nonsense is to just help get elected - you're not actually supposed to DO it. \n\nThey're the dog that caught the truck and they have no idea what to do now.They haven\u2019t been living under a rock. They\u2019ve been living in the middle of BFE.This is Montana, where their biggest complaint is how all of the liberal Californians are ruining their state.  Note, those liberals are the deeply conservative Californians fleeing California because of the liberals there.  I wouldn't expect a backlash.They're testing systems to see where they can find a weakness to exploit.  Once they find an attack that works, they'll replicate it to the other red supermajority states.It was a TN GOP problem, not the MT GOP's.\n\nFor all their talk of complete party unity from the National party on down, they sure like to believe the state parties can compartmentalize themselves.It was covered VERY differently on conservative media. Those closest to the fiasco know how bad it was, but those who only know about it based on what Fox News and others like them reported heard about a  \u201cviolent Dem insurrection put down by victorious, 2nd Amendment-defending Republicans.\u201d\n\nThere was not any whiff of \u201cdefeat\u201d reported on afterwards, the reinstatement. Their news doesn\u2019t work that way. The moment something takes a turn they absolutely can\u2019t spin no matter what, they move on.\n\nThere is a non-zero chance that the legislature in Montana has no actual idea of how much of a clusterfuck it was for the TN GOP. So many true-believing conservative-news-bubble-babies have been elected and are actually SERVING now; people who never knew that it was all a con, like the original generation of GOP officials who first made that deal with the devil.\n\nIn short, Montana Republicans may only have the Tucker Carlson version of the story in their heads. That\u2019s one silver lining to their bubble \u2014 it makes them oblivious to their own weakness.It\u2019s not dumb nor hateful it\u2019s simply pure ignorance and boundary testing, they\u2019re  like a child trying to get their way. what they do is take it as far as people will let them because their morality consists of physical barriers like safety gates to a toddler.\nThey just simply have no moral compass besides what others tell them and when they run out of authority to tell them how to behave they just go nuts. These people are the reason we have to write things down to create the moral boundaries of human agency as physical consequences and they have taken control, that is terrifying to me.They're just trying to co-opt the phrase and dilute it.But according to them, they incite the right kind of insurrection, ans she's inciting the wrong sort of insurrection... Because, according to the GOP, trans kids and adults are the cause of everything wrong with the USA.\n\nSeriously... Fuck the Montana GOP.They don\u2019t actually believe words have meaning.What's the phrase? \"Every accusation from the GOP is a confession\"? Sounds about right to me.Anyone that doesn't recognize this as genocide doesn't know what genocide is.believe it or not.... straight to jail.\nundercook fish? straight to jail,\novercook fish? jail.Very telling that deleted dude is most active in r/iamatotalpieceofshitHere comes Reddit's medical expert.the ones censoring a law makerComplaining isn\u2019t snowflakeish. Being afraid of everything is though. It\u2019s a quintessential conservative trait.Seems like the GOP for not willing to hear her out - they don't like what she has to say so they shut her up or kick her out? It's laughable.Cause and effect. You\u2019re trying to call out the effect as if that solves the problem.[removed]Wash Rinse Repeat ad nauseam\u2026And making them remotely uncomfortable. They can't tolerate it.Me, existing in the world.\n\nConservatives: Ugh why do you have to push your lifestyle on everyone.I think that\u2019s what it became, at least temporarily, during the Trump era of the party, and we may still be seeing it. They of course lost control during the Tea Party era as well. But the GOP walks a tightrope on control and I have to bet that it will recover again.That\u2019s fair. I thought of *How the South Won the Civil War* by Heather Cox Richardson as I wrote that post, which says that, realistically, right-wing oligarchs in this country have been manipulating huge swaths of the country in a similar way since the founding. But yeah, abortion and gun-ownership are probably the the most \u201ccore\u201d of the \u201cus vs them\u201d issues today and the LGBTQ part is just a branch from there.Christ died because he said we should treat people like people. Using his name to denigrate and dehumanize others is wrong on so many levels. I'm tired of the hypocrisy. Of the lack of self awareness.I\u2019m amazed they took the party of small government, freedom of speech, individual freedom and rights, and turned it into the party of controlling genitals.> You cannot win an argument with someone who will disregard facts that do not fit their narrative that is being spoonfed to them via a propaganda machine controlled by right wing billionaires.\n\nGotta be honest, but that's why I don't even try to converse with them any more. How do you hold an adult conversation with someone who gets to deny factual evidence at whim, and gets to present opinions and rumor as \"cold hard facts\"? You can't use logic to unseat someone from a position that they didn't use logic to get into.They DON\u2019T actually believe half this stuff.  They just like the messaging.  But they do not act in good faith.  Their platform is to destroy America from within so the public demands a dictator to solve everything.\n\nEvangelicals preach this stuff.>So yes, for them any change to the 'social order'\n\nIt's not just \"for them\", it's objective. Advocating for or initiating change makes you the aggressor in a culture war.\n\nIf you want to say there is nothing wrong with change, then fine, there is nothing inherently wrong with change (because it depends on the change). But own it - don't gaslight and say \"no, the conservatives are the *real* aggressors\" because that is just objectively untrue.Cancel culture isn't a thing.It\u2019s called being held responsible. That\u2019s always been a thing.\u201cMaybe you should have stopped calling out all the bigotry if you didn\u2019t want me to become a Nazi.\u201dWhat cancel culture?Care to actually give an example? Or are you just gonna vaguely gesture at nothing in particular.Let's grant that to be the case. Does that warrant elected leaders being expelled because some people on the left tried to cancel people in society?Which is so sick because state GOPs across the country are actively and all but openly working towards trans genocide. Florida is trying to instate the death penalty for being trans (classifying drag and \u201cNot dressing as your biological sex near children\u201d as sexual assault, then upgrading the penalty for CSA to include capital punishment) as well as giving the state the power to abduct trans children out of their homes and wrest guardianship of them away from their parents. \n\nIt is as close as we have ever been to rounding up trans people and summarily executing them. I am not kidding when I say that they are hungry for trans genocide, they fucking mean itWe need to start talking about Leelah Alcorn againBy existingIt's amazing how the new Republican play is equating any oppositional protest as an insurrection. All in an attempt to downplay the events of January 6th.Yet.  I wish we stopped looking for resolutions within the span of time of a law and order episode.  I guarantee barely anyone in however many months time is going to cross check who is voted out in Tennessee so this comment will seem right even if later proven wrong.They have more name recognition now, wider reach, more influence. They\u2019ve been invited to the White House to talk gun control. No way that happens without having been expelled first.Well the two people kicked out were reappointed (and became known nationally for being standup guys) and one of the guys in charge was ousted IIRC. I don\u2019t think that would have happened without national attention.Censure is punishment and she's already being punished by way of censorship. What are they going to do besides take her off of committees (meaningless when the session ends this weekend)? Make her unable to vote (meaningless in a supermajority)? Fine her (she'll 100% have donations galore)? \n\nLol.they have stripped away jobs, healthcare, and education from their constituents\u2026of course constituents are voting against their best interests they have nothing but religion and opiates.Yes republican voters are idiots. This isnt a new talking point.The 2022 election was supposed to be a red wave. It was not. Republicans failed to take the Senate and *just barely* won the House. Every vote matters - we agree on that, I'm sure - but 2022 wasn't a mass staying- home of left-leaning voters.*Republicans did another bad thing. Perfect, another chance to attack progressives and the left.*The GOP won the house through gerrymandering. The fact that they barely won on the maps they drew shows how unpopular they are.Balls are very brave. They are so delicate yet they just hang out there unprotected.This, like... I do really appreciate the support from cis people, but am trying to hold my tongue at times because some of the efforts to support are more than a little tone deaf. Just shows the need for more education though. Maybe we can focus on that after the threat of genocide has passed. \ud83d\ude43Well balls are the source of testosterone which obviously increases aggression and risk taking compared to those with lower/no levels.  It makes sense that having testicles became associated with aggression and risk taking.  Its origins arent in male=courage its that balls cause people to take greater risks, chemically.As a general rule, I don't worry about things I can't control or effect.\n\nI can't change the insanity that is the US. All I can do is care for and help the people I know.\n\nI only know one trans kid in my personal life. Luckily, their mother is wonderful. I gave that kid my old computer when I upgraded. I could have sold it for a couple hundred bucks. But I didn't need the money.\n\nNow, when I sign onto steam, I see that kid playing Stardew Valley. \n\nOppression is alarming, but it's our actions that measure us as people. Not our rush to judgment over hot-button social issues.They were inside the chambers disrupting proceedings and Zooey was enabling them.Well, that's corrupt.  But, par for the course.That's the thing that gets me. Democrats are just fine maintaining the status quo. When they have a majority across senate, house,  and white house,  nothing gets done. Nothing meaningful at least. \n\nRepublicans don't really need the federal power Democrats do. They can do what they want on state and local levels. And Democrats can just get \"outraged.\" \n\nThe Republican party is drifting farther to the right, and it is working wonders for them. The Democratic party is totally unwilling to move an inch left while our rights are being taken away and it's going to hurt them in the long run.We look back at a time when women and people of color did not have the right to vote or hold office and call it barbaric while this happens right now today and the historical irony is just completely lost. Then again, I suspect most of the culprits would openly admit behind closed doors that they\u2019re not on board with women and people of color having those rights.Read what they wrote again. It\u2019s the same thing as having a double heads coin. Heads, I win tails you lose. I win if there\u2019s heads, and I win if there\u2019s tails.Xantos, the freshmakerUgh, don't give them that much credit.\n\nDavid Xanatos saw positives in defeat on how to improve. The GOP still can't publicly admit Jan 6th was a coup attemptHey babe. Trans people were ABSOLUTELY a thing back in Biblical times. We\u2019ve ALWAYS been here. \n\nMesopotamian, Assyrian, and Sumerian cultures all had some form of gender variation/gender nonconformity in their \u201cgala\u201d priesthood, with the earliest documentation sitting around 4500BC.\n\nIndigenous cultures also had many examples of gender nonconformity, which we now collect in an umbrella referred to as \u201cTwo-spirit,\u201d which modern natives now consider under the trans umbrella.> There can't be anything in the bible about trans people, that wasn't a thing back then.\n\nHowever, Eve was made, literally, from Adam. I just find that ironic.First non-Jew converted to Christianity in the book of Acts is a eunuch, so there kinda is.lol I didn't even catch that! Fixed!Theres evidence of trans people throughout history and in most instances they are accepted.I love it! A logical argument! We got em!\n\nOh wait... It's Republicans... \n\nI don't doubt they'll bodyslam *her* and then expel her for \"assaulting the ground.\"> brown/black/Democratic\n\n= \u2018urban\u2019Not warm, safe, and flattered.\n\nRight wing media wants their audience scared, angry, and ready to blame the Other.And in the world of right-wing media, they told a very different narrative to their people about what \u201chappened.\u201d To Fox News viewers, an \u201cinsurrection\u201d happened in Tennessee and the GOP leaders heroically defended democracy.\n\nThe actual GOP in the state is face-to-face with the backlash and know very well that it was a giant mistake, but consumers of conservative media never heard that part. They heard about \u201cvictory\u201d over the uppity librulz trying to insurrect and take guns.Is \"woke\" becoming the new \"uppity\"?Very good point.I know it\u2019s a different state, but, do they not watch the news? I\u2019m in Canada and I saw that train wreck, no way they didn\u2019t know how it worked out in TN.Yuuuup. \n\nMinority groups can reclaim hateful labels to encourage solidarity. This heals the language. It takes the sting *out*.\n\nMajority oppressors corrupt neutral or even positive labels to misdirect, disempower, and confuse. This sickens the language. Jams the knife *in*.Like \u201cfake news\u201d. That pissed me off because it was so important for democracy to stress that sources promoting \u201cpizza gate\u201d and other hair brain conspiracies were crap and main stream, time-tested news agencies offer trustworthy analyses. Then the term got co-opted and applied towards actual journalism.Much like at CPAC, trying to dilute [domestic terrorist ](https://www.chron.com/politics/article/CPAC-Dallas-we-are-all-domestic-terrorists-banner-17359959.php)They're already hard at work. When protestors peacefully, and legally, assembled in the Capitol (After going through security and only accessing areas that the public is specifically allowed) they expelled 2 members and called it an insurrection. When people peacefully protested outside of the Capitol they called it an insurrection. The projection is always top of mind for them.Yep.Like they did with the word wokeFuck the GOP in generalYes, everything they do is great. Everything \"the other team\" does is bad. They have no values other than that.[deleted]Idk the whole welfare queens thing was complaining and I think complaining about poor and black people eating meat to be inherently snowflakey behavior.[deleted][deleted]what? gaslighting and projection are very different things. gaslighting makes the victim feel as though they\u2019re losing their touch with reality as the perpetrator lies to them about what they\u2019re seeing with their own eyes. projection is where a person accuses somebody of something that the accuser themselves do but the accused in reality does not do.Gaslight: \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing or experiencing (the very real thing) that you think you\u2019re seeing or experiencing\u201d\n\nProjection: \u201cYou\u2019re guilty of a thing (that is actually something that I\u2019m doing)\u201d\n\nThere can definitely be overlap in the Venn diagram, but not always.Not always. Gaslighting can also be doing/saying one thing and then claiming it never happened, or assigning different motives to someone else\u2019s actions.Sometimes projection is used as a specific example of gaslighting.  I.e. Republicans pretending that they are under attack (which is projection) to make it seem like their enemies (who are actually under attack) are crazy.\n\nBut you can have gaslighting that isn't projection (making them think they are crazy for reasons unrelated to projection) and projection that isn't gaslighting (e.g. calling everyone groomers to de-value the word and protect people like Gaetz.)Gaslighting is me telling you the sky is green so much that you start to believe me.\n\nProjection is when you say drag queens are pedophiles and then get caught online talking to children about their pp sizes.Prosper. They are the only ones who \"win\" with their objectives.Panic seems good \n\nWhile the \"Wrong Place\" shootings aren't anything new, it shows how many Americans feel on edge to the point of firing a gun at strangers if they're on they're property.\n\nJust fucking be normal and pretend you're not home.It's weird just how obsessed conservatives are with other people's genitals, isn't it?Trans people don't actually make conservatives uncomfortable, they merely pretend that so they can use them as scapegoats- meat for an ignorant base that was never taught history or biology, but will fall in line behind an emotional, untrue argument about 'grooming children,' which is nothing more than a distraction to pass meaningless laws on that subject, while avoiding legislation that actually matters to the country, like inequality, climate change, poverty, et al. Republicans are just scapegoating vulnerable people, making them into a curtain to hide what they're doing to everyone else too, while they endanger the lives and livlihoods of trans people, *they make us all* dumber, sicker, and poorer- for they are against all social policies that help people, and only for taking away the rights and well-beings of people who are not like them.Yup. Hell hath no fury like a white conservative who has been *mildly* inconvenienced.Meanwhile....\n\nConservatives: AmEriCa iS a ChRiStIaN NaTiOn!!\n\nUmmm what about not shoving lifestyle things down our throats?\n\n...oh yeah, nothing Republican politicians ever say is in good faith...This tells you all you need to know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4Zdx97A63s&t=121sIt'll change tactics and appearances again if it must but yep, it will be around as long as the party can go \"Lookee there! Weird shit!!\" While it picks the pockets of it's constituents. Also, as long as people express themselves, or complain about being unjustly derided, or commit the ultimate sin of \"existing while not being me\".Yeah, I\u2019ve just resorted to calling them bigots, racists, etc\u2026 to try to make them see that\u2019s how the world sees them.  Like my mom, she will tell you she\u2019s not racist, then spend an hour talking about how my cousin bought her black boyfriend a motorcycle and makes sure to call him black 18 times.They also made it so that giving the death penalty no longer has to be a unanimous decision. Now 3/4 of the jury can decide that the person should be murdered by the state.Oh nice, so if Democrats win the governorship anytime in the next 20 years, you can declare victory!Censure is official, on the records.Don't forget hate - it's the secret ingredient that makes it all work!It doesn't matter what it was \"supposed\" to be. Republicans overturned *Roe* and then in the very next election voters chose to give them the House. Yeah incumbent President and yeah inflation. Voters saw Republicans take a fundamental right from women and said \"these people need to have the power to shut down the government.\"You know women produce testosterone, too, right? In fact, they produce more testosterone than estrogen. It's just less on average than men.I believe we have a lot more say that we are led to believe. The USA is a representative democracy. We are also have a lot of people so admittedly, as individuals our voice counts for very little. But little is not the same as nothing.  And a lot of little is still a lot.  \n\nPolitical apathy is a dangerous byproduct of defeatism.How are you going to admit you know a trans kid and still say you're ambivalent to what trans people are facing right now. There absolutely are things you can do to help fight for us, you've just apparently decided it's not worth it.Rolling those rights back are going to be very high on the list if they manage to gain a little more power.Many are saying it without the closed doors right now.Good point.Zooey zephyr, the freshmaker.There really is nothing new under the Sun. We've been  made more aware of differing things in humanities walk thru life over the centuries is all. Thank you for sharing and enlightening myself and others. \ud83d\udc95TIL\n\nThere was definitely no hormonal or surgical treatment, though, right?[removed]It\u2019s so cringey, isn\u2019t it\u203d Fox News is still saying shit like \u201cblack on black crime\u201d with no indication that they know it\u2019s a wildly racist thing to say and that it misrepresents reality significantly. \n\nIt\u2019s so gross.\n\nEdited to change \u201cblack in black\u201d to \u201cblack on black.\u201d OopsYes, warm safe and flattered while they are watching. It\u2019s almost hypnotic how cozy my dad is when he\u2019s watching it. He is flattered into feeling like the people on his tv are his friends, they tell him the truth, it just so happens that it\u2019s what he already likes to believe, and that he is very smart for understanding how the GOP is always right and the left/dems are always wrong. These people are in his living room, proving to him that the world is scary if you leave your house, but he feels perfectly at ease keeping his ass in the recliner and voting straight R by mail every election. \n\nMy dad doesn\u2019t consume any internet propaganda. I think that a lot of the really crazy, anger-inducing stuff is coming from YouTube videos and Facebook. He certainly believes that all brown immigrants are dangerous and that the dems don\u2019t enforce border policy at all, but he himself is not fearful of them.It is still mind blowing to me, even after all these years, to see the discrepancy between what happens in reality and what is shown on Fox News. It\u2019s like a completely different world. \n\nI desperately, desperately want to avoid ever getting so comfortable with being told my views are correct & my opinion is correct that I allow a network to have a monopoly on my attention such that they are able to lie to me like that. It\u2019s fucking terrifying how easy it is to fall into that.>do they not watch the news?\n\nThey watch Fox or OAN, and there's no way that the coverage there was even close to reality.Also they're trying to dilute the impact of January 6th, by calling every other thing under the sun an \"insurrection\". \n\nIt's a stupid and obvious game.>Majority oppressors corrupt neutral or even positive labels\n\nAnd for some reason, the neutral/positive labels rarely get reclaimed. For example, the abandonment of \"freedom\", \"life\", and \"liberty\" to the right.Ah, I see. When then the right commits an insurrection, it's just a peaceful protest. When the left peacefully protests, it's an insurrection.Yes they do and it's terrifying.As Americans we value liberty and not fascism, so yeah this is absolutely fucking infuriating to everyone but fascist authoritarians.I fucking love rules and morality. I drink that shit up.  I grind rules and morality into a paste and slather it on my body. Why do you hate freedom and democracy?\n\nEdit: Damn he scurried off.If you're sure, you have sources you can share.What part is missing? When she said they had blood on their hands or when they tried to expell her from government for her statement?I see what you\u2019re trying to do, but I give you a C+ explaining the differences. \n\nWhile you are correct that these terms have different meanings, they frequently work in tandem.\n\nIf I accuse you of something that I\u2019m actually guilty of, that\u2019s projection. If you defend yourself and I refuse to back down from my accusation, thus denying your reality and often reality altogether, that\u2019s gaslighting.Hunter Biden laptop anybody?No\u2026. But, respectfully, if someone was murdered and the killer wasn\u2019t found the next day and I went around saying \u201cguess the police are letting this one off the hook!\u201d\u2026 most people would look at me like I was crazy.  If they were put on trial and before the trial started I said \u201cToo bad the judge already pronounced them innocent\u201d most people would think I was nuts and say to wait for the end of the trial.  And if I then said \u201cwell I guess we\u2019ll see Justice in 20 years and declare victory then!\u201d I would hope people would question what I was on about.\n\nIf they win the governorship\u2026 YES, I would say that was a victory.And? So are their own actions, which speak for themselves about the context.Ok.  And?  It literally does nothing that the GOP isn't already doing.The gerrymandering and restrictions on voting in the red states is designed to allow this. It\u2019s not that people don\u2019t get out to vote: it\u2019s that there\u2019s no point in voting when your particular district or what have you is designed so that there is no way in hell your vote is going to count.I mean a BUNCH of normal red voting Americans decided to go against their pattern and either vote blue or sit out.  We can be all doom and gloom in a desire to make it seem like republicans have more support than they do but I\u2019m not sure exactly why anyone would want to do that.  It\u2019s not \u201ctelling like it is\u201d.  It\u2019s \u201cleaving out particularly important bits of context and saying other bits just don\u2019t matter in the conversation so that a particular narrative can be made\u201d.  That doesn\u2019t seem a useful use of time to me.Yes.  Thats why I used the word \"lower.\"  I dont think there's any debate that as a general rule, people with testicles have higher testosterone and all accompanying behavioral effects, do you?\n\nIn fact, men typically have 10-20X the testosterone levels so i'm not sure why we even need to point out that women \"have it too\" as if it makes my theory/answer less legitimate.  \n\n\n\"it takes balls\" implies you need to be willing to take risks, and likely has a biological origin, not a male oppressive one.Do you expect every person to get out on the streets and protest? \n\nIf a person votes for people that represent values that would make sure trans people get what they need and then also treats trans people with general respect in their personal life, what more do you want?I'm in Canada. \n\nThe rejection of bodily autonomy rights the US is seeing hasn't infected our government. YET.I mean there's these anti trans bills with language requiring everyone wear \"gender appropriate clothing\" -- how long till that starts getting used to ban pants and athletic clothing for women?\n\n Better throw in head coverings and face veils \"for modesty,\" Miss Osborn, Y'allqueda is coming.I use this on my kids and it works every time.Y\u2019know, for all the frustration and mental instability that the internet has wrought on modern society, it\u2019s comments like this that remind me that it\u2019s still a game changer for human progress. \n\nThanks for being receptive to learning, stranger! Knowledge will always represent the path forward \ud83d\udc9cThe [Galli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli) were priests/priestesses who underwent ritual castration and dressed as women in order to worship their goddess. \n\nThis is [a fascinating thesis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/539632/d6348aa09f4510eb5704b6da501f9e7d.pdf) on their origins, which likely stretch back to ancient Mesopotamia.Not exactly. The earliest forms of what we\u2019d consider HRT can be found in early Greek society, where trans femmes would consume the urine of pregnant mares for its high estrogen content. \n\nFun fact: this source of estrogen would continue to benefit trans people through the modern era, with doctors in the late 1800s distilling the estrogen out of the urine to make a distillate that could then be pressed into tablets. One of the earlier forms of HRT for women was premarin (the symbolic \u201cred pill\u201d of the Matrix franchise). Premarin had its name derived from its origin - PREgnant MARe urINe.\n\nVery glad that we have synthetic estradiol now, so I don\u2019t have to chug horse piss every morning LMAOThere was absolutely hormonal treatment. The Scythian drank pregnant horse urine for estrogen, Primrose was used for breast growth, testicles were surgically removed and there are many more other examples that i cannot think of from the top of my head.Does becoming a eunuch count?Just out of curiosity, what should it be called?You can see it at /r/conservative. The specific policy type issues they talk about and are in favor of are invariably directly from the Democrat party platform and are consistently opposed by Republicans. Yet they still think Republicans are the heroes. It's complete bizarro world over there. I've seen the same thing from conservatives I know IRL. It's pointless to deal with people who don't live in reality. They could easily find out the real facts, but they don't do it.Obvious to you and me, maybe, but it\u2019s not obvious to my Fox-News-watching dad. He and people in his generation have the worst media-literacy skills. He doesn\u2019t question a god damn thing that the tv tells him when Fox, Newsmax, or other right wing horse shit is on. It\u2019s wild.Just like grooming. You telling children that people can be gay? We call that grooming. Us raping and marrying a 13 year old? You call that grooming. See, we both do it!When I see someone flying a flag, I have, I confess, a moment of queasiness. A transient knot in my stomach before I move on with my day.\n\nI *hate* that. I\u2019m more aware than most of how ugly our history has been, but the *potential* of this country, the ideals we constantly fall short of but some of us continue to fight for, are *fucking beautiful*. But we live in a world where the more prominently someone displays the flag, the more unamerican they probably are. It\u2019s heartbreaking.[deleted]Its the only argument they have. \n\n\"You're wrong by my standards so therefore fuck you youre wrong\"\n\nEven though the standards don't make sense and/or don't matter.Because they watch Fox?Narrator: \"but indeed he had not a single source\"i mean your example is fine, but gaslighting can absolutely be done without projection.\n\nThe origin of the term gaslighting from from a the play gas light. The husband lies his wife to persuade her that she is mentally unwell using the gas lights of the house.  \nHes not projecting anything on her, he just keeps lying to her to get her to start doubting herself and everything she thinks>If you defend yourself and I refuse to back down from my accusation, thus denying your reality and often reality altogether, that\u2019s gaslighting.\n\nNo it isn't. Gaslighting isn't just lying, nor is it \"lying in an argument.\"\n\nGaslighting is a form of abuse where you try to make a person question their perception and doubt themselves by denying their perception. And it most certainly is not identical to projection.Buttery males?Republicans won the popular House vote. Even being very generous to Democrats in accounting for uncontested races, Republicans won the popular vote.\n\nI know it's really comforting to believe it's all due to gerrymandering and suppression, but the fact is the vast majority either wanted this or didn't care enough to stop it. Voters chose to give Republicans the House. They could have stopped it, but decided not to.Is pretending that the House didn't go to Republicans after they took away a fundamental right better?I agree. Zooey has massive ballsThere's so much that you can do.\n\nNo, they don't necessarily have to protest, but showing up even for a few minutes with a sign to a protest in your spare time can make a difference.\n\nVoting is obviously very important.\n\nHelping educate others about us and correct misinformation helps.\n\nHell, even replying to posts like this verbalizing allyship and support and an intent to vote for people who don't want us dead can help some very scared people feel a little less hopeless, instead of commenting to say you're ambivalent about it all.Ah, gotcha. In that case, there still is some stuff you can do. You don't have to be entirely ambivalent.\n\nDon't assume it can't happen there, for one. Watch for it. Be ready to combat it. Our politics have a nasty habit of leaking over into Canada.\n\nIf possible, correct obvious misinformation and hate when you see or hear it (online or off). The less that shit is tolerated without blowback, the less people will feel comfortable verbalizing that hate and acting on it. When it's tolerated to a point where people become comfortable expressing it, that shit snowballs fast. As we're seeing in America.A willingness to stop, listen and remain always civil in ones reply goes an immeasurable distance in day to day life among one another. Love is the purest measure of willingness. \ud83d\udc9cOh, I was hoping somebody could bring a more informed source to the table for this one! Thanks so much, dear \ud83d\ude0a> Early HRT inspired the red pill\n\nGiven that the Wachowskis are both trans, I\u2019m very curious whether this has been confirmed by them or an inference drawn by othersWoah, that's stuff I never knew!\n\nThank you! I've learned so much this in thread.Ironic that the same sect of religion that used to cut off genitalia non-consensually is now upset that I consentingly want to get mine flipped inside outHow about just \"crime\" ? No need to racialize it. But they do anyway because it's red meat for their racist, xenophobic, braindead viewers.\n\nReminder that Fox is not interested in selling truth or facts. They are in the business of selling rage and bigotry.Do you ever see anyone talk about \"white on white\" crime? Or how about \"male on male\" crime?\n\nNope. They just call it crime.\n\nFox News is approaching this from a racist angle, because coming to the subject at any other angle would mean acknowledging literally any of the actual things that typically drive people towards crimes.Prevent access at the cable box and router at least. They're called parental controls for a reason.The good news is that we\u2019re reaching the end of this working as an electoral strategy.\n\n4.2 million young people become eligible to vote every year. That\u2019s 16.8 million new eligible voters in 2024 compared to 2020. They overwhelmingly lean left.\n\nThe only groups where Republicans hold any significant sway are Gen X, Baby Boomers, and Silent Generation members. There are very few of the latter remaining, and Boomers are also at an age where they\u2019re more likely to start running into issues like heart disease in large numbers.\n\nThe oldest Millennials are about 42 now. We\u2019re not kids anymore. Most of us loathe Republicans, and trending further left at an age when past generations had begun turning conservatives.\n\nThe Republicans Party has doomed itself. It may take a few more elections to play out, but they\u2019re like a deer that\u2019s been shot; they may still run a few miles, but they\u2019re done as a national party.I pledged allegiance to that flag, and the idealized nation it represented, and they have *stolen* that from us.Oh you doubt the source? Poor thing.It? \n\nDehumanizing someone is extremely fascistic behavior.>it\n\nDehumanizing opponents is text book fascism.I think it\u2019s gross that you use \u2018America\u2019 as your flair but you are so anti-democraticAlright, how about this one. Fucking selfish ignorant pig fuckers?\n\nOr this\n\nNazi wannabe morons who can't tell the difference between sex and gender. You have to be a special type of fucking stupid to not be able to get that concept, but no you'll scream \"biology\" even though y'all haven't take a biology class in years. \n\nYou're a special type of stupid that deserves to burn in hell, where all you fake Christian bastards will end up.Lol I love how the fascists are upset they\u2019re being called fascists so they dismiss it as a lefty buzzword. And you come here calling people snowflakes because your fragile masculinity can\u2019t handle that trans people exist and deserve right. Absolutely repugnant.I mean, what else would you call restricting the speech of an elected representative just because you don\u2019t like what she is saying?Re evaluate your definition of fascism because this is fascist behavior, what would you call it?\n\nAlso your transphobia is showinghttps://thehill.com/homenews/3972183-transgender-lawmaker-in-montana-faces-censure-or-expulsion/\n\nIs this a good enough source?>i mean your example is fine, but gaslighting can absolutely be done without projection.\n\nYeah\u2026 that\u2019s why I said they \u201cfrequently\u201d work in tandem. That word, frequently, also means \u2018not always\u2019\n\nAnd I\u2019m aware of the origins of gaslighting. The person I responded to made it seem like both terms were totally unrelated. I was showing that they are *frequently* very related.It\u2019s amazing how you put words in my mouth and create your own reality about what I said\u2026.. while discussing gaslighting.But the reason a lot of people don\u2019t vote is the gerrymandering and voter suppression laws, which are here to stay as long as long as the red states are red.\n\nIt\u2019s a vicious cycle. I live in Texas, so I know when I vote for a Senator it doesn\u2019t matter at all. Since I\u2019m in an urban area, my Congressman is a Democrat as are my reps in the TX House and Senate. But Texas makes sure to keep as many voting districts as red as possible. I vote, but it would seem pretty meaningless if I lived in a rural area. \n\nThe biggest reasons my acquaintances give for voting Republican are saving babies and saving their guns. They don\u2019t really care about LGBT rights and would prefer to live and let live. And they aren\u2019t exposed to the truth about how extreme the abortion bans really are, so they feel pretty good about the millions of babies they save (as long as they don\u2019t provide any taxpayer money to feed them or anything).No serious analysis takes \"popular house vote\" as anything meaningful. Its not a nation general referndum, its a peicemeal selection of districts.No one is pretending that.  They\u2019re pointing out that in a typical election the house is won by the opposing party by a significantly greater margin.  The fact that it wasn\u2019t meant that many elections were turned by this.  Obviously not enough but it not being enough is scant evidence for trying to sell a \u201cpeople WANTED this to happen\u201d.  At best what you can argue is \u201cnot enough people became involved that weren\u2019t involved before\u201d.  You\u2019d need to prove that a bunch of blue voters voted red to make your claim because there IS evidence that a lot of red voters either voted blue or didn\u2019t vote at all.The key I've found with people offline is asking how they know the things they say are true. Oftentimes, it isn't and they'll see it when they walk themselves there.\n\nIf you drill down to the basic principles, people individually tend to see reason. But if you dismiss legitimate held concerns, even if they're based on what you or I would label \"misinformation\", the blowback effect does the rest. So we should be very careful with that label.\n\nMy opinion remains the same as it's always been.\n\n\"People should live their lives as they see fit. We'll figure all this shit out over the course of time.\"\n\nBut maybe I'm just a crazy social anarchist. What is gender but another bullshit hierarchy?Admittedly, it\u2019s getting harder to remain civil in the face of ongoing genocide, but I try my best. I appreciate you for doing the same! Take care out there, dear!https://www.newsweek.com/matrix-creator-red-pill-trans-allegory-mens-rights-activists-1523669\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/matrix-trans-metaphor-lana-lilly-wachowski-red-pill-switch-sequels-a9654956.html\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-53692435\n\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/08/the-matrix-trans-allegory-lilly-wachowski[Lily Wachowski has confirmed that the Matrix is a transition allegory.](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/matrix-trans-metaphor-lana-lilly-wachowski-red-pill-switch-sequels-a9654956.html) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too far of a leap to think that the inclusion of the \u201cred pill\u201d was an intentional step, especially considering that premarin was encapsulated in a red capsule around the late 90s, when The Matrix was in production.I\u2019m happy to inform! It always does my heart good to remind folks that just because trans folks are more visible than we have ever been before, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re new. Just new to visibility \ud83d\udc9cLohlThey enjoy doing their own research. They've cracked the mysteries of a global conspiracy. I'm sure they can handle a 4 to 6-digit number that resets after unplugging the device for like 5 minutes.Which is precisely why Republicans have given up on elections. They\u2019ll simply gerrymander, and exploit loopholes in frameworks that relied upon gentleman\u2019s agreements and convention etc. to ensure they\u2019re always in power, right up until they can install their fascist regime and hold mock elections instead. Don\u2019t assume time will fix this. People need to be proactive.My dad is a Boomer, and he\u2019ll likely die in the next couple years, as will a lot of his generation. \n\nI\u2019m very hesitant to be as certain as you seem to be, as \u201cthe children will save us\u201d has been a refrain for ages now. The younger generations do lean left, but they are an inconsistent voter base. I desperately want them to actually register to vote and to vote in every election, but historically that hasn\u2019t been something we can rely on. \n\nI do believe that the GOP is losing its grip, but they still have far more control of our politics than they should. I\u2019d like to see them completely fall apart and be replaced by what we now consider to be moderate dems, with the other party being an actual left/progressive party. But I have no feeling of certainty that this will happen without a great deal of effort and some time. \n\nHelp your friends register to vote and encourage them to vote in every election. The GOP harms people you love. Stop them.[deleted]Disgusting behavior from the right. I\u2019m disgusted with myself that I use to be one of them. I was borderline in becoming that guy. But when you realize we\u2019re all human, with different experiences, it really changes your worldview. SHE is a mighty fine example of what I want in our representation in government. Someone willing to fight for the under privileged, for those who\u2019s voice is stripped from them. I find even when I don\u2019t agree with some of the more progressive reps, I love their passion and honesty. \n\nNow I\u2019m proudly independent voting for 97% democrats and third party or write ins. I will never support a republican again in the modern political climate.Their vision for America is a theocratic authoritarian state.[deleted]Yes I\u2019m aware what frequently means thanks for the lesson. \n\nJust saying I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s just about as often used together as not. Yes if you\u2019re projecting often you need to gaslight as well if pushed on the facts but gaslighting to gaslight someone generally doesn\u2019t involve projection as well. \n\nI still think the person you responded to originally had them explained just fineThat sort of avoids the point there, bossman. The part I quoted you typed, and is wrong. The person you're responding to was refuting someone who said that gaslighting and projection were the same thing, you gave them a \"C+.\"\n\nSo who do you disagree with here? Me, the person you responded to, or the person who said that gaslighting and projecting are the same thing?The GOP won the House mainly on the back of Democratic loses in New York\u2014a state that is considered to be gerrymandered\u2026 in favor of Democrats.\n\nu/TreeRol is right. Insisting that the problem is just gerrymandering / voter suppression just leads to myopic \u201csolutions\u201d that won\u2019t win over 2024 voters in Congressional races. They are absolutely issues, but they aren\u2019t the only issues.Well Republicans won that too. I'm trying to make things look actually better for Democrats by using popular vote, and even then it's bad.\n\nRepublicans won the House. They also won more votes for the House. All evidence shows that voters preferred Republicans.Why in the world would I need to prove that blue voters voted red?\n\nHave a look at the number of people who voted for Dems in 2020 vs 2022. These are people who weren't gerrymandered or suppressed away - or not a majority of them, anyway.\n\nThey stayed home, because they were fine with Republicans winning the House after taking away a woman's right to choose. They couldn't be bothered. They didn't care.That's a pretty fair way of looking at it.\n\nI like to think us non-binary trans people are shaking things up a bit regarding gender hierarchies. \ud83d\ude09Ayyy, nice! I knew some internet sleuth out there would be better at pulling sources than I am. Thank you, dear!Fascinating! ThanksNow I\u2019m going to re-watch Speed racer for any hidden Easter egg allegoriesThat\u2019s pretty cool, adds some depthAwesome. Thanks again.You've not met my parents, then.\n\nThey can't manage their own email client, or anything beyond the most basic Google search.It\u2019s not that the youth will save us. The problem for Republicans has more to do with elder Millennials who are trending further left at an age when past generations started becoming conservative. Unless this trend reverses (and I can\u2019t see any reason why it would) then the normal turnover of voters will make the Republican Party less viable with every election cycle.\n\nThe electoral math for Republicans requires that people over 35 start to become more conservative with age. That trend has not only stopped, but it\u2019s been reversed for a little while now. My fellow elder Millennials who complain about Biden are more likely to be Bernie supporters than DeSantis/Trump supporters.\n\nThey need my generation to betray the youth by turning conservative. That\u2019s how they counteract new voters. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always worked, but we broke the cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s like a hose where you pump water into the left, but the water keeps flowing to the right. There\u2019s always water coming in from the left and exiting from the right, but the overall amount of water in the hose remains the same. A few years ago we tied a knot in the middle of the hose. Water is still coming in from the left and exiting from the right, but now there\u2019s a buildup of water on the left because the middle water has stopped moving.You silly GOP snowflakes in your little delicate bubbles why a newsmax article and not a fox article? Or did y\u2019all break up? :(Go pray to your weak God that doesn't exist lmaoI thought the other person gave an admirable shorthand description of both terms. I just felt like they missed an important underlying point\u2026.that projection and gaslighting *can* be intertwined.\n\n>Just saying I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s just about as often used together as not. \n\nI would agree with you. I would just challenge you to hear me on my next point: In the world of statistics, if something happens 50% of the time, that\u2019s an incredibly high probability of it happening. Even if it\u2019s actually more like 30% of the time, that\u2019s still considered \u201cfrequent\u201d.  \n\nAnyways, I think we agree. I could have been less douchey in my argument. No debate there.Let\u2019s review.\n\n>No it isn't. Gaslighting isn't just lying, nor is it \"lying in an argument.\"\n\nAt no point did I even say the word \u201clying\u201d, let alone the entire quote you attributed to me.\n\n>The part I quoted you typed, and is wrong. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re clearly confused. \n\nWe can keep going, but only if you\u2019re able to acknowledge how wrong you\u2019ve been. Otherwise I\u2019m just supporting your *gaslighting* behaviors.Because that is the only scenario that matches your \u201cthey were ok with this happening\u201d.  Everything else is people NOT being ok with it happening or continuing to vote as they did before.  There\u2019s no way to prove that the people who didn\u2019t go out to vote in an off year aren\u2019t the same people who didn\u2019t vote in every other off year.  Some people aren\u2019t politically involved.  I wish they would be but that isn\u2019t proof that they were ok with the situation.Shake it up. \ud83d\udc4dOnce upon a time, i would spam these when right wingers would start going on about \"taking the red pill\".\n\n<insert Palapatine Ironic meme>Definitely! I\u2019ve gone back and rewatched the franchise since starting my transition, and WOW some of the symbolism is\u2026very obvious and heavy handed.\n\nLike, for example, Neo recognizing Trinity by her hacker name and saying \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a guy,\u201d to which Trin replies \u201cmost guys do.\u201dOops, sorry about that! Lemme close that sarcasm tag... </s>Yeah. I\u2019m 47 and I\u2019ve gotten further to the left as I\u2019ve aged. I see that a lot in my friend group, but of course anecdote can\u2019t be relied on as data or anything. \n\nBut I do think that the further right the GOP gets and the more they fuck with freedoms like abortion, with libraries, with women, and with the LGBTQ folks the more extreme and unappealing they will be to most reasonable people. They\u2019ve been courting crazy for a while, and I do think it starts to hurt them.I agree with your general statement and to me 30% chance does not seem high or frequent but I\u2019m not a math person so I\u2019ll take your word for it lol. That\u2019s probably where we were differing in our previous comments>If you defend yourself and I refuse to back down from my accusation, thus denying your reality and often reality altogether, that\u2019s gaslighting.\n\nIt's not. It's just lying. \"Refusing to back down from an accusation\" is not what gaslighting is.\n\nYour made up statistic about gaslighting and projection happening together 50% of the time is also completely unsupported.\n\nAnd all in response to a person who disagreed with someone saying that they're the same thing.While you did not type the *word* \"lying\", your hypothetical is an *example* of lying. They used it as a jumping off point.\n\nAlso when they said\n\n>the part I quoted...\n\nThey mean the part that looks like\n\n>this thing right here\n\nAnd not \"this guy over here\". I get the confusion, because \" \" are use to quote people, but in that case, it was to separate a phrase from the rest of the sentence in a legible way. When someone is referring to quoting someone else on Reddit, they mean\n\n>the words that are formatted like this\n\nAnd I think that's where the miscommunication is coming fromI'm discounting \"off year\" as an excuse. It's not an excuse. It's stupid, shitty, idiotic behavior that allows Republicans to do the things they do.\n\nThese people can vote, and we know it because\nthey voted in 2020. They decided not to in 2022. Because of that, Republicans won the House.",

He passed back in 2021. \n\nBack in 1995, he called me out of the blue while I was at work to tell me that they'd just been briefed by the climate research team about how they had proven that yes, global warming was a real thing and specifically linked to fossil fuels and that I should ignore all the anti-warming stuff coming out back then. \n\nHe still worked for them for the next 7 years until he retired. I don't see any way to say he was not culpable with it all. \n\nEverything he ever told me about the people there was weird. Like they had a guy on their  team who had a PhD in geophysics who was a young earth creationist. His rationale was that studying and understanding the earth as God made it brought him closer to understanding God's glory.\n\nI suspect the big fat paycheck also entered in to it. Those guy got paid very well to find more oil.Instead of paying lobbyists, they're paying for more lawyers.\n\nWin-win?Big oil didn't take enough justices on enough expensive tripsUh Oh Someone forgot to mail the free vacation invitationsNice try Clarence, we still know what you did last summer. And the 19 summers before that.How long had that decision been held in the supreme courts hands? And why make a decision now, so suddenly?SCOTUS - \"Please dont call us partisan, dont make Thomas resign, see look, we're going after big oil. Corrupt partisan hacks would never do that. Please forgive us for taking away the rights of millions of women, we wont do it again... any time soon... promise?\"We need a war on fossil fuel companies. I\u2019m not taking that back. Arrest them all. Exile them all.Oh no! Anyway...And so?  If Big Oil didn't do anything wrong they wouldn't be at risk for lawsuits.This is the way politician or supremacist court justices tell Big oil they need to be lobbied harder. Protection isn\u2019t cheap, bribes probably aren\u2019t keeping up with inflation.Hey everybody, look! It's a shiny distraction we just dusted of our shelf from the 1990s .Well shit I guess I\u2019m getting laid off.Well this fucking strange.He saw what's happening with Thomas and figured he should lay low for a while.Says he owns stock in one of the companiesExxon's internal documents about climate change from the early 80s have been leaked. Their findings pretty much match the IPCC. They proceeded to spend billions to suppress the idea.Capitalism will be the end of us if climate change doesn't do it first.I think that \"global warming\" was well understood to be taking place by the mid or later 70's.  It seems wild to me that actual scientists in a related field only got wise to this in the mid-90's.  \n\n\nI think that individual people have very little agency in service of their employers, especially if they are a large corporation or government and if they are not in a leadership position with significant influence, and job security and income protections.  \n\n\nI work to provide professional services to larger entities and have to put aside my personal aesthetic and political values, my own personal judgements and preferences when asked to.  Thankfully, there are back-stops in the form of laws and professional standards of practice, but if a developer I work for wants to kick a pile of old grannies out of their apartment building to build an indoor golf place or something,  I don't have much choice in the matter.  \n\n\nI imagine that a geologist working for an oil company is similarly bound to \"just doing their job,\" so I don't think that the moral weight is really on them personally.I know a rig boss that has a degree in chemical engineering that believes oil is being created as fast as we burn it by a \u201cconveyor belt\u201d at the bottom of the ocean. I asked him where the energy came from for the endothermic process of making oil from carbon, and he didn\u2019t know what endothermic meant.\n\nA degree means nothing.or justices are scrambling to redeem themselves.theyre trying to redeem themselves temporarily so people forget how corrupt they are. Fucking hacks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiKrWUoTq4sNever stopped these rat fucks in the past.\n\nHe's only doing it because he's seen how Thomas is going to get raked over the coals and probably sacrificed by the rest of the corrupt fuckers because he's got public attention on him now.Isn\u2019t Barrett\u2019s dad in one of these oil companies like Exxon or chevronFacebook did the same thing with the impact of Social Media on teens. It\u2019s actually pretty common for a company to research into something, figure out it\u2019s harmful before anyone else (though, sometimes it\u2019s like *who didn\u2019t know*?), and choose to hide that info for their own well-being as a company.Climate change is more or less the sword. I\u2019m confident capitalism will undoubtedly be the hand holding it if we can\u2019t get our collective shit together.Are there any countries under any economic system making any real progress?  I think you can probably lay the problem at the feet of human nature.It was being talked about on the news in the mid-80s.  It was called the \"Greenhouse effect\" then.  \n\nCarl Sagan knew about earlier and talked about it on Cosmos in 1981.\n\nWe have known. For DECADES.\n\nAnd done nothing.it is actually, if they dont speak out. People who do are called whistle blowers and those that dont are complicit.Why do people just _say_ things that are guesses as if they are true?Alito recused himself in *BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore* (2021) as well.Yes. Yes there are.There is quite a big gap between \"blowing the whistle\" on something that is generally not a secret and actually exposing corporate malfeasance.Because when we're denied the truth, we have no choice but to assume the worst.  There are no altruistic kings, I'm afraid, and American in general are not comfortable with the idea of a class of people ruling them and living beyond the reach of the law.Which ones?That\u2019s a googleable question and easy to find but Norway and England are among the fastest to adapt to the climate dangers. That\u2019s off the top of my head. \n\nWhat part of burning oil is human nature? That\u2019s a pretty new habit historically speaking.I think what was meant is that the habits are abstract. More like.. thematic tendencies. Not concrete do x with y.\nSo the abstract in this case has to be.. humans are inventive and prone to getting greedy, as well as capable of great evil to protect their circles and selves. \nHomeostasis (Google!) comes into play too, along with the tendency of not being good at foreseeing the course of complex systems over longer than a few years - we simple have not evolved for that and haven't been tested to think ahead a hundred or even tens of years.\nConcretely: big oil is a big club of people that get very wealthy from the enormous dependency on fossil fuels. They're resistant to change because 1) change is hard 2) same old makes rich 3) protecting the construct that provides their socioeconomic security and context.Both have capitalist economiesYou asked if any progress was made under any economic system. \n\nDid you mean any *other* economic system.\n\nNorway and Britain are also far more on the socialist side of things compared to US capitalism if you want to go that routeTechnically correct, I didn\u2019t specify\u2026 relied on the context.

The idea, developed by Carlos Moreno in 2010, is an urban design concept that aims to put everyday destinations for most people within 15 minutes of their homes, The New York Times reported.\n>\n>On the far right, those innocent-sounding urban planning standards have evolved into a conspiracy theory \u2014 that the urban planning ideas are a Trojan horse developed by a shadowy cabal of global elites, including the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, who want to imprison people in a small area around their homes.\n>\n>Plans to create a community on the approximately 600 acres at the Point of the Mountain have added to the hysteria and paranoia.

Really it's the only thing they do./r/leopardsatemyface \n\nSorry motherfucker, Republicans have been sabotaging education and truthful media for decades, so now this is your Republican voting demographic: uneducated, unvaccinated and ***way down*** the conspiracy rabbit holes.Oh, but he and his cohorts get to make up shit about trans people and other minority groups they don't like?\n\nLoser.Sounds like a case of, \"damn leopard ate my face\" \n\n\ud83e\udd74Good lord, we can\u2019t even have efficient city planning now? Conservatives, you need to cut it out. Go visit Amsterdam and check out their streets and neighborhoods, then tell me to my face you don\u2019t want to fix our urban planning here because you\u2019re afraid it is a conspiracy to imprison you. You don\u2019t even live in a city, genius! They\u2019d be imprisoning the awful libs or whatever! Just let us have mixed use zoning!!!Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the mental maturity of the Republican conservative party.So tired of these crackpots. Jesus. Elect a black president and half the country loses their minds.Their paranoia is so pathetic\u2026gawd forbid anyone build logical living places that don\u2019t require a car to do everything\u2026OMFG. Ok, yes, \"Smart Cities\" are a concept being touted. I work for a company selling technology marketed around that. It's a nebulous concept about city planners using network technology to automate everyday processes. You build a backend network, usually connected across the internet with security on it, to a control system, so that you can do stuff like automate when street lights turn on and off or dim, monitor air quality for possible smoke, detect if a pipe is about to burst, if a sewer is going to overflow, if the soil in a park actually needs to be watered, etc. It's nothing like these QNuts imagine.\n\nBesides, isn't their Q-God-Emperor pushing for new \"Freedom Cities\" with flying cars?I dunno. That\u2019s what the GOP is good at. Making up shit about people. It\u2019s a plank in their platform.This is like seeing a \"15 minutes or your pizza is free!\" ad and jumping to \"pizza is an Italian conspiracy to steal your F150!\"Yikes. This Preston guy lives near me and is an absolute nut. So glad his \"campaign\" didn't gain any real traction.It is a pretty crazy one.  I have seen hints of it on the Atlanta subreddit when conversations about making downtown more walkable/bikable come up.  The fuckers believe that somehow slowing down surface street speeds, adding crosswalks, protected bike lanes, and more public transit are a conspiracy against suburban commuters... instead of a livability improvement for people who (like me) actually live in the city.That actually sounds like something that Republicans would love to do... in areas with minorities.My boss has been talking about this recently. He buys into the conspiracy crap.The place I live has been doing this for years, weirdly people that live there are allowed to come and go, weird they\u2019re not imprisoned.Every single time I hear a conspiracy from the \"right\", I repeat: \"This is the stupidest thing I've ever head\"I hate these fucking wackjobs so much. They are the reason we can't have nice things. I'm really excited about this development. If it works, it'll be emulated all over the country. It's just not car-centric. That's it. Beyond that, it's rather benign, far from a utopia, and somehow, these stooges are trying to stop it.Most of the conspiracy theories are pretty nuts, but I'm really struggling to see what they fear in this one. \n\nLike, oh no, they're going to put the grocery store closer to my house.Smart cities conspiracy never made any sense to me. If I wanted to get rid of a large group of people, I wouldn't put them in a gilded cage, I would strand them in the wilderness with no supplies, soaked, in the dead of winter.Isn\u2019t that just a Daybreak style community?  To be fair I have very little understanding of this plan but it really does sound like the Daybreak model that appears to be thriving.It's amazing how they go from everything you might need is nearby to that meaning you cant travel. And that its all made up anyway (being built by GOP in utah) is icing on the cake. Oh no I don't have to drive across town to get or do something, the horror... People are weird, especially those buying all these conspiracies.LA for me in 2003~05 was a 45 minute city. no matter where you wanted to be it was always 45 minutes away. 5 miles or 35 miles... always 45 minutes. \n\nedit to note: I'm off topic \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afMy personal conspiracy theory is basically the opposite. I'm more worried it would go the other way and these amazing 15 min cities would be unavailable for anyone not in the top 20% of income. So used to exclude poor people. It's already basically like that for any walkable city in the US and my fear is it would only get worse, making the 15 min cities even more elitist and exclusive than existing cities already are. I love the idea but don't trust the outcome to be balanced in any fair way.These guys have never heard of the concept \u201ctravel\u201d. They apparently think that you\u2019re not allowed to leave the county you were born in.See that's the problem. They should have stuck to just making shit up about the democrats.when your policies are deregulation and tax cuts for the rich. you have to make up nonsense for idiots to vote for you out of fear of some nefarious scheme by evil democrats... who want to some how destroy everything even though they have to live in the same places.Exactly. It was just a matter of time before these nuts started turning on the Republicans too. Fuck em all.Right wingers have been spoon-fed conspiracy and paranoia for so long that any change to American life, anything at all, is immediately framed as the product of evil forces conspiring specifically against them.\n\nThe secondary emphasis of right wing media, after the fear and paranoia, is \"you are the main character\".  They also can't even conceive of anything happening in the world that isn't intended to affect them personally.\n\nSo the idea that a governmental policy could be a good thing in general, and that they are aren't the intended subject of it, is literally unthinkable for them.Yeah but in Atlanta these people are the NIMBY's who raise Hell when their county changes a stop sign to a traffic light, raises Hell whenever they want to add a lane to help carry the rush hour traffic home faster, and raise Hell because it takes them 3 hours to get home from work everyday because there's zero mass transit like trains that run close to them.Getting rid of Stroads would be awesome.  But this just seems like crazy \"ugga bugga\" scary conspiracy stuff.Not all of it's crazy, there might be a kernel of truth, here in San Francisco I have ridden bikes skateboards, roller skates, cars, trucks, motorcycles, and anything else that rolls for over 50 years, I still do except for the rollerskates. \n    We had a City transportation official accidentally say the quiet part out loud and admit they want to eliminate cars before having to backpedal and later be marginalized. Developers, lenders and unions (I'm pro union) are the driving force behind what they call traffic calming which consists of trying to make driving in the city as unpleasant as possible with the end result being everybody gets rid of their cars. Very, very, few of them Will be impacted as they either don't live in the city or are wealthy enough to not be bothered. This will free up space in development for more units as there are old requirements that are in place to provide parking so as not to impact the existing community. Little to no talk of turning are empty office buildings into living spaces (development is where the real money is).  Public transportation here is shit and it's not really an option unless you have no other options or if you ask a white 20 or 30 year old person with no dependents, that is if you can catch them before they move back  to where they are from to have a family or take care of someone. Now that San Francisco has so many residents with disposable income they'll take Uber or Lyft, the drivers will sleep in their cars until they made enough money to go back to their homes which are not in San Francisco. Those with real estate interests have been running the show in San Francisco all my life. Port officials ran a working port into the ground and are now self described as a real estate department. Our local rag (newspaper) loves to quote what they formally called a 'non-profit urban think tank' that has a donor list  that's a who's who of lenders, developers and anybody else with a finger in the real estate pie, they don't so much anymore, they're really lobbyists. My tinfoil hat theory is that the bicycle coalition is funded by them or was at one time. San Francisco has a tradition of funded phony grassroots campaigns (run, Ed, run is one).Ha! Was thinking \u201cthis sounds like the \u2018projects\u2019\u2026\u201d In the first 3 articles. And there is basis to back up this claim I have read in the past:\n\n[Redlining](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)Yes it is, but not nearly as focused on amenities or community space as far as I can tell. Its just not car centric. The concept is cool, but doesn't go as nearly as far as I would have loved to see. That said, its a great step forward and i really hope it succeeds.That's why they're so anti-EV.\n\nEVs challenge everything that they're used to and it (for some reason) terrifies them. \n\nEVs could potentially create a world where cars don't need gas, which means it'll create a world where gas stations are a thing of the past, which means that gas utilities will be shelved in favor of more environmentally friendly appliances powered by more environmentally friendly resources, etc, etc.\n\nTo most people, these are either non-issues or huge benefits. But for some reason, these people genuinely believe that this poses a threat to their day-to-day living and it's why they're so vehemently against them. And guess who they're told are against their ways of living? That's right! The Libs. And who funds these Libs according to Fox/Right-wing conspiracies? George Soros. \n\nTherefore, EVs are an attack on America, her values, and her freedoms all funded by George Soros and the globalist agenda.There is a special kind of NIMBY around here though that are *concerned* by things that aren't even their backyard. They are the ones who live in Dahlonega, commute to Buckhead (a 60 minute drive), and raise hell when a small side street in Midtown (30 minutes South of Buckhead) that they didn't even know existed is going to be restricted to car traffic to be more pedestrian and bike friendly.\n\nI mean the hate that the Juniper Street Project has attracted is kind of nuts.I mean, I agree with most of what you\u2019re saying but adding a lane of road for car traffic isn\u2019t going to solve traffic problems, just exasperate it.\n\nAnd road/freeway expansions often means displacing homeowners and businesses along the route, more car emissions along the route, more noise, etc. there\u2019s a freeway in Texas 26 lanes wide that still experiences traffic.\n\nJust focus on new dedicated rapid bus lanes and public transit.I see.  Thank you for the info.For me the time to recharge as opposed to 3 minutes to refill makes me skeptical of it as a total solution. I have to park blocks from my apartment so overnight doesn't solve the problem. But I have no reason to oppose evs for those who want them. I do wonder how viable it is for cross country trucking. But we will see how it plays out.>Just focus on new dedicated rapid bus lanes and public transit.\n\nHA!  Oh my lordy... If you mention rapid bus lanes or expanding public transit out in the suburbs they will respond like you just threatened to kill their family.\n\nThere was a voter referendum to add a spur to our public transit trains out to Gwinnett County, in order to help alleviate the choking rush hour traffic that was only going to get worse as the population there grew.\n\nTalking to people there who were against it was bizarre and often filled with dog whistles eluding to racism.The problem here in Atlanta is the people who are complaining don't even live in the city. They commute in and work there.I'm in the industry all tied to this stuff with EV charging and utilities. You are right, there is a LOT of infrastructure that needs to build out to make it both easily available and affordable for the everyday American (myself included) to want an EV and be able to use it like we do our current cars. To be honest, that is the point of a huge portion of the Infrastructure and the Inflation Reduction packages that Biden got passed. There is a shit load of grant money flowing to build out the stuff needed to make that happen. That will inevitably bring the costs down on it for the consumer too.\n\nOn the comment you were responding to also, utility companies are already slowing down on natural gas in general. A number of them are not putting new gas lines out to new construction homes or neighborhoods where it isn't already deployed. The costs and risks of building new gas connections is just too much. Utilities are investing in moving away from fossil fuels to renewables at a massive rate. Look at the Big 3 US car manufacturers doing the same. Most of that is simply them reading the wind. The changes are coming. Like any massive shift, it will be a little bumpy. There are just those right wing and crazy elements of our society who fear anything that differs from what they were used to 30 years ago.That's the thing. The idea of an EV is that you charge either at home or at work, so you pretty much start or end your day having a \"full tank\" every day. You shouldn't really think of an EV in the same light as an ICE where you pretty much drive everywhere and then refuel at a different spot when you need to. Basically, your home is your \"gas station\".\n\nIt really does sound great, but as you pointed out, if you live in an area where there's no real dedicated charging at your home or work (especially if you live at an apartment/complex) it can absolutely suck to have an EV. Frankly I'm not too worried about this since more chargers are being added on a near daily basis, so within the next 5 years I have a feeling it'll be a non-issue in cities/suburbs (especially since newer construction projects for apartments/condos are already building charging stations). \n\nI know plenty of people who go on road-trips with their EVs and they seem to have very little issues, so I can imagine that trucking won't be that much of an issue, especially within the next few years.doable with infrastructure investment.  UK has been trialing a cable car like system.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3P_S7pL7Yg>HA! Oh my lordy... If you mention rapid bus lanes or expanding public transit out in the suburbs they will respond like you just threatened to kill their family.\n\nI am sure for some of the deluded fools they actually believe public transit is a threat to the lives of their family; i.e. if they can use it to go into the city, \"colored people\", etc... can use it to come to their suburbs.\ud83d\ude44",

But I have no sympathy for conservative stupidity.The Republicans promised defense cuts. There won\u2019t be any. But those lazy veterans are getting a kick in the pants!As the daughter, sister, and  wife of career veterans, I cannot for the life of me see why anyone in the military would vote Republican.At this point grown adults should be embarrassed at using \u201cwoke\u201d as it has become a meaningless term. \n\nWe see it being used time and time again to hide lies, corruption, and seething unfounded hatred of others.Republicans hate spending money on veterans.As an individual so uses the VA and receives a disability rating, this guarantees I will not be voting Republican at the state or federal level unless some drastic changes are taken. At the local and county level I tend to vote for whoever lobbies the issues I find important, but I can\u2019t vote against my own well being by supporting these policies that deem that what I sacrificed physically and mentally over in Iraq and Afghanistan is no longer guaranteed or important.Shocking. It's almost like every person with the ability to speak said this would happen, and then it did. I'm convinced the only people remaining on that side are either in on the grift or are so far in hole their wee little brains can't comprehend they've been duped. You can't be remotely educated and still buy what they're selling.There\u2019s nothing more Republican than wrapping themselves in the flag and fucking over veterans.Republicans hate veterans. They always have and always will.It's really funny that Rs are doubling down on this woke bullshit given how much an opposition party could run on in this current climate. Totally rudderless.GOP sure do like to lie - Bigly...we support veterans, watch us wave a flag....assistance for services - NOPE  (that is \"woke\")Not paying soldiers literally led to the fall of Rome, but let's see what happens this time!I feel bad for the like 2% of the military with enough intelligence to stay informed and know that Republicans have always been anti-military and anti-veteran.  Unfortunately most of their co-workers and fellow veterans are still going to vote \"R\" every election.  Republicans learned decades ago that they don't have to do anything to earn those votes and there's nothing Democrats can do to win them.  In fact, they can send them to die in pointless wars meant to line their own pockets and screw them over as veterans and still rely on their votes.  The ones that live at least.It's always someone who has never served his country that wants to do this.Government should send out letters saying \"Your benefits have been cut because you voted for \"name\" law which was enacted by \"names\" politicians.Speaking as a woke veteran, I can only say fuck that asshole McCarthy.At this point, it's probably safe to assume anything \"woke\" is probably good for the common man.Anything that does not enrich the powerful is very conveniently piled under the \u201cwoke\u201d label.The GOP is anti-veteran. Has been for decades. Sign up. Serve. Die.My maga dad is an 80 yo Vietnam vet. How shit like this doesn\u2019t register with him is beyond my comprehensionThey use that term because it works on the weak minded.\n\nHe's not an idiot. He knows Republican voters are idiots. He knows they will just react to \"woke\" and not the actual issue. That word shuts down Republican voters' brains.\n\nOne fact the internet age has taught us is that Republican voters are largely uninformed people who don't know and don't care how anything works, but believe that  they are the only ones who know how anything works.\n\nBut they just want to see their \"team\" get a leg up on another \"team.\" If you can hurt someone Republicans don't like, they will follow you to the ends of the Earth.\n\nRepublican voters are pathetically obsessed with \"winning.\" You can even tell them they are winning when they are losing and they will celebrate. This is why they blindly follow people they perceive as \"winners,\" even when the evidence contradicts that.\n\nThe Republican voters who are not idiots are sociopaths who care only about themselves and people they can use. The idea of gaining $50 by denying a child food is appealing to them. \n\nRepublicans' rampant Christianity is the beard that helps them hide their rotten nature. And yet just as with everything else, non-Christians know far more about the Bible than the faithful, because most Christians' faith is so shallow.\n\nLook forward to McCarthy saying that not supporting tax cuts for the wealthy is \"woke.\"Money for the troops is woke, don'tcha know?Nobody hates veterans more than the GOPI used to be a lobbyist for one of the largest VSOs in the nation.\n\nIf this is surprising to anyone, it's because they haven't been paying attention.Democrats Support the Troops. Republicans Support the War Machine.\n\nWhich party is Pro Life again?Republican law makers don\u2019t have as many shares of \u201cVeterans stock\u201d as they do General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin.Republicans will gladly send our troops into war if it benefits their single agenda. But, those same troops better know their place. They should not expect any health, education disability, financial benefits for their service. HOWEVER, you can pose for pictures with GOP members to help them win re-elections and larp as uber patriots.If you hear someone say that the military isn't the place for social experiments, you need to remind them that the military was one of the first places to be desegregated.Republicans love the military (industrial complex) and love to call every member a hero... until they can't send them to fight and die for their lobbyist money.God damn it. God damn these fucking monsters.Republicans only support their puppet masters.What? Republicans want to fuck us some more? No way! It's almost as if they spend other time complaining about the other side and how much they hate America but won't actually do anything for Americans.\n\nImagine that.\ud83d\ude44Oh, it's because he doesn't want to do anything Jon Stewart thinks is a no brainer.Disabled Vets like me depend on the VA for many services - I am thankful for the more innovative approaches: water therapy, music therapy, cognitive behavior therapy\u2026Republicans: *Why you care so much about the elderly and the people who served? You snow flake!*Certain members of the Freedom Caucus receive funding via in a round about way from lobbyists for the Kremlin (it\u2019s no coincidence Marjorie Traitor Greene frequently uses Russian talking points). Any cuts to operational abilities (and program spending on veterans) needs to be gone over with a fine tooth comb given certain Freedom Caucus members\u2019 antipathy to the war in Ukraine and their admiration for dictators.\u201cSupporting the people in need who we promised support to and emotionally crippled is woke\u201dWoke is a meaningless word. It\u2019s a cue word for their supporters. It means anything they don\u2019t like and it doesn\u2019t matter how or why because the word is enough to mean it\u2019s bad.No one hates taking care of the people who volunteer their lives to defend this country like Republicans. \n\nThey'll wave a flag in their general direction, though. Surely, that's just as good as actually helping.Republican agenda: kill all people who are unable to provide labor, enslave the rest. Any questions?What is it with the GOP and their absolute hatred of \u201ccaring\u201d?Most politicians, especially Conservatives, only care about the military(future, active, or former) when they make a good prop.Whatever \u201cwoke\u201d is supposed to fuckin mean, I\u2019m 1000% sure it cannot, under any circumstances, accurately describe any form of military spending.Gotta pay for those tax breaks to the wealthy somehow...may as well be with the blood and minds of the men and women who fought for our country. -- RepublicansMy senior Korean War vet uncle is the \"woke\"est person and he does such a good job educating his friends (and Racist Aunt Jackie) on social media.The VA\u2019s fav words \u201cWe have determined your claim, is NOT service related.\u201dGreat, there goes the Veterans health benefits I rely upon because my employer works me 39 hours one week then 45 hours the next....week after week.....\n\nMight as well be living in Uganda...Yes Vet support has been a Woke issue for a while now and as a vet thinking we owe you anything makes you woke now too.\n\nInteresting times to be a Republican who hates their own Country.We still at about 1 vet suicide an hour and no one gives a fuck? Yeah I figured...Whenever the bills 1000 pages long, and you only have a day and a half to read it along with your lawyer and your constituents\u2026 You can\u2019t make everybody happy within that bill or legislationDid you even read? They are 2 completely different budgetsNot to mention all the medical transitioning for anyone.  Who do you think is joining the military?After pushing 20 years of war in multiple countries on the American people there turns out to be a large swath of the population that are veterans that will need life long care and assistance,,,, *pikachu not shocked face*Let\u2019s fuck over the people that gave up the mostWhat the GOP has done to vets over that last few years should be showcased more, may break the trance they have over some more rational mind moderates.As a Veteran, and on behalf of other Vets, I gotta say, what an asshole!Taking care of veterans is pretty woke thinking for the gop.Can someone please explain to me the \u201cWoke\u201d narrative that is being pushed by outlets like Fox News, etc? My neighbors are in their 80s and we\u2019re trying to tell me that they disagree with \u201cthe Woke\u201d and I could help but laugh. They couldn\u2019t even explain what they were talking about so I know they were just parroting what they heard on TV. The War on Woke seems so dumb but I really don\u2019t know what it is trying to accomplish other than the typical -back in my day things were better schtick.Because it works. Thier voters only hear the parts they want to hear and don't track what they're actually voting on. Just like all the times they take credit for funding they voted against.It's called lyingThey love soldiers, hate veterans. I think they wish they'd all die in wars so they don't have to support them afterwards.[removed]Apparently they missed the video of these dipshits tanking the PACT Act then fist bumping each other.They support the making of American veterans \n\nNot the actual veterans themselvesThose vets just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, especially those lazy layabouts who left their arms or legs in Iraq and Afghanistan! Amurica!It's a consequence of having a dedicated propaganda network that allows them to push whatever the hell message they want.\n\nThey love pro-military propaganda because that's an issue from which it's relatively trivial to germinate emotional responses. The public can easily be swayed from inconvenient facts when the alternative is being labeled anti-military. See also: Freedom Fries.\n\nBut caring for veterans is expensive and veterans aren't actually actively contributing to our military conquests, so, meh. It's utterly hypocritical, of course, to pretend to support our troops but to gut support for veterans, but propaganda networks function precisely to enable that hypocrisy.They hate everyone and everything, what else needs to be said? All that they ever care about are themselves.The only time I threw anything at my TV was watching CSPAN. The GOP representatives wanted to cut military family financial support if they didn\u2019t get their rich donors tax cuts.As I\u2019ve grown older, I really do support and value people who have served in the military, even if I disagree with the conflicts they\u2019re involved in.\n\nThat being said \u201csupport our troops\u201d really translates to \u201csupport our military contractors\u201d. If any politician were to propose a cut to our bloated budget, they\u2019d be massacred.they're talking about the classiv movie veteran who cam from WWII, or at most, vietnam.\n\nNot the ones dying of cancerous burn pits in the iraq warrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, or afghanistan, or any of the \"woke\" wars.\n\nThey mean themselves is what I'm sayinbg.They want to virtue signal not virtue act.Oh, like they support police at the insurrection? Yeah. Seems about right.Didn't the last GOP president assert that POWs are cowards not worth having in the military?\n\nConservatives vote how they do for a lot of reasons, let's not kid ourselves it's because of how much the party respects service.As a veteran I can tell you that they're absolutely full of shit. Repugs have never done anything to help our veterans that they didn't feel like they absolutely had to after being badgered and called out.\n\nThey send our young people off to be abused, injured, or die and then throw them to the wolves when they're done with them.Everyone I personally know that served in the military either votes for Republicans, Libertarians, or doesn\u2019t vote. This won\u2019t change their vote. I live in Alabama.The first thought I had was how many abortions does the military really have?\n\nAnyone who has served knows that step 3 of the dependopotomus lifecycle is getting pregnant.Unless you are a vet don\u2019t tell me about how Democrats are the champions of benefits for veteransI've known vets who have voted against their own interest and health for years and then get angry about something, because it's something that suddenly hits their life hard, and have a sort of lucid realization....on that one issue. Then, after they've complained and made promises to not be swindled again, they go right back to being the stooge who votes for their own demise.Thoughts and prayers are good enough for everything except abortions and books.  Those require immediate action!> thoughts and prayers is all they are willing to provide.\n\nIt's ok. Those thoughts and prayers and bootstraps will be good enough when the vets get tossed out of the VA system after the Republicans privatize  it and gives those billions to for-profit hospital corporations and Wall Street, and they're on their own.Same thing with unborn fetuses.\n\nYou can make a semi-convincing show of pouring your heart and soul into shallow gestures like the \"pro lifers\" do. But what's difficult to convey is the integrity to stand with women throughout the myriad issues related to fertility.Afraid cognitive dissonance will win as even conservative veterans promote that in order to \"own the libs.\"Why are they defunding police? I thought they were buddies?(Above is sarcasm, by the way)\n\nThe Veterans Administration fits precisely the conservative definition of a woke institution where members of certain favored groups are encouraged to boo-hoo for special favors.Disclaimer: Not a Vet myself, but I work with a lot of them in my branch of the federal civil service.\n\nIt is so beyond fucked up that cutting veterans benefits is even something that can be discussed with out commiting political suicide. I work with people every day who have various levels of physical disabilities due to their time in service, let alone the mental traumas some of them have to live with.\n\nWe as Americans signed a social contract with these men and women that we would provide for them, after they put themselves, body, mind, and soul, on the line for our way of life.\n\nNow, you may disagree with the policy, past and present l, of the Government of the United States, and it's military, but the people who go into those jobs, either from a sense of duty, patriotism, or simply for the economic and educational possibilities that it affords them are owed a national gratitude.\n\nThe current state of the VA (and healthcare in the US in geny) is already disgraceful. Cutting anything from it or making it worse is a slap in the face to all uniformed service members, past and present, and to the civilians in the VA and other branches of the civil service, who have dedicated their lives to the service of their country.\n\nShame on anyone who trys to minimize that or take that away, shame.And they will turn around and make campaign ads about how we need to  support our troops, etc.Me either! Matt Gaetz openly called to get rid of the VA program, and Ted Cruz voted to get rid of the burn pit registry. \n\nRepublicans don't gaf about veterans anymore than they do LGBTQ, minorities, or women!Pretty much any career involving the usage of force will attract overwhelmingly conservatively minded people. Just how it is, though why precisely that is is beyond me. If I had to guess, probably something to do with the inherent hierarchical nature, something at the core of conservative ideology.\n\nNonetheless, even though Republicans consistently vote against the actual interests of veterans, they consistently win them over via the push for overall cultural conservatism. That's true for many Republican-voting demographics, like farmers for example, who are routinely screwed over by Republican policy yet almost exclusively vote Republican due to their hardcore Christian rural values.They use the word more than anyone else. \n\nAnd they can't even explain what it means.It's unfortunately not meaningless to them. It's a fear mongering war cry that directs their violence as their leaders see fit.\n\n\nThey have turned woke into a hate slur.But they love sending us to war.  \n\n-retired military and disabled veteran.Republicans hate doing the right thingRepublicans hate veterans.If you read into the Bonus Army, it really sells this idea. The Republicans basically ignored the plight of the World War I veterans who were sleeping in tents, and it may have cost them 70 years of government control for their heartlessness.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus\\_Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army)Thank you for your service.Absolutely, we all saw this coming... so why didn't Democrats do away with the debt ceiling when they had control? \n\nBills were introduced in both chambers in 2021, but went nowhere. Biden even said he was against abolishing the debt ceiling. So, here we are... about to begin negotiations to cut Democratic programs, just like in 2011.\n\nThe lack of Democratic action is telling: party leadership actually wants spending cuts, to mollify its wealthy donors. There's no other explanation for why they didn't act on this when they had the chanceThey'll talk about how much they love them at sporting events though.Oh, that's not true.\n\nThey like veterans who vote Republican and don't actually cost any money or need help, or use benefits that Republicans could be using to enrich themselves.\n\nThe dumb veterans, in other words.Unfortunately many veterans will still never vote for anyone else, though. Just like with other demographics, like farmers, their overall cultural conservatism tends to override the actual detrimental policy of the Republican party.It's definitely more than 2%, thankfully. Interestingly enough, as an organization, our military is very progressive from a policy standpoint. Pride Month is officially recognized and military education/marketing provides educational materials to be posted at units. One of these Pride Month displays was ripped down by someone at one of my former units. Never found out who did it but leadership made it clear that if you touched those boards without permission, you'd be answering for it.  \n\nI was also on deployment last year right after Roe was struck down. Every single male in my shop clearly stated that they did not agree with abortion bans. \n\nIt might be different for different branches, but in my experience the Navy, the MAGA-type republicans are few and far in between. The majority, I'd say, is far more libertarian, which is still not great, but it's not MAGA. \n\nEspecially in the last few years, the military has been implementing tons of policies that alienate MAGA types. It's funny that they join and find out the military actually stands for everything they're against.>anti-military and anti-veteran.\n\nThe my are pro military, but anti enlisted servicemen.It always has been that. Any time you see someone say woke you can be certain it is to help a certain group of people while also not hurting any other group. Even florida defined woke as being progressive activism and \"it would be the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them.\u201dThe right has been gutting vet care for decades. You just gotta look up the votesYep.Transgender people have been statistically more likely to serve than the general population for years.  So while you're still a scumbag, you're actually not wrong.Exactly. I work with disabled Vets (I are one too) and the sheer amount of \"Goddamn liberals!!\" type complaining I hear is not surprisingly very common. They will never acknowledge that they are on a form of assistance that needs support, hence vote for those that continue to support you. And I saw it yesterday, those same folks raging against the machine are very much those that vote. I think I was the youngest in the crowd and I am no longer a young man. Republicans have long weaponized outrage and selective speech to make them seem like the better choice.This, and apply it to the economy. The Republican Party has been absolutely spectacular at marketing itself as the best party for the economy, despite the economy almost always doing better when the Democrats are in charge. If the Dems would put more into messaging and less into whatever the hell they're blowing money on these days, they could win this argument and doom the Republican Party to being a minority party forever. The Republicans write bumper stickers, the Democrats write essays, and 90% have neither the time, interest nor aptitude for reading essays.Don't forget the naming of bills as the exact opposite of what they do. Like the \"clear skies act\" that allowed more pollution.I feel like the Democrats need to push this more in their messaging.  Confront R's on their track record on their votes for topics like these, that are directly in conflict with their perceived positionsRepublican voters believe what they are told over what they can observe. Republicans say \"we support the troops\" and the base believe it no matter what legislation they pass that actually hurts the troops.They've convinced voters during the early 2000s that supporting war was the same as supporting soldiers or vetsAnd those voters include many actual veteransRepublicans are far too stupid to understand that\n\nHell they don't even understand how advertising works and get really mad when companies advertise to other people.They don\u2019t even love soldiers. That\u2019s been bullshit for *years*. They love *war*. When we\u2019re at war they love soldiers, when we\u2019re at peace suddenly they couldn\u2019t give two shits. Military members are only valuable to conservatives as long as they\u2019re a tool to be used in the war machine. Once they wear out (age), malfunction (speak out against their policies, exist while anything other than straight and white, act \u201cwoke\u201d), or break (mental illness), they\u2019re nothing to conservatives.it sounds like Christians worship a lot of death. almost cult like... perhaps a death-cult even.What we need is somebody like Jon Stewart to head up that kind of a charge. Especially after the work he put in for the First Responders of 9/11.I remember that, disgusting.I don't man, I saw this documentary about a Vietnam vet in Washington State. They did not like him very much.That's because the vast majority of us veterans don't talk about being veterans. Only the loud dipshits do. My group of friends is majority veteran and that's not what makes us friends. And none of us vote Republican. That's like saying I see lots of Trump caravans and no Biden caravans. Normal people don't do that. Weird shit.That is so sad, I'm so sorry.I'm a vet and fuck anyone who thinks the republicans do anything for the vets and democrats don't. It's been almost 40 years since I was in and even then it was right in the newspapers in black white how the reps were screwing us and saying the exact opposite. It hasn't changed one bit. Plus there is no reason someone need to be a vet to see or comment on it.I\u2019m a vet. Yea, Democrats in general actually try to govern. Which is better for everyone, including vets. Republicans will and have gut spending everywhere they think they can (that doesn\u2019t directly harm their corporate backers).\n\nAlso, anyone who can present a good argument should be able to present it, regardless of affiliation with the topic. To claim only a vet can comment on veterans affairs is playing right into that woke identity politics bullshit.What exactly have Republicans done for you? This isn't a \"both sides\", any time the Democrats try to help ANYBODY, the Republicans block it. One side refusing to do anything and actively stopping the other side from doing anything is not both sides failing you.Not a vet, but my family members are. They have nothing good to say about republicans, the only politicians they have anything good to say about are democrats. When one party pays lip service but attacks everything you have and everything you fought for, while the worst the other party does is just not improve things, guess which you will like more?I have done enough research about it and have talked to plenty of Vets. So I feel pretty good about what I'm saying. So I will say what I want, when I want, and there isn't anything you can do about that. Because, that's what \"real Vets\" fought for. \n\nHave a nice day.I'm a vet. The Republicans fuck us every time and then super jabber about cost of living allowances that happen as the pay raise while the democrats just do the cola silently.https://preview.redd.it/2vi564397ova1.png?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=648c7d7620aa9a6aba8ac943d77728d2652342ea>Unless you are a vet don\u2019t tell me about... \n\nwhat is with the need to start with a shutdown comment?Vets are require more effort to ignore.\n\n\"The unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe.\n\nPrisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans?

They're for it now that state investigations into Republican activity in 2020 is happening and the FBI did a damning search and seizure at Mar-a-Lago and now that Trump has been indicted. \n\nDid you know that last year, the SCOTUS ruled that federal agents protected from civil lawsuits for violating someone's Constitutional rights? That was before the Mar-a-Lago FBI search.>The current state of the VA (and healthcare in the US in geny) is already disgraceful. Cutting anything from it or making it worse is a slap in the face to all uniformed service members, past and present, and to the civilians in the VA and other branches of the civil service, who have dedicated their lives to the service of their country.\n\nAfter over a decade since I left service, the VA is finally useful to me and not a source of more frustration. Now the GOP wants to destroy that.Political suicide is usually an after-the-fact thing. If they cut VA funding, they won't feel that pain until their constituents do. When disabled vets can't get timely health care appointments anymore, that's when you'll see backlash.\n\nI suspect it'll be like abortion. They all thought that they wanted it to go away until it did. Some of them changed their minds right quick. Enough to swing a lot of elections.Also, I think it's a common misconception that vets receive no cost medical care for life, rather it is only on a case by case approval.> Ted Cruz voted to get rid of the burn pit registry.\n\nThen [Ted did a celebratory fist bump](https://www.newsweek.com/gop-fistbump-pact-senate-military-ted-cruz-steve-daines-1729031) after voting down the burn pit bill.>And they can't even explain what it means.\n\nYou couldn't be more on target:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRm8-379XHMYou\u2019re probably the last person who needs to hear this, but unfortunately war is good for business (the military industrial complex specifically). I may hate the US military leadership\u2019s constant desire for a new war, but I also know that active duty, reserves, and retired service members don\u2019t get much of a choice.\n\nThank you for your serviceThis is the best way to sum this up\u2026But they love soldiers.  See also fetus vs child, virgin girl vs mother, \u2026. I could go on\u2026.. Republicans LOVE SYMBOLS.  symbols of virility and innocence.Republicans hate people but they love war and fetuses.And 9/11 responders.Yes... the lack of democratic leadership made McCarthy come up with this. Yes, I'm sure you're right.That doesn\u2019t cost them anything and doesn\u2019t require decisions to be made. They\u2019re only useful as props to the GOP.For sure I was being hyperbolic with 2% but Republicans do have a stranglehold on this demographic.  \n\nIt's good to hear your branch isn't full on MAGA but unfortunate that their votes still lead that way.  Not sure what Democrats need to do to break through or if that's even possible.  Policy isn't doing it that for sure because they'd all be voting Democrat if it was based on policy that actually benefits themselves.I don't think sacrificing our military members to line their own pockets really qualifies as \"Pro-Military\".  At least in the way they use the term \"Pro-Military\" in their propaganda.It\u2019s called bait and switch. Bait with conservative views and fear monger if then switch with removal of benefits. Pretty diabolical and evil really.\"The Democrat government better keep its dirty socialist hands off of my Medicare.\"The Republican decision to defund police departments and veterans is an enormous strategic blunder. But I have no sympathy for conservative stupidity.It's both very surprising and not surprising at all when I hear it.\n\nSadly, people can be pretty ignorant and lazy, and only care what people *say* rather than what they do.  It's much easier than digging into the actions behind the words.\n\nI'm a vet, and a nigh-perfect fit for a conservative demographic(white, male, bible belt, rural upbringing) and might even have kept being one had I *not* enlisted.  It took *very* little time in the service to liberalize after seeing the often *vehement* efforts to *specifically* fuck over servicemembers and veterans. So I'm always surprised when I hear the \"gawdurn libruls\" BS because *dude did you not pay any attention at all to who was trying to help you and who was trying to fuck you over\" but not surprised at all because of course they didn't.  Just soundbytes in the media.Turns out it's really easy to make pithy statements, and really hard to make pithy statements that truthfully engage with nuanced issues.'Member when Republicans kept referring to \"the Obama economy\" and conveniently leaving out the little economic oopsidaisy that happened in 2008 when Bush was still in office?As a middle class family man with a mortgage, kids, student loans, in a high property tax area, I have never paid more money than after Trump got his tax cut.  It gutted all of the deductions that benefits the middle class. It fucking sucks.  I mean I don't mind paying taxes if I feel like everyone else is in the same boat, but when the largest tax cut in history happens and my taxes double I get pretty salty.This all day\"Right to work\" lawshe should run for president - I don't care that he's an actor - he obviously knows how to research issues and surround himself with people who can give good advice.\n\nThat's the main job of a president.Jon Stewart also worked tirelessly on the burn pit legislation! These young vets are dying on the daily as a result of exposure to these burn pits. And in some places, the VA has the nerve to deny them of care and compensation. \n\nEven more egregious is that the Dept of Defense knew they were toxic and just didn't give a shit! Unconscionable. \n\nAlso disgusting is the Dept of Defense budget... something you never hear these Republicans complaining about. \n\nSorry, I think OP post triggered me a little.I\u2019m 42. So the veterans I know mostly joined up after 9/11 and older relatives. Honestly, a lot of the guys I knew that joined the Marines after 9/11 probably don\u2019t even vote, they didn\u2019t know what to do with their lives and thought it was good way to get their life in track while serving their country. All my relatives older than me are Republican, but only a couple were in the Army, they are Libertarians. The word Democrat and Liberal feel like an insult here, like almost a slur. In fact, old white guys use the word Democrat when they mean a black person. People here are born into their political party, religion, and football team allegiance.Amen (and yes, a fellow vet).I understand your passion buddy. The point I was making is, both sides have fucked us over for decades. I absolutely refuse to allow some civilian tell the American people that Democrats are champions of Veterans Affairs. Because you and I both know that simply is a lie. Both sides fucked us over and still fuck us over. To say otherwise is to minimize the damage that both parties have caused and that is unacceptable. Both sides must be held responsible.Again like I said to the other Veteran. I am not saying the Republicans are innocent. If you actually read what I said you would notice how I blamed both sides. Unlike yourself who only points the fingers at republicans. Fact of the matter is sarge is that both sides have fucked us over for decades and I absolutely refuse to allow anyone, especially a civilian, minimize that. Both sides are guilty. We as veterans should put both there feet to the fire. That\u2019s why I said what I said. If you disagree then you doing your fellow veterans a disservice. Either blame both sides or take a seatOkay cool bro but unless they told you both sides fucked them over the last 4 decades they didn\u2019t tell you anything really and were simply being partisanYeah I fought for your right to say anything but please respect veterans enough to not make the VA political. Both sides have fucked the VA for years and it wasn\u2019t until Covid that anything was done about it and that was under Trump. You can play make believe that Democrats are champions of VA benefits but everyone who is over 35 knows your full of it. With all due respect>Did you know that last year, the SCOTUS ruled that federal agents protected from civil lawsuits for violating someone's Constitutional rights? That was before the Mar-a-Lago FBI search.\n\nHey hey that's not fair, they're only protected if they are within 100 miles of an international border. Including the oceans. And international airports. They only covers 95% of AmericansAnd neither one of these jerks ever served in the military.It's like they just \"woke\" up one day and decided they wanted this world to go back the 1950sDon't know if you care, but a few of us have tried to change that to \"thank you for your sacrifice\". It feels better since none of us did you a service.\u201cThey want live babies to turn into dead soldiers.\u201d\n\n-George Carlindamn. well said.Of course McCarthy is going to use every available method to thwart the Dem agenda. The question is why haven't the Dems taken away this particular method? Why does Biden himself oppose the abolishment of  the debt ceiling?The needle is moving. Unfortunately, there's not much data on it. Last data I found was from 2009, a world away from today's political climate. \n\nI would say the biggest driver of the votes is money and misinformation about money. Many service members seem to think Republican administrations give the biggest military pay raises and other benefits... Even though that's easily disproven, it is still an argument I see often.as well as pulling up the ladder behind you because somehow you are deserving and it is different for you than the othersAfter the first time Lucy pulls the ball away you blame Lucy, obviously she pulled the ball away and laughed and it, but by the hundredth time you got to start thinking that maybe it's Charlie that's the problem...*medicare cut by republicans* goddamn dirty democrats didn\u2019t stop my Medicare from getting cutGiant billboards.  Title:  The US Economy\".\n\nOne graph charting the US economy over time.  Black line for the data, Red and Blue blocks indicating administrations.  Large swooping arrows over the graph indicating direction trend for super easy viewing.\n\nLegend:\n\nRed - Republicans.  Blue - Democrats.\n\nSlogan:\"Who told you Republicans were good for the economy?\"They just need to repeat republicans are economic terrorists over and over.Yup right there with you.\n\nAnd it amazes me how many in the  same exact boat don\u2019t get they they did not get a tax cut only the wealthy did.  They ignore the fact they pay more now than before.Hey, you live in a \u201cblue\u201d state too? Yeah, I really enjoyed getting shafted by Trump\u2019s tax changes and the targeted reduction of our state and local tax deduction.As much as I loathe Reagan with a fury, I have to admit that he and his snake wife Nancy demonstrated that the presidency is almost purely performative from the public perspective. And actors make excellent front people and tend to be more in tune with their audience.\n\nJon Stewart would definitely be able to do the leadership role and manage public opinion better than most. He doesn't want power though, which is all the more reason he should have it.I hope you can get out of there someday.Bullshit. It's right there in today's news. Republicans want to the US to default unless democrats agree to a 22% cut on all budget items other than the defense budget. That's 22% to VETERAN'S BENFITS. That's right now. 2023. This month.\n\nAt the same time the Whitehouse (Biden) is asking for the biggest service member pay increase in 20 years. I'll give you a clue, it's not the democrats fighting him on this.This both sides shit is fundamentally dishonest. Always is.\n\nNo one is calling dems champions of anything. Stop making up shit.Both sides is cowardly bullshit and you know it man.\n\nOne side is neutered but at least gave us some protections and funding.  The other kicked us to the curb and told us to go fuck ourselves.\n\nStop pretending to be above it all, all you're doing is showing that you're not willing to look reality in the face.  That's how the GOP traps morons.Fucked over has different levels. Would you go with the guy that punched you in the face, or the one that shot you and left you for dead?The VA is inherently political.I am always respectful and I will continue to do what I want to do. With all due respect.This isn't a discussion on when or what the Dems did or didn't do. This discussion is why, given the choice of removing massive tax breaks for the wealthy or cutting veterans care, McCarthy chooses to this. It's very simple. You can take away money for things or you can collect more money in order to meet the same goal. He's choosing to do this. You can deflect the blame to past policy failure but to do so is disingenuous. This person is making this *choice* now.It's a profound lack of empathy, which seems to be a defining characteristic  for right-wing voters.I just clicked print. Good work. Now hit the showers.\u201cI\u2019ve been around for a long time and it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans.\u201d -TrumpfVery purple state actually, but still, fuck Trump and his fucking tax \"break\".I think he'd say he's a comedian. He's so crazy smart, And yes he'd be perfect!With all due respect calling someone a fake Veteran isn\u2019t respectful. All I did was call out both sides for decades of incompetence. Be a cheerleader if you want for the left but unless you are holding both their feet to the fire when talking Veterans Affairs then you come off as someone who is just trying to point fingers at one side. In reality both sides fucked is overThat's the \"don't look behind the curtain\" approach... Doesn't work for meYes. Lack of empathy and a complete sense of entitlement. They deserve everything, laws don\u2019t apply to them, everyone is dumb but them. Pretty much every super republican I know. I got in an argument yesterday in a truck subreddit about how it\u2019s okay for a 14 year old to drive because \u201cit\u2019s a small town\u201d and \u201che probably knows the sheriff\u201d and \u201che\u2019s probably a better driver than you\u201d and \u201che deserves to make a living\u201d. Right there it is in practical use: \u201ceveryone else is dumb, laws don\u2019t apply to me, I deserve things\u201d.I\u2019m sure if it was a black kid in a city they\u2019d sing a different tune\u2026Giant billboard with a graphical chart.  They can shout their feelings at it if they like, but it's really hard to argue against the black-and-white, especially if they have to see it every day during their morning commute.  \n\nThey'll say it's a lie. \n\nThen they'll say \"it feels better under R\".  \n\nThen they'll ignore it.  \n\nThen, eventually, they'll \"Yeah but\" it.  And that's acceptance.  \"Yeah (the economy does worse under Republicans) *but* <worthless nonsense>\".  \n\nOnce we're in the Yeah But territory, we've made gains.  The narrative that the Republicans are good for the economy starts to disintegrate.  Catching new voters on Economy doesn't happen.  They need to use something else.  \n\nThere is no silver bullet.  But there is a way to knock down certain talking points.  Eventually their position becomes untenable.  \n\nIf America survives long enough to see it happen.>...calling someone a fake Veteran isn\u2019t respectful. \n\nwho called anyone a \"fake Veteran\"?That's a nonsensical response. Rip the curtain down! It's still just a idiot making a terrible CHOICE. There is no curtain. There are no \"secret machinations\" making these cuts unavoidable. You're just saying words.Lack of empathy + entitlement= Narcissism \n\nIt's the true defining characteristic of America now and the real issue behind most things. Donald Trump was a textbook narcissist and social media has seriously exacerbated the traits. People already in their me me me bubbles are going from assholes to monsters.You're generous. They'd say it's a lie, skip straight to \"yeah, but\", and then forget they ever gave a fuck about the economy until the next election cycle. Then, they will have conveniently forgot about the billboard because that information was never fully digested. \n\nThese people don't digest unpleasant truths, they reject them and move on to a more comforting thought. They really *really* don't want to engage with the notion that they may be completely wrong about a lot of things. That is the most discomforting thought of all.You don't think there are things going on behind the scenes *in politics*? \n\nLMAO okKeep the billboard up for years and it'll seep in eventually.  If not to them, then to those who are more open minded, those who are coming up into voting ages, etc.  There is a huge group that is 100% lost.  Ignore them.  Target whoever is left.Of course I do. Im just not trying to change the subject to that and act like \"things unseen\" and \"democratic leadership failures\" are the reason a spineless asshat like McCarthy would choose make such a poor decision. The fact that you can't seem to understand the fundamentals of simple math without it being tainted with colors is abhorrent.Keep coming at me with personal attacks and inflammatory words... not just classy but very convincing\n\nMeanwhile, nothing at all \"unseen\" about Joe Biden keeping the debt ceiling in place... [here he is](https://rollcall.com/2022/10/21/biden-dismisses-calls-for-abolishing-debt-limit/) saying it on the record.\n\nAnd a few months later, here we are... *Dems about to cut their own programs because of that very same debt ceiling that Biden supports*.\n\n\"How dare those darn Republicans hold us hostage,\" they'll say... just like they did last time, and like they will the next.

But real-talk, seeing him on tv makes me like him less.\n\nGive us another option. Please. Now is the time - people aren\u2019t even voting FOR anyone, they\u2019re all voting AGAINST the other guy. Let\u2019s try a young, more progressive person.\n\nBiden has done a good job, yes. 100%\u2026 but why not offer us someone who excites us? Someone who will make the changes that reflect what the country wants. Biden is far from progressive - let us progress!!Nobody watches ads anymore.  Spend the money helping sick and hungry kids and you will have done good and people will see it. \n\nFuck political ads.  Let the republicans waste their money on that shit. Nobody who would have voted for trump is gonna watch some ad with Biden kissing a baby in a colorful pasture and think \u201cI love Biden!\u201dYeah. All those other states do not really matter.The swingiest! May it spread over the border.Still a year away from major primaries, just planting seeds to counter the doomer ads already being flung.This is just the appetizer before the main course, the preseason if you willWhat about Georgia and WisconsinThere aren\u2019t physically enough conservatives to make that work very well in the presidential.What are you talking about Democrats won high profile races in all three of the states Biden is launching these ads in, two of them literally ended up more Blue than the blue wave of 2018 legislature wiseIf you can find such a candidate that is also popular among moderates and indies, go aheadI wish we had primaries instead of a political party selecting us a candidate.I think NC is another good target that borders with GA but there's still a lot of work to be done there.>Georgia\n\nThe state that passed the Election Integrity Act of 2021 that still hasn't been defanged, repealed or legally challenged by Biden's DOJ despite their announcement of that lawsuit being over two years ago?\n\n>Wisconsin\n\nThe same Wisconsin that passed a slightly less ridiculously stupid bill for election reform and is the state that quite famously, fairly recently told its black community any white teenager can illegally obtain a firearm and take it to a protest and shoot people and not have any consequences?And AZ.Since when have numbers matter to conservatives? They've never been the majority in this country yet have held power at both the state and federal level almost uninterrupted through American history.\n\nAnd the president isn't elected by popular vote in anyway whatsoever, if that were the case the last republican president would have been Nixon.Maybe it\u2019s just me\u2026 (and I\u2019m ready to be told I\u2019m all alone here) but there is a LOT of space between what I think of \u201cprogressive\u201d and where Joe Biden is. \n\nModerates and indies might not be ready for AOC (sadly, mostly because she\u2019s a woman), but people would be EXCITED to vote for almost ANY \u201cnormal\u201d pick. Again, who is a man\u2026 and between 40 and 55\u2026 and not bernie-level left.God yes please. I\u2019m in NC and a lot of it is very Blue. Especially in the cities. Asheville is the bluest place I\u2019ve ever been. I would love to see some progress. I hate how backwards it is hereGeorgia that elected 2 democrats senators in 2020 and reelected Warnock in November while still having a GOP Governor. It's a purple state in my book.\n\nWisconsin that just elected a liberal in their state supreme court a few weeks ago, giving the appeal of legislative map chances to oust Republicans gerimandering at state and federal level, also protecting us from any presidential general election shenanigans with electors like they tried in 2020.Wisconsin is the prototype of what Republicans want.  Dems win state race 53-47 yet somehow state house is a R supermajority and senate near one (not sure if these still hold true from a few years back).\n\nSo working for a national race there is fine.No, the Wisconsin that just flipped its Supreme Court to liberal.  That Wisconsin.I agree but idk who that option is that would be a guarantee to perform better than Biden electorallyEver been to carrboro?Given senators have nothing to do with the presidential election, this isn't really useful info. Those that elected democratic senators elected a far-right state congress; one that previously only narrowly was prevented from helping Trump win against the wishes of its people, and one that likely won't make the same mistake.\n\nAs far as Wisconsin, I'd love for them to be a blue state. You've got a lot more faith in both state supreme courts and republicans than I do, however.State Supreme Courts don't really matter when the entire state congress is redder than a older white woman being told no.\n\nIf the Liberal judge that made the majority fails to compromise with them, that liberal judge will not be in office long enough to learn which bathroom is the good bathroom to shit in.Georgia, for the first time in idk how long, went for the democratic candidate in 2020, and confirmed this trend with the senators in 2020 and 2022 in the runoffs.I mean you also hung an individual court case on the entire state as one of your key points, so...lol you keep putting qualifers on proof that maybe your first statement wasn't quite right. \n\nWisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania have shown zero sign of moving further right since the 2020 election and in the case of Michigan and Pennsylvania, they've certainly become more blue since Trump won em in 2016.\n\nThat doesn't even get into Arizona, another purple state that refused to move to the right in 2022, which should have been a Republican year....  What is the state legislature going to do to a state Supreme Court justice?[removed]Which is why the passed election reform which Biden's DOJ admits is going to reduce the ability for democratic voters to vote in the 2024 election.[Impeach them and remove them from office](https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-republicans-impeachment-power-process), what the fuck do you mean?Explain then, if you think you know more than a polisci major.\n\nThe Wisconsin State legislature, given they're practically a supermajority republican, can impeach a State Supreme Court Justice, legally, if they believe that justice can no longer perform the functions of their job.\n\nIf you think the state supreme court can do anything without explicit republican permission when they hold the keys to the court's power, **You don't know enough politics to comment on it, much less be a dick to others.**Democrats will do everything they can to get as many to vote as possible, while Republicans have to get people excited about trying to put Trump back in office.\n\nVoters will get to hear Trump\u2019s voice on that \u201cperfect phone call\u201d over and over, while hearing other details from his upcoming criminal trial.You need to calm down, this is a discussion, not an argument.\n\nThey have *had* that supermajority before that state senator retired.  This isn't new for them.>\tSo if the Republican Legislature were to remove a Supreme Court justice, the next justice would be picked by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.Trump won't go to trial before 2024 for any election relate crimes, it will be June before a grand jury in the Georgia case even sees any evidence to try to indict him -- and if this Stormy Daniels shit fails to materialize in trial before 2024, which it will given jury selection alone will likely take until early 2024, you lose voter confidence in Trump's guilt.\n\nRepublicans have to just point to their voter's lives as well as the outrage from the democrats to inspire their voters. Democrats have to convince their voters it is materially safe for them to practically publicly vote for what has the chance to not only be the minority party, but the minority party that republicans are calling for vigilante violence against and have placed judges across the nation to protect those vigilantes.Which they can just remove again.\n\nI'm sorry but where in the actual fuck have you been the last 15 years? Why the fuck do you think republicans are bad at stalling and utilizing bureaucracy as a weapon against people operating under the assumption there are any checks and balances in place?The next panels of grand jurors will be sworn in May 1st.  It\u2019ll last for 2 months and then if Trump is indicted he can request for a speedy trial to start 2 months after that.  So it is still possible that a trial can start in September, if Trump tries to run it and give Willis little additional time to prepare.  Could be a good strategy as there could be multiple indictments from this and they would all have a right to a speedy trial.  Although some could agree to cooperate and turn on Trump.\n\nEither way regardless if starts this year or next, it is bad for Trump.  There\u2019s also no stopping the Federal trial.\n\nEveryone knows that Trump is guilty of a lot and with Fox News becoming more cautious it\u2019ll be more difficult to spread lies effectively.They can try to do it today, but it\u2019s been proven over and over again that some Republicans feel that blowing up the government is a bridge too far.\n\nI don\u2019t see it happening, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it did once.There's no stopping the federal trial unless it fails to conclude before Trump is sworn in. If Trump's sworn in, the federal trial stops.\n\nI just don't believe we have the timeline available given Trump's expertise in extending and prolonging court cases for literally decades -- and I don't believe we should get hopeful for those cases just existing to have any impact on Trump's elect-ability. This comment section is just proof of that.\n\nRepublicans believe they are in a war for their souls and their children; literally believing democrats want to make it legal to SA kids -- look at any street interview where republicans congregate.\n\nDemocratic voters, for the most part, don't believe the government functions and historically and even contemporarily have failed to come out in high enough numbers to overcome gerrymandering.\n\nQuite frankly, the republican party has convinced its voters this election is life or death. The Democratic party has convinced a majority of its potential voters that it is entirely incompetent and anti-democratic, that all government is incompetent, and by extension they should just move to a blue state which would surrender federal power to republicans.\n\nI hope I'm wrong but I also predicted, the moment Clinton was announced as a candidate for 2016, that the dems would lose. \n\nI fully believe die hard democrat party sycophants are as blind to the plight of the average person now as they were in 2016 when they put the most unelectable piece of shit against someone with actual strategy.If you know Trump\u2019s legal strategy, future judges are certainly very aware.  They will give Trump some leeway early on and then they will likely stop the shenanigans.  Either way all of the suits become a greater risk for large donors.  Why spend money on Trump when he already lost, and they can spend that money more effectively on House and Senate races?  Plus Trump is raiding his campaign funds to pay for lawyers.\n\nSuccess for Trump is staying out of jail, not passing policies.  Even if he is elected, if Republicans give up the House and Senate the following election he could be successfully impeached.  Mitch McConnell isn\u2019t getting any younger, so the Senate will be in turmoil soon.",

Oh wait lolIt wouldn\u2019t be controversial for school dress codes to prevent students from wearing a shirt that says \u201cFuck so and so,\u201d so why should a cheeky way of saying \u201cFuck so and so\u201d be permitted?TLDR - Parents use their kids to express their own political ideology at a school and then suing when they are told they can\u2019t. PatheticI wasn't allowed to wear terrorist slogans in school either. I made it through just fine.I\u2019m with the school on this.  That statement isn\u2019t a conversation starter, it\u2019s a middle finger to everyone not using the statement.  Something tells me the students in question aren\u2019t even in the passing percentage for GPA.Something tells me these people would have a big problem if the school allowed Black Lives Matter or Trans Lives Matter shirts to be worn.They\u2019re doing this wrong - just buy the kids DNC \u201cDark Brandon\u201d t-shirts to wear home.If there are kids that want to wear a \"Let's Go Brandon\" sweatshirt, they should be allowed to.\n\nIt tells their fellow students and peers who the narcs and date rapists are. No place at school for political statements.  \nIt leads fights and bullyingWhen I see this slogan I take it as support for Joe Biden. I would bet that more voters recognize that Brandon refers to Joe Biden than recognize that \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d means something else.Dark Brandon is where it's at.To the parents.  Bravo. Good job. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nYou've got to be taught\nTo hate and fear,\nYou've got to be taught\nFrom year to year,\nIt's got to be drummed\nIn your dear little ear\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\nYou've got to be taught to be afraid\nOf people whose eyes are oddly made,\nAnd people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,\nYou've got to be carefully taught.\n\nYou've got to be taught before it's too late,\nBefore you are six or seven or eight,\nTo hate all the people your relatives hate,\nYou've got to be carefully taught!Disagree with the school\u2019s decision here. Those hoodies are great obvious red flag for girls in that school.I think the schools in the right here. It\u2019s specifically criticize is the president in a derogatory manner. It means fuck Joe Biden. I would disagree with the mother when she says it\u2019s a conversation starter.Let's fuck Brandon!If kids want to wear an \u201cI\u2019m a raging asshole\u201d shirt, I say let \u2018em.Technically this is against the 1st. They are going to win.It makes sense. It's slang for Fuck Joe Biden. You can't wear swear words at school, even if you make up new slang words.When he gets back on Monday he\u2019s going to\u2026.\n\n*smug chortling ensues*\nDoes Tucker Carlson like shitting his pants? I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019m not saying that he does; I\u2019m just asking questions, here. But what I do know is\u2026 I\u2019ve never been in the same room as Tucker Carlson when he shit his pants and didn\u2019t enjoy it\u2026 and neither has anyone else I\u2019ve ever asked. Now, maybe that\u2019s just a coincidence. But maybe not. Surely, for someone as well known and popular as Tucker Carlson, there would be at least one person out there who was in the same room as Tucker Carlson when he shit his pants and then complained about having incontinence issues. If so, where are they? I think its telling that no such person has ever come forward.[deleted]Because the shirt doesn't say \"fuck so and so\"\n\nIt says let's go Brandon.  \n\nLook I'm the first to say the whole FJB/LGB thing is pants on head stupid and child like, but so is getting worked up over someone saying it or wearing it.I dunno, I saw several Che Guevara shirts when I went to school.Implying this phrase is a terrorist slogan? Lol>One man's vulgarity is another man's lyric.  \n>  \n>\u2014 John Marshall HarlanThis is the correct answer.I\u2019m stocking up on my Joe Biden merch!Thank you! Finally someone who gets it!Everything now days can be a political statementhttps://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/21I would bet you are wrong.The slogan is supposed to be sarcastic.Actually school districts quite often win when it comes to dress codes. But it is true parents are allowed to teach their children hate.Schools have dress codes and have consistently been exonerated when they enforce those codes.Could you elaborate? I\u2019m not too familiar with this. How is it different from all the other things/slogans you can\u2019t wear in school?If only there were some sort of article you could read that went over different cases decided by the supreme court concerning the first amendment and school dress codes. That juxtaposition to this case might really provide some insight.No, it isn't. The first amendment protects you from being persecuted by the government for your speech. Schools can, and will, ban clothes that are disruptive to the learning environment. Very legal & very cool.It's a phrase that includes a coded curse word. That's why it (but not other, benign political expressions) should be banned.\n\n And that's an easy thing to understand, unless you want to bait the administration of a public school to act against it so you can cry persecution and sue them.Schools ban guns, technically against the 2nd. They are going to lose.[deleted]Like Bill O'reilly? LOL.\n\nFucker Carlson podcast.He likely can't... legally. There is a high likelihood that Fox has his contract stitched up in that regard as is standard in those kinds of contracts.\n\nTo say nothing of the fact that word on the street is they're still paying him until his contract runs out which would only strengthen any form of non-compete clause that they most likely have.Worked in a high school for twenty years. Supreme Court has ruled, that a school can limit free speech for students. Wearing political shirts, is one of those instances.I would imagine they also ban MAGA and ISIS shirts; I don't think anyone except the brainwashed little shits in the lawsuit \"got worked up,\" it's a matter of course.\n\nNext you're going to say it's outrageous some schools ban students from wearing red armbands and long leather coats with eagles and peace symbols on it.It's still a profane statement. It's the same thing as wearing a shirt that says \"Vulcanize the whoopie stick in the ham wallet\". Also, need I remind people that schools have dress codes, and I'm sure politically charged clothing is apart of that.We all know what it means. \n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of other clothing you could wear that expresses a political view that would be school appropriate, but saying fuck so-and-so probably doesn\u2019t belong in school.Schools often ban things that have an innendo to them, or that they think has innuendo.  High school kids love to wear shirts like that to be funny.  So, I don't think it is unreasonable to ban a shirt that has an innuendo to saying the word fuck on it.  However, this is more difficult because it also can be considered political speech.  I'm on the fence about it.  I don't think a MAGA shirt or something like that should be banned, but one that has a curse word innuendo certainly seems more reasonable.Can't catch them all.  Ignorance and simply not noticing probably plays a role.  I might be going out on a limb but I'm betting these let's go Brandon kids were walking around like huge attention whoring assholes and now are playing their other favorite card, the victim card.  When you do stuff like that you draw eyeballs and thus enforcement.Well it is the rally cry of a specific set of political activists who wish to subjugate women.Conservatives openly and proudly displayed that they are all domestic terrorists.\n\nSo, their rallying cry of \"LET'S GO BRANDON!\" would be a terrorist slogan.Yes, the people that say it are from a known extremist ideology that tried to overthrow a Democratic election through violence in the last election. That's the very definition of terrorism.Well, it is.  Depends how you link it to J6, etc, I believebi saw it a bunch of times on the film, does that make it a terrorist slogan?  I'm going with yesBut this is at school?And they have consistently been told they were wrong when they ban political speech.Because it a euphemism for fuck you biden and people still think fuck is a super bad word.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillman_v._Holmes_County_School_Districthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_DistrictConsidering that banning somebody from wearing a red trump hat is actually not legal.\u2026 and a violation of the 1st just as much as banning the pride flag or blm flags is also against the 1st\u2026.\n\nI have watched cases against the red trump hat fail repeatedly. Just as much as I have seen cases against the pride flag fail repeatedly.\n\n\nTINKER.https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/teacher-trump-maga-hat-free-speech-washington\n\nLook if the Trump hat is allowed,  this is probably allowed to. It doesn\u2019t actually say the word fuck. I don\u2019t even necessarily agree that the word fuck is vulgar so lol. \n\n\nThis is such a silly thing. I cannot believe other Democrats aren\u2019t for free-speech. Especially after all we\u2019ve gone through.\n\n\nI spent a heck of a lot of time hating Donald Trump. And I would hate it if I wasn\u2019t allowed to express my displeasure.I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to lose. It doesn\u2019t actually say the word fuck. Students are allowed to express not liking the president. Whether you like it or not.\n\nI don\u2019t like trump. And I support Biden. But I know that this is fully within the first amendment.Yeah they should win. Unless they were doing it in an overly distracting way. Which doesn\u2019t sound like they were. Sounds open and shut.Meanwhile when I was a kid Bart Simpson tshirts were banned in some schools. Nobody blew a first amendment gasketDon\u2019t students have a right to free speech as decided in Tinker versus Des Moines? They upheld the students right to wear a black arm band in protest of the Vietnam war.Tinker v Des Moines upheld black armbands as protected political protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nIt\u2019s a little weird you\u2019d say generically that SCOTUS has ruled schools can limit free speech in political shirts.\n\nThere\u2019s more nuance than a simple yes or no (like applying the Tinker substantial disruption test) but if were going to comment exactly one way or the other on political shirts, the answer should probably be that it is protected in schools.Calling someone you disagree with a Nazi or Nazi sympathizer is such an old trope now. I'm simply saying the shirt doesn't say anything profane on it's surface. Using kids politically, by anyone, is messed up.It is the difference between \"what the fuck\" and \"wtf\" or \"God damn\" and \"gd\". Generally speaking, I would not expect a student to be punished for saying \"wtf\" in school, because it is not vulgar. If the \"LGB\" shirts impeded the educational mission of the school or incited chants of \"fuck Joe Biden\", then the school would have a stronger argument. \"LGB\" is stupid but not vulgar.That shirt wouldn't be profane either.Around here they just dealt with clothes issues by instituting uniforms in public school. Some parents were very angry about the cost, but that went away very quickly because they soon realized it costs much less than your kids playing \"fashion show\" every day they go to school.No it doesn't, but that's not what it actually says.And to those who want to overthrow the government(Jan 6th) so yes domestic terroism No it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just a way to show disapproval of the president. It\u2019s not like Trump lacked phrases that were said to him.That\u2019s some crazy logic.It\u2019s not extremist, it came from some random guy in a stadium, it got popular and is used to make fun of the president.*Cohen v California* is the base that *Tinker v Des Moines*, *Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier*, and subsequent cases look towards.\n\nUnfortunately, speech in schools is straying further away from *Cohen* and *Tinker* and beginning to look more like the dissenting opinion in *Cohen*:\n\n> I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.  \n>  \n>\u2014 Hugo Black\n\nCases like  *Hardwick v. Heyward* and *Dariano v. Morgan Hill Unified School District* show that \"disruptive\" is relative.Should I be a able to wear a green shirt with number 420 on it at school?Man, if only there were some article that brought up this exact case and compared and contrasted it to other cases.The black arm band which meant you did not support the Vietnam war you were in the morning because you thought it was a bad decision is way different than a shirt that means fuck Joe Biden. LoLNo hats in school.I mean my school district had it with us in the 2000s with band and rapper t's and the complementing jeans styles that they implemented a dress code. Khaki pants, blue, gray or white collared shirt and a belt. Then they had to ban footwear, the idea of wearing a hat to school was also non existent and if you wanted to wear sun glasses indoors you better have a prescription. Larger school districts have been dealing with this for decades and they have solutions for it.It's because the shirt is a euphemism for \"Fuck you\" which is 100% not allowed in school. Trump hats may be offensive to me because of what they stand for, but they aren't vulgar.Banning someone from wearing a Trump hat is not illegal. Where did you get the idea it was?Do schools even allow hats at all?  I don't remember being able to wear them.It's not a left right thing.  If you're going to have dress codes then this sort of thing has to be banned.  They are huge distractions and it's not political persecution to stop it.  It's anti asshole who thinks they can do and say whatever as long as it is coded.No one said anything about democrats in this article\u2026I would be cool if teachers wanted to wear a maga hat. It isnt expressing anything inherently profane.>wrote the judge, Danielle J Forrest, a Trump appointee.If the school can restrict the 2nd amendment, they can restrict the 1st.I had a Far Side t-shirt where 3 dinosaurs were smoking and the caption was, \"The real reason the dinosaurs became extinct.\"\n\nI was barred from wearing that shirt because it, \"had people smoking on it\" but other  students walked around with Big Johnson shirts without a word being said.I would absolutely agree however I will say it's absolutely ironic that these students are getting into an uproar about this but I'm sure they would be silent about the don't say gay bill in Florida. With conservatives it's always free speech for me and not for thee.>Calling someone you disagree with a Nazi or Nazi sympathizer is such an old trope now.\n\nIf the people rightly being called nazis would stop treating text books as instruction manuals and maybe people will stop calling them a nazi.\n\n>I'm simply saying the shirt doesn't say anything profane on it's surface.\n\nIt's a phrase popularized by a recognized domestic terrorist entity, the only one to kill someone in congress in the last century in a half.\n\nIt's not about profanity, which shouldn't even be censored.But we all know the meaning behind it?\"WTF\" is every bit as vulgar as \"What the fuck\". Language is constantly in flux, and vulgarity doesn't magically disappear when tucked into a code when literally everyone understands that code. It's like arguing that a shirt that says \"Fuck Joe Biden\" should be disallowed but one that says \"Fcuk Joe Biden\" is fine.\n\nThe word \"fuck\" is just considered less vulgar today than it was \\~20 years ago, which is again part of the normal pattern of language. 150 years ago saying \"What in tarnation?\" would have been considered obscene.>... I would not expect a student to be punished for saying \"wtf\" in school, because it is not vulgar...\n\nI hope you like surprises.By that logic a BLM shirt is a terrorist slogan.>That\u2019s some crazy logic.\n\nClaiming that a group of self identified terrorists using a slogan as a rallying cry makes that rallying cry a terrorist slogan is \\*\\*accurate\\*\\*.\n\nClaiming anything else is simply incompetent, no matter how much you lie about the logic being \"crazy\".This sub has no logic. Its a huge circle jerk of conservative bad! Liberals good!Who made it up has no bearing on anything. It was co-opted by an extremist ideology.Yeah. But they wont agree. :/ \n\nKids got in trouble for a shirt that said \u201cdrugs suck\u201dUnless you think this is like the \u201cdrugs suck\u201d case\u2026. Which I really didn\u2019t agree with that ruling so\u2026https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillman_v._Holmes_County_School_District:/ very confused rnhttps://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/teacher-trump-maga-hat-free-speech-washington\n\nThis literally happened within my own school district. You won\u2019t winSo you agree with the idea that children shouldn\u2019t be allowed to wear pride pins? And shouldn\u2019t be allowed to express that they don\u2019t approve of the president?\n\n\nI wore a Kids for Kerry pin to school in 2004.\nI think a euphemism for \u201cfuck you\u201d isn\u2019t really vulgar. Also I don\u2019t even think the word fuck is that vulgar, and it\u2019s always bothered me that people continually think that words a bad word and not slurs moreso.https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/04/teacher-trump-maga-hat-free-speech-washington\n\nThis happened in my own school district lolI had my coat taken away from me and it was a trenchcoat and it was my only coat. Do you think that was OK?\n\n\nDo you think it\u2019s OK for coats to be stolen from little girls in the winter?\n\n\nMy coat was pink. They protected me from the rain. It was suitable to the climate I\u2019m in. And the teacher took it because I could\u2019ve had a gun in it.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-wins-anti-bush-shirt-clash/This is an anti-biden shirt. And people are agreeing with censorshipAre you fighting book bans like I am?Yeah and what is the supreme court right now?Actually it's the federal Gun-Free School Zone act of 19990 and the Gun-Free School Act of 1994 that bans guns in schools.\n\nSchool administration has nothing to do with it.[deleted]It was all pick and choose, even for the same person.  I was allowed wear my Cannibal Corpse \"Eaten Back to Life\" shirt all of middle school (96-98) but was banned from wearing a Half Baked shirt and other WAY less offensive band shirts.  Go figure?I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what irony means.  Maybe hypocrisy, but obviously people have differing values.\n\nDon\u2019t say gay doesn\u2019t mean students can\u2019t say gay, or wear it on clothes.  Teachers, as employees and representatives of the State do not have the same 1A protections as students, who are required by the state to be there.> \"WTF\" is every bit as vulgar as \"What the fuck\". \n\nReasonable minds can disagree on that. I think that the FCC allows \"wtf\" to be broadcast over the air on non-cable tv and radio stations but not \"what the fuck\"; and I infer that that is because it does not view the terms to be equally vulgar. Unlike your hypothetical where the obscene word is intentionally misspelled, the obscene word here does not appear at all. It's possible that two phrases may be so ubiquitously linked that they cannot be separated, although the subject of the phrase \"LGB\" obviously did not know what it meant when someone said it to him and he repeated it.What the fudge?!Not liking the president isn\u2019t t extremist ideology.All right, so you aren't getting it. Fair enough. \n\nThe article OP posted talks about these cases, and it's not complicated to grasp. The Supreme Court has generally upheld that schools cannot ban political speech, but it has allowed them to ban vulgar speech. Even if that speech isn't directly vulgar (i.e. not using curse words) they have been allowed to ban it. \n\nSo, this particular case is interesting because it's definitely political speech, which is protected. However, it's also referencing a vulgar expression. \n\nHonestly, it will be interesting to see how it plays out, but this is not a clear-cut case of a 1st amendment violation.Non sequitur. That case is about a teacher who wore a hat to a staff only event.\n\nStudents are not allowed to wear hats in school during the school day.[deleted]Pride pins aren't inherently political. It's really only because of one side that they are, which ironically is the same side that you seem to be defending.\n\nAlso, supporting a political candidate is not the same as supporting a group of people or even a cause. \"I support trans rights\" should not be politically charged and thus disruptive in the same way as \"I support Nazis\" would be.\n\nIf you can't see that... then I don't think you're going to see eye to eye with anyone here as your interpretation of freedom seems to ignore context entirely.\n\nThough to me if we're going to start allowing politics in schools then the voting age should be lowered. If the voting age isn't going to be lowered, then keep all politics (inherent politics, not just things that one side wants to make into politics) out of schools and most definitely avoid things that would be disruptive as there are a lot of kids (and their parents) who do this shit specifically because they want to be disruptive.Wow, I guess I was wrong. Here in Wisconsin, schools don't allow anyone to wear hats. Most schools here have dress codes that are easily enforced.That's not what this is.  But nice attempt at a straw man argument.Chris Schiano's T-shirt said \"International Terrorist\" and had a picture of President Bush.\n\nIt\u2019s totally different than a maga hat and different from a shirt that slogan means fuck Joe Biden.Cool, care to explain how this is exactly the same as that?And those people are automatically democrats?The phrase on the shirt means fuck Joe Biden. That\u2019s totally different than a Maga hat.I\u2019m not inherently against book bans. I don\u2019t care for the way that people like Ron DeSantis are going about it and the way he politicizes it but if you wanted to have your school district audit, the books in the library to see if everything is age-appropriate I\u2019m not against it.If it makes it that far I have no doubts about how the court will rule. The reality is that having a shirt that effectively says \"fuck Joe Biden\" is something a school can ban as part of its dress code. It would fall under any rules banning expletives on clothing, which I have zero doubt this school has.There is. But a Right is a Right. And restricting the 2nd sets precedence for restricting the 1st.\n\nAnd you better hope that holds, because upholding the 1st means they can challenge the 2nd, and then our schools are all shooting ranges.Couldn't wear my pot leaf shirt and several of my rock and punk shirts in high school. \n\nI certainly wasn't running to the media or a lawyer because I couldn't wear my Melvins shirt that said \"pussy\" on the back.I wasn't allowed to wear an Iron Maiden Trooper shirt because Eddie was holding a sabre.It is directly applicable. The only reason students have any kind of free speech rights in schools is because the state is the one who owns the schools.\n\nEmployees of the school also have free speech rights and those rights are being violated by their employer dictating what they can and cannot say. We don't allow the federal government to basically prevent people who work for it to go to protests or speak their mind. Why would we allow state governments to do so? \n\nOf course the Supreme Court seems to forget that we have a 14th amendment. The law may ultimately be struck down. My point was that these same students would not have such a high-minded opinion about free speech if it was something they didn't like.\n\nYou are right however, it is more hypocrisy than irony. The irony I was referring to is that abstensively liberal schools are using the same arguments that conservative use to limit free speech.The FCC's position is just a consequence of the inherent near-impossibility of categorizing what is and is not vulgar to begin with. I don't think their position is necessarily that \"WTF\" is less vulgar than \"What the fuck\" so much as them being fine with being inconsistent, because ultimately, some kind of inconsistency is inevitable in these value judgments.\n\n\"WTF\" for \"What the fuck\" didn't enter into the lexicon until the Internet came into being (interestingly, \"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot\" appears to predate it), and keeping up with modern lexicon doesn't appear to be something the FCC is particularly interested in.\n\nIt's not hard to point out the ridiculousness of their base position to begin with - George Carlin's famous \"7 words\" sketch is from, what, 1972? - so I think treating their standards as a reasonable baseline for what is and is not \"vulgar\" is questionable.\n\nBut like you say, it's a position on which reasonable people can certainly disagree (helped by the fact \"vulgarity\" as a concept is so fuzzy and vague to begin with).Why the face?That wasn't what I said. I made a pretty clear statement. Feel free to reread the thread.Yeah but I disagree with the \u201cdrugs suck\u201d ruling so I\u2019m going to keep fighting that.\n\nUnless you agree that the words suck in the term \u201cdrugs suck\u201d has a sexual connotation, then we are really gonna have to disagree hardDo you really want the school to be allowed to say you\u2019re not allowed to say you don\u2019t like the sitting president???? They sided with the students in tinker. Students have the right to political speech. yes even on school grounds. And we have been fighting huge free-speech fights when it comes to library books. Do you really wanna push this idea that students don\u2019t have the right to free speech?I wore a Kids for Kerry pin in 2004 in 8th grade. I was pretty vocally against George W. Bush. Pro-Obama my senior year of high school. Lotta people were. As an adult I became against Donald Trump. The whole time. And I support Joe Biden. But people have the right to not like Joe Biden.You do understand that technically all this shirt is saying is that they don\u2019t like Joe Biden right? I know it\u2019s connected to a bunch of other stuff, and it\u2019s like a fucking Vietnam War flashback, I understand cause it\u2019s like that for me too, but technically the only thing the shirt actually does is say they don\u2019t like Joe Biden. \n\n\nDo you really want to say that not liking the sitting president is the same thing as being a Nazi?This was a teacher, wearing it to an event. Not the same as students and wearing them in school/class.Dress codes are considered violations of the first amendment if they\u2019re strict enough. Like if they\u2019re at the school uniform level, yeah that\u2019s a violation. \n\n\ufffcNot a strawman argument. It is a dress code. And you are defending them\n\nSchool says no hats no trench coats even in a cold environment where it rains a lot and that\u2019s a pretty big deal.I\u2019m a democrat so I assume other biden supporters are.Do you agree with book banners?Are you against the word \u201cfuck\u201d when it appears in books?\nIf a teacher wants to test the limits of the bill by speaking on LGBTQ subjects at school, not during classroom instruction, as political protest or speech, fine. \n\nBut that\u2019s not the same thing as saying sexual orientation and gender identity in classroom instruction is not permitted in K-3.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t conflate instruction and individual political speech.  Otherwise no state or locality can set standards for instruction.I don't care if you agree with the ruling, you aren't a supreme court justice. The only thing I care about is your initial statement.\n\n> Technically this is against the 1st. They are going to win.\n\nWhile I get this is what you want to happen, but it is not clear at all this is how it will play out based on the other cases.I'm sorry are you saying that hats *should* be allowed in school? Because I've never really understood why they were so adamant about that.I agree that people have the right to not like Joe Biden. But as I said in my other comment, that's not what this is. Even if it were what this was (which again, it isn't) the mere fact that it is effectively designed to be disruptive makes it inappropriate for school. To say nothing of the fact that your \"agreement' about vulgar words is not necessary for schools to decide that vulgar language even coded is inappropriate.\n\nMy issue with all of this is that it takes an absolutist point of view on freedom and you simply cannot have absolute freedom, it doesn't work. YOUR freedom will come into conflict with MY freedom if you pull absolute freedom. In the case of schooling this whole thing seems like an attempt to deliberately try to push this kind of toxic politics into schools. Basically your anecdotal reference to a Kerry pin is a good example of something that isn't disruptive or intended to cause disruptive vs something that very much is.\n\nMoreover, the issue is that Trump is a toxic and controversial person even within Republican circles. Joe Biden is only toxic and controversial to conservatives and only because they've created this environment. So don't pretend like this is the same as you wearing a Kerry pin, because there's a whole different environment here that you seem to be ignoring.>Do you really want to say that not liking the sitting president is the same thing as being a Nazi?\n\nYeah it's not though is it? Let's Go Brandon is a MAGA symbol. MAGA had literal Nazis marching in support of it. So... yeah I am going to make that statement as this isn't a shirt worn by people simply disliking Biden.\n\nAn absolute ton of Democrats do not like Biden and I imagine you wouldn't see them caught dead in a \"Let's go Brandon\" shirt. Why is that I wonder? Could it be because **it isn't strictly a statement against Biden?** and even if it was the nature of that statement is itself intended to be controversial which is by extension an attempt to disrupt.\n\nSo yeah 1. It isn't simply a statement of disliking Biden, it's literally a statement by a side with literal Nazis 2. It is disruptive by nature. 3. Kids can't vote. If you want them to be able to exercise inherent political speech in school then let them vote.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with kids supporting or not supporting or even disliking or hating a candidate. But keep that shit out of the schools. Especially since it is so painfully obvious that a lot of MAGA parents are pushing not just their MAGA beliefs onto their children but also the desire to be disruptive in that setting because the very real actual Nazis in the GOP (No seriously, salute and all) are waging a war against education which means there is a veritable pipeline of parents getting their kids to be disruptive in schools as an extension of their parents own *protest*. And I'm all for protest, political or otherwise but if you want to protest there is a right way and a wrong way and simply trying to be disruptive because the person you support wants that is not protest.I don't think the nazi thing was a comparison, more of an easy target to prove a point.  He/she has a point here.  The language is coded but it is what it is.  Gang symbolism and other coded language is also not allowed.  If everyone started wearing purple armbands one day because they hate a certain race and the administration found out the reason, those would be banned in a jiffy even though they don't themselves outwardly and directly mean that.It depends on where you are. I don't consider it a violation, and the courts in this area of the country tend to agree.Depends on the book and what age kids are reading it. Should elementary students be given an unabridged version of IT with it\u2019s child orgy or cujo with the main character masturbating no. High schoolers could though and maybe middle schoolers?lol, obviously not. But schools don't let kids wear shirts that say \"fuck\" on them. Having a dress code isn't equal to banning books.It absolutely is because they don't mean sexual orientation or gender identity. What they mean is homosexual, bisexual, etc sexual orientation and trans gender identity. They are perfectly fine with someone talking about their spouse of their heterosexual and their masculinity or femininity if that matches their sex.With how the court is stacked now? I just don\u2019t see it.I wore hats cause I had ear aches and found no hat rules especially painful.\n\nI also got my pink trench taken from me\u2026 it was my only coat\u2026 it was also late fall early winter.Preferably I\u2019d like it if nobody liked Trump. Preferably I\u2019d like it if nobody said shitty things about Biden. But that\u2019s not the world we live in unfortunately.\n\n\nMy preference is to allow hats that cover ears and are worn for the purpose of being warmOK so my trenchcoat disturbed you so you stole my coat\n\n\nAnd you think it\u2019s justified the teacher stole it when I was 12 years old. And all winter long I came to school with no coat because the teacher stole my only coat.\n\n\nMy coat was pink. It had no words on it. But the teacher was allowed to steal my coat because it was a trenchcoat.\n\nMy trenchcoat was considered destructive because it was symbolic of the trenchcoat mafia. And gun violence. But I didn\u2019t know about that. I was just wearing a pink trenchcoathttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-wins-anti-bush-shirt-clash/\n\nSaying you don\u2019t like the president isn\u2019t really the same thing as being a NaziI guess the Pacific Northwest is just really used to being very free lolCan they read it??\n\nKinda the cool thing about books\u2026.OK but do schools let kids wear the word hate on their shirt? Or any replacement words like darn?\n\n\nAnd I was blocked. This is such a stupid fucking thing. This is like on a whole level of stupid. I don\u2019t understand even why you were this upset.\n\nFeeding Trump supporters persecution complex isn\u2019t really something that should be done. I\u2019m sorryI think it kind of is. Since dress codes are frequently Weaponized against girls. And I will always be against them\n\n\nSeriously I am very confused as to how many people are jumping my ass about this. Like I really thought I said something completely not controversial that most left-wing people would agree withA political slogan on sweatshirt is clearly political speech.  You might equate that with talking about personal gender identity or sexual orientation, but not everyone has to agree.  that\u2019s the tension.\n\n\nIf it is protected speech, then the bill can\u2019t be enforced.  If it\u2019s not, then it isn\u2019t protected.  You can\u2019t have it both ways.Well you can sue based on what the bill says, and later based on what the admin does.  Not sure you can sue based on what you think it means (but doesn\u2019t say).\n\nYou\u2019re free to speculate on what the bill means and therefore makes those students hypocrites, but that presumes they agree with you.\n\nClearly they\u2019re not very bright tho\u2026.Let's go back to the tape.\n\n> Technically this is against the 1st.\n\nAs we have seen in other cases, it is not \"technically\" against the first. It hinges on whether the associated vulgarity of the phrase is enough.\n\n> They are going to win.\n\nStacked court or not, this isn't an abortion ruling or states right issue that they might have strong political feelings for. Can a school stop a student from wearing a shirt that says \"Let's go, Brandon\" because it references a vulgar phrase? They could just as easily decide based on previous rulings and call it done.But that's not what the shirt means.\n\nYou're watering it down purposely and no one is saying it is the same thing as being a nazi. You're the one drawing that comparisonI don't feel any less free here. Good luck out there.Dude, you're really getting into the weeds trying to make this ok. I'm not debating other words.They could also say it does not actually say the vulgar phrase and it\u2019s political speech.\n\n\nIt\u2019s no different than saying stuff instead of shit. Or enjoying your movie called that darn cat instead of that damn catI\u2019m very confused then. Because it\u2019s just stating they don\u2019t like Joe Biden.Are you saying multiple precedents exist for cases like this, and as such, it might go either way? Because that would mean there is no way to know if it was \"technically\" a first amendment violation, or if the plaintiffs are going to win.That's not only what it's saying.  Try googling what does let's go Brandon mean?\n\nThe word fuck whether YOU like it or not doesn't just mean you don't like something. It has a stronger and more violent connotation than You are painting it.  You can disagree, but society doesn't.  And schools have to walk a fine line between what is socially acceptable and what isn't so I respect that they've chosen to ban a phrase that is a coded phrase meaning fuck so and soIt technically is. I would be pretty upset if I wore a shirt saying how much I don\u2019t like bush and got in trouble. Like the #1 terrorist bush shirts.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-wins-anti-bush-shirt-clash/What is the violent connotation of the word fuck? I don\u2019t see any.  There\u2019s certainly a more violent connotation with the word hate. But we don\u2019t ban that ?\n\nIf someone came to school with the words I hate Donald Trump, you wouldn\u2019t ban that person\u2018s shirt. \n\nBut we know the word heat is a lot more strong than the word dislike. And we know what hate is\u2026Wow! Even after OP posted an article, and I summarized and explained it, you just skipped over the actual point of contention. Neat.Do you just post articles without reading them?\n\n> It had no references to sex, drugs, ethnic intimidation or explicit language.Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  Sorry you disagree but it's the same as saying fuck Joe Biden and that is not protected speech.  Now will the courts look hard enough at it to see that it is coded words?  I don't know.  And always the possibility of getting a right wing judge that throws out all common sense and precedent.  So I'm not giving it a 100% chance of failure but this lawsuit should probably fail.Yeah because it doesn\u2019t actually say the word so it\u2019s not. i\u2019m very fucking confused right now especially because I\u2019m autistic I\u2019m just gonna assume it\u2019s because I\u2019m autistic that I don\u2019t understand anything you guys are telling me. And I think you guys are being a bunch of idiots. It does not say fuck. It says let\u2019s go Brandon. What\u2019s offensive about that?\n\n\n\nfirst of all you\u2019d have to consider the word fuck vulgar in the first place. And since I don\u2019t, we are already off to a bad start.There is no explicit language so I\u2019m very confused.Calling George W. Bush a terrorist is considered AOK. So how is that any different from the word fuck?\n\nI certainly have a lot more violent imagery in my head over the word terrorist.\n\n\nAnti-Obama people frequently said that Obama was a war criminal, even more so than they called George W. Bush a war criminal. And in a way that I thought was pretty unfair> It does not say fuck. It says let\u2019s go Brandon. What\u2019s offensive about that?\n\nIf only there were an article (maybe posted by OP) that specifically went over how the supreme court had handled scenarios where the clothing itself didn't contain any actual explicit content.>And since I don\u2019t, we are already off to a bad start.\n\nWhat you find vulgar isn't relevant at all to any piece of this.  So we're off to a perfectly fine start.Very very confused.[removed]I read the whole thing from beginning to end. So I do not know what you\u2019re talking about. If only there was an article because this one didn\u2019t fucking explain it good enough.\n\n\nThe word fuck is not explicit. End of story. Fuck is not a bad word.\n\n\nSo I am very confused upon reading the article because even what it eludes to isn\u2019t bad.So you are for banning books?Yeah especially since we are currently fighting these book bans where we are saying that there\u2019s no explicit content in the books.\ufffc> I read the whole thing from beginning to end. So I do not know what you\u2019re talking about. If only there wine article because this one didn\u2019t fucking explain it good enough.\n\nTry rereading it slower. Foucus on the part about what the U.S. supreme court says about this, and see if you notice any cases where the supreme court upheld the right of the school to ban clothing even though it did not contain any explicit language. \n\n> The word fuck is not explicit. End of story. \n\nIt is well recognized that it is, and if the plaintiffs try to argue this to a court it will fail hard. Nice try though.So you like hot sauce on your ice cream?  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can say non-sequiturs too... but what's the point?Do you think it was justified that my teacher took my pink trenchcoat when I was 12 years old? Would you defend that?Banning books with bad words. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

That would be Barack Obama of course.

Lead is 46% to 38% among registered voters.\"  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>U.S. registered voters, by 46% to 38%, continue to say they are more likely to vote for the Republican presidential candidate than for Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election.   \n>  \n>The generic Republican led by the same eight-percentage-point margin in September, and also held a lead in July.\" [https://news.gallup.com/poll/150116/generic-republican-continues-lead-obama-vote.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/150116/generic-republican-continues-lead-obama-vote.aspx)  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Yet despite those terrible polls, somehow we didn't have to suffer for four years under President Romney. So allow me to state the obvious -- candidates do not run against unnamed, generic opponents.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The presidential election is essentially a three-way choice -- you can either vote for the Democrat, vote for the Republican, or you can throw your vote away (not vote, vote for a spoiler, etc.) Once Republicans have an actual named nominee, voters will be faced with an incredibly stark choice between the incumbent president or his challenger, and that choice will be reflected in future polls.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>If Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee again, voters will have a choice between the incumbent president or the one-term loser that they already rejected four years ago (in favor of the current incumbent). That loser, I might add, has only become more blatantly despicable since the last election, with criminal indictments to boot.My point is simply that there is a long, long way to go before the 2024 election, and \"Biden vs. unnamed generic Republican\" polls are essentially predictors of nothing.What a dumb thing to get butt hurt about.White 'moderates' butthurt about not being put ahead of everyone else... again.Yeah... New Hampshire, which usually goes red and only has 4 electoral votes, is an issue.\n\n\nSlow news day?I live in New Hampshire.  Fuck the first-in-the-nation primary.  Take your circus somewhere else.The points you\u2019re making put it all in perspective. Bed wetting over pills vs generic candidates a year out are indicative of nothing.Dumb or not, it\u2019s a needless political problem Biden and the DNC made for themselves. It\u2019s a purple state with an all-blue delegation; DNC can\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t surrender it to the GOP.More like: Dems from a purple state with an all-blue delegation are worried about the effects of giving the GOP months of unanswered campaigning at NH voters. You don\u2019t even need to talk about bad will or being \u201cbutthurt\u201d (are you 10?) to see the problems with this. If NH senators go red, GOP would hold senate majority right now.\n\nAnd NH is going first, that\u2019s not really what this is about. It\u2019s concern at the idea that the DNC will punish NH voters over it.New Hampshire has only gone red once (bush in 2000) in the last 30 years, voting democratic in all other presidential elections. What are you talking about?We don't have a single Republican in Washington.It voted Democratic/Blue in 7 of the last 8 Presidential elections.  It's also worth 1 more Electoral vote than Vermont, which is an afterthought because they're always reliably Blue/Democratic.\n\nWhile New Hampshire has leaned Blue/Democratic in recent history it has been all over the place as far as its Governor, Senators, and Representatives.  And it's been a very close thing in a few of those Presidential elections.  If that trend goes back the other way, it could lose the Democrats a Senator or two.\n\nEven if you can't reconcile the move to push Southern states further up in the calendar they can at least make an effort and campaign on the things he has done for the people of the country in general and New Hampshire in particular.  I'm hoping the Biden campaign isn't as dismissive.It\u2019s a purple state with an all-blue delegation. And there were plausible of maps in 2016 and 2020 where NH\u2019s 4 electoral votes would have been decisive. \n\nDems are ignoring this issue and I don\u2019t see why.The cynic in me says the media does this intentionally to try to create a bandwagon effect.The argument of \"we get to vote first or we'll vote for fascists\" is more akin to a 4 year olds temper tantrum than a credible threat.No. No. No. NH DOESN\u2019T accurately represent the country and shouldn\u2019t be able to dictate the terms for an entire party regarding scheduling. Fuck that.Yup, they want a horse race not a cake walk.It\u2019s more like: if the DNC follows through with this, then the GOP are going to get free reign to have 10 times the political infrastructure the Dems do in NH and will be engaging with NH voters where Dems generally are not going to be. \n\nThat is a credible threat to the success of the party. That\u2019s without getting into any bad will created by this.They want to push South Carolina up, which has about double the African American population as the country at large and less than a third of the Hispanic population.  It is also nowhere near accurately representing the country.Again, you can say \u201cno\u201d and deny it all you want but it\u2019s a real risk the DNC is taking here. Again, NH is a purple state with an all-blue delegation. GOP spent $64 million in *primary* ads there in 2016. Dems are leaving a vacuum that GOP will fill. \n\nAlso, DNC can\u2019t dictate terms to a state about when they set their primary. NH is going first. The state Republicans who would need to get on board with that change have already made that clear. Whether the DNC intends to punish NH voters over it (in addition to surrendering the state to GOP) is really up to them. They bluffed with MI and FL on this not too long ago. That may be the same outcome here. Which would make all of this a needless distraction.They want a Republican winner.>GOP are going to get free reign to have 10 times the political infrastructure the Dems do in NH  \n\nCitation needed. Hearsay is worthless.Except the black community has consistently been the backbone of the dem party especially during 2020 (see GA) and better represents diversity than NH.They want to push SC up because its the first state Biden actually won in '20 after placing 3rd or worse in the earlier primaries/caucuses.You\u2026.you need a citation for the premise that a robust Republican primary and an absent DNC is going to mean different levels of party infrastructure?\n\nWhat sort of source are you looking for? \n\nThe most recent contested primary for the GOP was in 2016. In 2016 in NH, the GOP spent [$64 million in ads alone](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2016/02/05/new-hampshire-primary-ad-spending/). Trump himself (not including the numerous other candidates) held 16 rallies in NH just during the primary. GOP held a primary debate in NH. I can\u2019t find a list of campaign offices and paid staffers in the state in NH primary, but it\u2019s a lot. \n\nFortunately, in 2016, the Dems also had a presence to get a different message to NH voters. The Dems spent about $34 million in ads themselves (see the above link). Hillary Clinton had 11 regional offices in NH and 3 get-out-the-vote centers. They also had a debate in NH. \n\nUnder the proposed calendar, NH votes on Super Tuesday. So let\u2019s see what Dem presence looked like in the Vermont primary, another small New England state that voted on ST in 2020. How much ad spending did Dems do in VT? No idea, too small to really track. How many campaign offices did the respective candidates set up? Again, can\u2019t give you a number, also too small for anyone to really track. Rallies? I think one across all candidates. Debates? None. \n\nYou are looking at GOP presence in NH akin to 2016 and a Dem presence in NH akin to Dems in VT in 2020. Looking at it, it\u2019s actually probably way worse than a party presence that is 1/10th what we see from the GOP. It\u2019s a serious threat to the party\u2019s success in NH.Lots of ways SC doesn\u2019t accurately represent the country. SC is disproportionately Christian (at a time when we have a Christian SCOTUS imposing their religious will). It is disproportionately evangelical (not exactly backbones of the Dem party). Disproportionally low numbers of Catholics, athiests, and Jewish people. And it\u2019s disproportionately Republican (also not backbones of the Dem party). \n\nPlenty of ways it isn\u2019t representative. If we are looking to boost the number of black voters specifically who vote early, there are better states (GA or NC to name a couple) than the obvious political kickback that is SC.>What source...  \n\nThe one that shows republican infrastructure in NH will be 10 times that of democrats.Sure but I\u2019d rather have SC than NH. GA would\u2019ve been preferred.Oh no, I think you\u2019ve got me there, I was probably wrong about the 10 times ratio (I used that as a general example). Digging into specific numbers, as you saw, makes me think it\u2019s probably way worse than 10 times.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*They can barely pass their own bill internally and are putting in so much effort even though it's 100% clear it's DOA in the Senate and won't be signed by the president.\n\nThey rubber stamped Trump's debt limit increases but won't do the same for Biden because they're duplicitous fucks, this is all brinkmanship and theater by a party incapable of governing.Let\u2019s say they get this bill passed today. Then what? The Senate won\u2019t sign on to it. Biden won\u2019t sign it. We\u2019re headed for disaster at this point.So if we don't meet all the demands of the Republicans, they will ruin our economy, destroy our credit rating, and basically fuck up 90% of the American population.\n\nWhen do we start calling this extortion?Kevin McCarthy is such a sloppy and weak Speaker of the House. He\u2019s no Nancy Pelosi.Huh?\n\nGOP \u201cleadership\u201d? \nI know of a theory about GOP leadership but it\u2019s in the same category as perpetual motion and everlasting gobstoppers>Those tax credits were part of Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act, the climate, energy and health-care package that Republicans opposed last year.\n\n>Those tax credits were part of Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act, the climate, energy and health-care package that Republicans opposed last year.\n\nActually from the article, nobody proofread it.>\u201dGaetz said at least 8 no votes on the bill\u201d\n\nAbsolute blowout if true. Rs had 6 holdouts on Monday. If they have 8 now, McCarthy is going to look really stupid.This won't be the last time they blink.\n\nThey have no leverage at all.  None.Remember when they claimed the bill was final and that there woukd be no changes? Remember how there would be no last minute changes? Goes to show how weak of a speaker he really is when having such a hard time and not even able to keep to his word.The debt bill should say \u201cpay the debt.\u201d Any other words are garbage that shouldn\u2019t be there.The party of domestic terrorism in action. \"We'll keep our uneconomic gravy and axe yours.\"Does nobody proofread at the hill? TrashUpdated their extortion pamphlet.Biden needs to call their bluffCrash the economy over throwing poor people off health coverage.  The revised change makes that a year sooner.So - GOP stance is that the biofuels industry can get special tax breaks & subsidies paid for by our tax dollars, but disabled and extremely poor Americans need to work more for their subsistence TANF food money?  \nSo, corporations > people?Hello Fiscal Cliff.That\u2019s just what owning the libs looks like.Yeah If the only thing the Republicans agree on is hold the debt ceiling hostage we're fucked. I'd hope we have 4 Republicans that vote with the Dems for a clean bill but who knows anymore.There is literally 0 chance the GOP let\u2019s us default. This has been and will always be political theatre. Don\u2019t believe me? Well we know republicans only care about themselves right? Well crashing the economy to Great Depression levels would erase their own bank accounts. They will never let that happen. Stop worrying about this nonsense.It's economic domestic terrorism. And, BTW, we are still paying for the last time they did this nonsense under Obama's Presidency. You'd think that Dems would mention it once in a while.That\u2019s not true. I\u2019m sure he uses insider information to trade stocks and I\u2019m sure he despises progressive polices that would actually help people.Of course there's GOP leadership.    Ever hear about lemmings jumping off a cliff en masse?  Just look for the one that went first.was accidentally corrected from GOP leader-shit. A common problem.I think they're referring to Marjorie Taylor BaxterPathetic that a publication that wants to be taken seriously can't spend 30 minutes editing their articles.way too early to be reading the same shit twiceEven AI articles are better than this.Again **Time to bite the pillowThere is always room to make it worseIt follows the pattern perfectly. \n\n\"We have the votes. We aren't changing the bill/listening to holdout demands\"\n\n*They don't have the votes, so they change the bill/acquiesce*\n\n\"Now we have the votes!\"\n\n*They continue to have meetings instead of a vote. Members say they're still voting no.*\n\n**We are here^**\n\n\"We have the votes! For real this time! We're going to talk about how this really unified us, that it's how democracy should work, and celebrate even before it passes!\"\n\n*It doesn't pass*\n\n*Radio silence from leadership.*\n\nI will always think back fondly on the schadenfreude of the penultimate speaker vote. A textbook example of why you shouldn't count your chickens before they hatch.He pretty much has.  The only thing he's willing to negotiate on is future spending, as it should be.Their hope is everyone blames Democrats, Democrats needs to shout it from the rooftops who the rightful blame falls on.McCarthy would have to put that on the floor and then he\u2019d be out as speaker. No way that happens in my opinion.I want to say one of the conditions of McCarthy becoming speaker was a panel of crazies who had to sign off before bills could come to a vote.  Specifically, to prevent that very scenario from happening.But it wouldn\u2019t erase THEIR bank accounts because THEY would know it\u2019s coming and withdraw their money.  It would just hurt everyone else.listen here, ya little shit \n\n/sYeah, but, does he have his own winery, and, not one, but two, $12,000 freezers full of $75/pint gourmet chocolate ice cream?Did you know the \u201clemmings jump off cliffs\u201d thing is a myth? Propagated by none other than the Walt Disney Company in their 1958 film [White Wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Wilderness_(film)?wprov=sfti1)? I just think it\u2019s interesting.I\u2019d rather go after the fuckface standing next to the cliff telling everyone to follow the lemming they pushed.Since when has The Hill been taken seriously? It's always been a rag.They probably just copied it from an AI bot in the first place.> that wants to be taken seriously \n\nThe Hill? Not much danger of that.Probably written by ChatGPT, but made to look like a sloppy human did it.Says the pathetic leech that wants perfect news for free with no ads. How many journalistic subscriptions do you pay for?15 ROUNDS BABYIt\u2019s so frustrating. It happens every time they hold the house. The American public mostly doesn\u2019t even understand what the debt limit is. It\u2019s all so so so infuriatingThey have been.  Who is listening is the bigger question.\n\nEdit - Biden just needs to print the trillion dollar coin and we good.  He should do it too.  No party should be able to hold the government ransom and attempt to hurt already vulnerable citizens.I think he might be out as speaker if he doesn't too.Sure but he also made it so a single member can recall him. Four Republicans not wanting their investments to be worth 0 might just do it.That\u2019s not how this works. It would make almost everything worthless.Yeah.  Probably.If we start playing the \u201cwho\u2019s more corrupt\u201d game we will be here a long time. They are both corrupt pieces of shit, Pelosi just happens to be associated with the party that occasionally moves us toward something marginally better. Neither actually care about the country.In a world where politicians make billions a year from corruption your bench mark is chocolate ice cream? Seems like you may have gotten caught up in the balance fallacy.That would be the grim reaper Moscow Mitch[removed]That could very well be, because those tax credits were part of Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act, the climate, energy and health-care package that Republicans opposed last year.News stories have been filled in by algorithms for a lot longer than the recent chatGPT shenanigans. Just usually you at least had one set of human eyes proof read it first before publishing.AI editor-bot approvedSuccessI have a NYT and WSJ subscription.  As the gatekeeper of who is a leech and who isn't, is that enough or should I double up before the end of the month?> The American public mostly doesn\u2019t even understand what the debt limit is. It\u2019s all so so so infuriating\n\nFrankly, the constituency shouldn't have to understand it, because the debt limit shouldn't even exist. To wit:\n\n> Many scholars argue that debt ceiling law is unconstitutional due to Section Four of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution, which states that \"the validity of the public debt of the United States...shall not be questioned.\" If this is true, then there is no legal basis for the United States government to default on its public debt even if its spending would exceed the limit set through debt ceiling law.\n\nIt's all bullshit political theater.Definitely possible, he has a razor thin majority and only one vote necessary to call to vacate the chair.They really do not want their investments to tank. Their billionaire donors won't be happy at all. Just send the whole economy into a tailspin to own the Libs? Just do it! Double dare them!It would make USD worthless, not all assets in the world\u2026.Not gold, which they'd invest heavily inLook at all the bills Pelosi's house passed that weren't even brought up in the republican controlled senate.It's not a benchmark, but more of an example of their ostentatious wealth and disdain they show for the plebs, and how out of touch they are with the rest of the country outside of DC and their gated compounds. Nancy Pelosi was mentioned which is why I used that example. If someone else was mentioned I would have used something different. These corrupt assh\\*les have certainly left no shortage of material.Bot commentIt's enough, but we don't appreciate that snarky attitude mister. As penance, you need to go and click on 100 ads on each site.I don't believe you at all lol. \n\nBut pretending for a minute, you must understand the challenges facing free publications in the era of ad blockers then? Reddit doesn't even click the link and expects the title to be a perfect summary, how do you propose the publisher pay someone to write and someone to proof read articles with 0 revenue?This is why I think Biden should sign an executive order declaring the debt limit unconstitutional and instructing treasury to just pay the damn bills. Then dare the republicans to sue him because it does what? Take away their ability to damage the economy? I don\u2019t doubt for a second that they\u2019d do it, or find a Texas judge to agree with them. \nBut that only makes Biden\u2019s case for re-election even stronger.I thought I read somewhere that most other countries don\u2019t have a debt ceilingWhy aren't democrats just calling for that vote every day? I know it won't pass, but it mucks everything up.A populist Republican party that doesn't care about corporations and the wealthy would be much more dangerous. If they really wanted to create a Gilead, they could. It would just take proposing nationalizing  a bunch of huge companies and redistributing money to their base.If USD fails so does much of the world. They will pass the debt ceiling just like every other time.By that logic only poor people should run for office? Seems like you\u2019re grasping at straws to prove \u201cthey\u2019re all bad\u201d when one side is blatantly destroying our country for personal gain and the other is eating chocolate ice cream. Again just because there are two sides doesn\u2019t mean those sides are equal.Not sure why I would like about something so petty, sounds like projection but here you go lol\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/a6O6EKT.png\n\nAlso the Hill brings in millions in revenue every year, not sure why you think it's zero...The US and Denmark are the only countries with a dollar limit debt ceiling. A few others, such as Poland, have a debt limit as a percentage of GDP. Basically every other country just automatically pays whatever budget their leadership approves.I sure hope so![removed]You said the Hill's article generated 0 revenue when in reality their articles generate millions in revenue every year.",

They\u2019re conditioning them to be less informed and less tolerant of reality which in turn will force them to stay where they are instead of leaving; which I\u2019m sure is the plan.Meanwhile, the Republican conservatives continue to point the fingers at liberal Democrats saying the Democrats are the ones indoctrinating our children's in schools.These people are cowards and religious zealots doing what religious zealots always do, indoctrinate children into their cult. \n\n^\n\n>North Dakota lawmakers have passed a bill forcing schools to blare anti-abortion propaganda videos at childrenHouse Bill 1265 orders school districts to show students a \u201chigh-definition ultrasound video, at least three minutes in duration, showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs, and other vital organs in early fetal development.\u201d The bill\u2019s text does not mention any concern for medical or scientific accuracy, nor principles related to bodily autonomy.\n\n\u2026\u2026\n\n>One of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, Senator Janne Myrdal, presented a sample video called \u201cBaby Olivia,\u201d made by anti-choice organization Live Action.\n\n\u2026.\n\n>The question of when \u201clife begins\u201d is a primary point of contention in the debate surrounding abortion rights; the video Myrdal presents, however, comes from an organization known for making heavily edited hoax videos to take down Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n>Fargo school board member and state director of Planned Parenthood Katie Christensen noted that the school board of the state\u2019s largest city opposed the bill. Christensen told TNR that experts came together to create the state\u2019s current health education content standards, and that the law \u201cdisregards the hard work and expertise of those individuals.\u201d\n\n\u2026..\n\n>Live Action hailed the bill\u2019s passage as \u201censuring all 116,639 students in North Dakota will be shown the truth,\u201d especially given that \u201cone of the options presented for school district use being Live Action\u2019s cutting-edge educational video Baby Olivia.\u201d Myrdal has said that Live Action is even willing to relinquish its rights to the video, taking its name off the video and providing it for free to the state.\n\n\u2026.\n\n>As can be seen with the litany of copycat bills nationwide antagonistic to abortion rights, labor, LGBTQ people, and more, it\u2019s possible that North Dakota will inspire other state legislatures as well. \u201cWith this bill\u2019s passage, it is possible that other states will follow suit,\u201d Live Action celebrated.The US' descent into theocratic hell hole is progressing faster than one would have thought possible...It\u2019s like the GOP has never heard of the internet. We are no longer in the 1960s where they can control the information people have access to.\n\n\u201cReligiously unaffiliated\u201d was flat for decades. Then suddenly, [something changed in the 1990s](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/pf_2022-09-13_religious-projections_01-01/). It\u2019s almost like these isolated little communities suddenly had access to the world\u2019s knowledge and could be exposed to new ideas. Wonder what it could be\u2026> House Bill 1265 orders school districts to show students a \u201chigh-definition ultrasound video, at least three minutes in duration, showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs, and other vital organs in early fetal development.\u201d The bill\u2019s text does not mention any concern for medical or scientific accuracy, nor principles related to bodily autonomy.\n\n> The bill also orders districts to show students \u201chigh-quality, computer-generated rendering or animation showing the process of fertilization and every stage of human development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy until birth.\u201d\n\nWould this technically allow the display of problematic evolutions that result in a necessary abortion?>\u201cCreator of the universe and all people therein, you who formed humankind in your image, placing them in this world in all their diversity\u2014differing colors, genders, races, ethnicities, and language.

But who has the resource to do that though?Oh look the party crying about \u201cindoctrinating children\u201d is..*checks notes\u2026indoctrinating children.Much like the DARE program, I can only assume this will lead to more abortions.>The bill also orders districts to show students \u201chigh-quality, computer-generated rendering or animation showing the process of fertilization and every stage of human development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy until birth.\u201d\n\nFinding out that it still basically looks like a sneeze in water at 6 weeks isn't exactly going to turn these kids into pro-lifers. It's almost like the guys writing these laws don't know shit about the fetal development process themselves...I really hate the argument about when does life begin. All cells are alive, sperm and egg even before they meet are alive. The question is when does a fertilized egg become a being with the rights we afford others and I\u2019d argue it\u2019s at birth. No other being has the ability to use someone else\u2019s body to keep them alive, why do afford that right to fetuses?\n\nIf you\u2019re against abortion, don\u2019t get one, but don\u2019t dictate what others can and can\u2019t do with their bodies.Republicans need to be removed from power at all costs.Parents should be able to opt out their kids, since this is allowed for sex ed classes.Now that's what I call \"grooming\"!>made by anti-choice organization Live Action\n\nThat says it all.Wild how half the country is working to turn the US into Saudi Arabia.So they\u2019re too young to learn about gay people, safe sex, and periods, but old enough to carry a child after being raped and marry their rapist, be told lies about abortion meant to fear monger and misinform, and devote their education to a religion they and their family may not even follow. Kk.Hand maid's tale in realityNorth Gilead.The intelligence level seems to lower drastically when you spend your whole life huffing farmland pesticides.Some days their party wants to ban sexual education in schools, other days they want to force kids to watch ultrasounds of a fetus....So does this mean that the Right leaning states are headed into the direction of the Handmaid Tale? Since when is any of this behavior Christian based?North Dakota: \"We're so pro-life that we want an influx of thousands of unwanted babies each year whose existence will pummel the already strained public welfare programs and foster families to the point of social and economic ruin all so that my version of God, but mainly my fellow thick-headed dipshit conservative politicians across the country, will love and adore me for being so reckless and fearless in the face of logic and reason.\"There is nothing in ND - absolutely NOTHING - that you can't get in a different state and have a better life experience. They are basically lebotomizing their children to retain relevance.The GOP has realized that they have exactly zero chance in ever attracting a meaningful cohort of millennials or gen Z. They thought with age millennials would become more conservative like congenital wisdom says but that just isn\u2019t happening for a number of reasons. Their only chance for any long term viability as a party is to indoctrinate children. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so focused on school. They know that if they don\u2019t get the next generation to be conservative early, there won\u2019t be enough boomers around in about 15 years for them to have any meaningful power.\u201cOk kids, we are going to watch this video about something you aren\u2019t supposed to do. Again, you cannot do these things, so don\u2019t get any ideas ok!?\u201d\n\nThat always works well with teenagersOMG!  STOP with all of this craziness! School is NOT church - if gender cannot be discussed in any measure in schools, books are being banned, wtf are you doing discussing or requiring one sided study of abortion. If it\u2019s going to be required, then statistics, pregnancy issues, how REAL women\u2019s lives are affected, must also be presented.  I call BS!!!GroomersAbsolute indoctrination by the GOP, supporters of \u201csmall government\u201d.   This is outrageous.But it's the Republicans who constantly complain about liberal indoctrination...Gotta start grooming those kids for republicans as early as possible. If you stick to the facts, you\u2019ll lose them to democrats.So now the government is the parents huh?  The GOP is so rediculous.I bet on the other hand they're against sex education, so the kids will be forced to watch this propaganda video while wondering how anyone gets pregnant in the first place.With internet readily available (cell phone usage), we're, for better or worse (cough election conspiracies cough), in a new age of information. Young people aren't going to fall for dumb shit like this. It's why young people, bless them, are turning out in droves and massively against establishment candidates and the GOP. \n\nMake shitty policies and do nothing to stop the massacre of their peers in school, a supposedly safe space, and you wonder why they're not voting for you??That's wild. I remember when my [CCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confraternity_of_Christian_Doctrine) ran similar programs in the 90s and even they were extremely low key about it. I specifically remember them bringing in someone who'd (supposedly) had and regretted having an abortion to tell us about the experience (in excruciating detail ...) and making us all promise that we wouldn't tell anyone that it'd happened.That\u2019s what they want. They want anyone not Republican to leave so they can keep their antiquated electoral college advantage.Lol I mean the gaslighting and hypocrisy is at is finest. \n\nThis isnt a buzzword. This is theocracy and fascism at work. Its funny how far right minded people will complain that having options is fascism, as their solution is giving...no options, and claiming it's freedom. \n\nWe are being run by people who are actively delusional and that is terrifyingHow do you both teach about abortion and ban sex education? Where do the babies that need saving come from?\n\nDo they teach immaculate conception? Storks?The state of the modern world disgusts meSounds like grooming to me.You guys do see what Republicans are doing, right\n\nThey're enacting brutal measures in certain states to drive blue voters out and ensure that while the country slowly gets bluer, those red states stay red. Though they will always be a marginal minority, they will have enough political influence to brickwall any meaningful legislation. \n\nThis is the schemeWhat is their stand on teaching Sex Ed and Birth Control.  Two things that are somewhat effective in preventing abortion ,when dealing with the hormonally excited youth.I would pull my kid out of school for shit like thisWatch how fast these very well connected teens bail out on the Republican Party and vote Dem for the next 50 years or so.  The Republicans are just screwing themselves over.  I feel badly for the women affected in the interim, but I\u2019m so glad the party of reactionary stupidity is hacking off the younger generation.  As a 61 year old white guy I\u2019m all in on the gutting of the Republican Party at this point.  I\u2019ve actively watched them for 45 years and have been progressively more concerned.  Donald Trump was the leap off the cliff\u2026 all the craziness came into the public view.  Now they\u2019re well and truly f*cked and I couldn\u2019t be happier.  We, as a country, just have to minimize the damage and fix it as quickly as possible. \n\nThe Dems aren\u2019t saints and have lots of problems which they\u2019ve had for years\u2026 thing is, they haven\u2019t jumped off a cliff like the GOP.  They have the same issues and I understand and can mitigate those.  God alone knows what the GOP will do next, but it will be hurtful and painful and target marginalized groups.  Wonderful people[deleted]really putting holes into their long held belief that the government is incapable of doing anything *its just what they're using it for that's horrible*Oh look indoctrination in public schools!Man these kids are going to grow up and go ape shitYou know what. Fuck this placeRepublicans: tHe C0nSt1TuT10n!  \nAlso: fuck all the ammendments not concerning gun lawsYeah and the dare program worked out so well. Stupid fucks.Dumb down the population little by littleGuys we really are just gonna ignore this like it\u2019s nothing?Freedom, this is nothing but freedom\u2026..right? \n\u2018Merica!! Wake up, this is what our ancestors fled from for Christ sake.Shit like this is why I dont really give a fuck about parents rights when measured against the rights of the children they want to keep ignorant.pretty soon democrats wont even need to promo themselves to Gen Z; GOP messaging will make their election choices for themI am once again imploring you to get your children, yourselves, and your money out of Gilead **while you still can.**Time for \u201creligious exemption\u201dThey are sowing the seeds of their own destruction.PsychoticGood job dummies.Since the right has shredded the separation of church and state it's time for the state to jump in on religion. The government will tell you what you worship, what rules you follow, and everyone will vote on what your beliefs are. Churches will be taxed by attendance and we will enforce every Biblical law as WE see fit. That's just the start of things... more to come...Who decides what\u2019s propaganda and what\u2019s the opposing point of view?showing what happens during a pregnancy is propaganda because it shows that abortion is killing a baby. Im sure showing a video of a 20 week abortion would be anti abortion propaganda too. https://youtu.be/A16gzm9eaa8?t=55I don\u2019t agree with abortion, but I agree with eradicating stupid people\u2019s kids\u2026\n\nSilver linings.lazy reporters. that image is a presentation on hydraulic fracturing. This is fake news.So showing students what happens in the womb is anti-abortion propaganda? Isn\u2019t this just something good to know about the body and how it forms?Indoctrination.Kids have phones.Too bad these dummies don't realize that nowadays with access to the internet by the time they are watching the propaganda, they've already formulated a pretty good idea on just about any of these topics or at least have been heavily influenced by their liberal leaning world.This state is getting worse and worse. I miss the Non-partisan League.And in other news: Adults continue to not understand how teenagers feel about being told they can\u2019t do things.Is it showing videos of an actual abortion ?!\nMaybe one has no right to not learn about it. Not many years ago ppl complained how wired it is, that you can show violence on TV to kids whilst sexual contents were censored. What changed ?\nEverybody should know how our meat is made, why not show an abortion ?The more you tell teens to not do something the more they are going to do it.  These idiots never learn.Is it propaganda if they\u2019ve been doing this in Catholic Schools for years? The abortion videos, the creepy lady bringing in the fetus dolls to pass around the class, wearing an \u201cI\u2019ll wait\u201d sticker for chastity day. It\u2019s only propaganda if it\u2019s in public schools I suppose \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fTeaching all students a belief held by a few.North Dakota this is like third world country trying to make it big with small ideas like propaganda on red meat issues, as if these political leaders actually represent people\u2019s values. Its all about keeping political power from the people so they can stay in power and they earn their fat salaries and build up their pensions so when they retire they have one big belly to snooze through life until they are laid to rest.Legendary.....So basically reinforce how women are nothing but incubators to them, and show it in such a fast and haphazard way that nobody could infer any logic of timescales and of when cellular clumps actually turn into what a rational person would consider a new humanTime to get up and walk outThis sounds like a job for the Santanic Temple.I\u2019m not following- I read the article, this is what the controversy is about?     \n\n_Students are shown a \u201chigh-quality, computer-generated rendering or animation showing the process of fertilization and every stage of human development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy until birth.\u201d_   \n\nI was shown this in my science class at high school in California years ago, and it had no bearing on my pro choice view.   Not showing biology, or science, seems like an awfully creepy stance that the right would be accused of taking\u2026 just sayin\u2019Who\u2019s grooming who? Personally, I don\u2019t think any form of Sex Ed should be taught by schools. Parents should know when it\u2019s time to have \u201cthe talk\u201d with their children. Don\u2019t let the government\u2019s culture war make the choice.Not that it's a good thing, but states like North Dakota are probably already at or close to their baseline simply due to such a small population spread out over a large geographic area with no major metropolitan areas or cultural centers to begin with.\n\nIn other words, the effects of brain drain are negligible on such rural areas because the collective brain power in fields like tech and law and medicine is permanently at step zero or baseline to begin with.Brain drain or not, they'll still get two senators for their population of 775k. While California with their 40 million also gets two. That's what they want, for you to leave the state for some non regressive one.They probably want this.\n\nIf ND becomes even more solidly red, then that's a guranteed 2 more red senators controlling America. (It would only take like 200,000 democratic voters to turn it blue - or one younger educated growing metropolitan area in the state)\n\nI think that's the main problem and why Florida is going so hard to the right, FL was a purple state, but it has shifted further red the last few times as people flee for safety.\n\nSame with Texas, if TX, FL become purple or blue states it's over for the republican party entirely (which is good, because then we would be able to split the democratic party into a Neoliberalism party and a further left Labor/socialist party- which is actually more representational to Americans beliefs and attitudes)It's an electoral strategy to lock the state down permanently red. \n\nThey -want- people to leave. Make it miserable so only the true believers will stay behind.If they can destroy 2/3rds of the states they can write a new Constitution, which will return to only allowing cis-het-white males that own property to vote.I was gonna make a joke about the divide creating two new human subspecies. But this is such bullshit, I\u2019d bet even the Morlocks would bail on North Dakota.That's what they want! Minority rule through tyrannical government overreach. If enough people leave these states, then they will have achieved their electoral goals. Not to mention the fact that in the senate, it's already the epitome of extreme minority rule already.That's what they want.Yeah but they still get 2 senators no matter what.Josh Hawley says he hopes that overturning Roe v Wade, as well as similar GOP legislation I assume, will make people move around the country which will strengthen the GOP nationally. I also assume this would mean the GOP hopes their legislation will also keep potential new GOP voters where they are... so yes.This is something I don\u2019t see being talked about enough. I know a few business owners who have said that getting an applicant from states doing things like this, book banning, not being allowed to talk about different lifestyles, etc., will already be a huge red flag and lower their chances of being seriously considered at all. Sure, their resume says they graduated from \u201cso and so\u201d school in ND or wherever, but did they really get a well rounded education there? Are they going to cause problems with anyone they don\u2019t agree with because they\u2019re being taught that if it doesn\u2019t conform to their beliefs than it\u2019s wrong? Why take that chance?\n\nAdmittedly i\u2019m in a very blue state and these are small businesses in small towns so it would be rare to get anyone applying from red states. But I have to imagine it\u2019s a growing concern for a lot of places.\n\nIt really sucks because there are so many incredible kids out there that could really help change the world for the better, but they likely won\u2019t ever reach their full potential because of the narrow minded people in charge of where they live.I was raised under the same \"never have sex\", \"women that get pregnant need to be punished\", \"gay people don't deserve to exist\", \"Black people are all lazy and criminals\" mentality was a Reagan worshipping Ayd Rand reading Evangelical Christian when I entered the workforce.\n\nWithin 6 months of meeting a wide variety of people I quickly started discarding it all because it was really obvious I had been lied to and the flamboyant gay man I had to work with was quite fun and seemed really nice.\n\nThe abortion thing took a little longer because that propaganda is HARSH, it creates a deep-seeded idea that you are against abortion for good reasons... which 99% is lies and the other 1% is not explaining reality to people.  \n\nThe biggest thing that Conservatism (and extreme Leftism, to be fair... but they hold zero power in the US) is to view the world as black and white, there are known right answers and obvious evil.  \n\nThat world view falls apart pretty quickly when you meet real people and talk to them, which in a work environment not talking to your co-workers or internal customers is not really an option.It\u2019s the case of the distraction & deception.\u201cDemocrats can\u2019t indoctrinate the children if we indoctrinate them first.\u201d Conservatives\"Every accusation is a confession.\"\n\nPeople tend to believe that others think/feel the way that they do. Thieves accuse others of stealing, perverts accuse others of perversion, and groomers accuse everyone of grooming.\n\nIt's an extremely predictable postulate when applied to conservatives.Well, in a sense, we are, to them.  But to them, facts and actual reality is indoctrination.  To them, their opinion is the only truth, the only way, and the reality of the situation is the indoctrination.  These people are seriously that deluded to think this to their core.[removed]What ultimately got me banned from the conservative sub was pointing out that the reason religion is dying, and engagement negatively correlated with youth and intelligence, is because people see it for the indoctrination that it is.\n\nThe 'marketing' for the church is god awful and it's no surprise smart and young people are turned off by it. The alleged payoff is a personal relationship with god which could take who knows how much is sacrificed to get there. No one wants to walk on the property, let alone in the door, to bother because on the outside looking in it's super toxic.\n\nBut they'd rather double down on how religion should lead legislation until people on the outside don't have a voice.That video is trash. I also don't see how a digitally created video is the same as a \"high definition ultrasound\". These people are clueless and are purely agenda-driven.Religious zealots, absolutely, but how are they cowards?This is what the Texas GOP were for doing at last year's convention.\n\nJune 18, 2022 [Requiring Texas students \u201cto learn about the humanity of the preborn child,\u201d including teaching that life begins at fertilization and requiring students to listen to live ultrasounds of gestating fetuses.](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/18/republican-party-texas-convention-cornyn/)\n\nIt went further than that. They want to teach children that a fetus has full human rights (but not the kids).Back in 1940 Heinlein figured we'd be in a theocracy starting in 2012.. with another 50 years or so before the Second Revolution.Indeed, I sometimes think I've been thrown into a different timeline.The alternative is we continue to be frogs in boiling water, unable to recognize what\u2019s happening. Maybe it\u2019s a blessing in disguise that the wheels are coming off so quickly right now. It\u2019s scaring the shit out of \u2018normal\u2019 people which is what you need for them to actually stand up against the backslide.[deleted]The Eternal September has its upsides.And then the social media algorithms showed up to shove them back into their narrow-minded Conservative bubbles and shield them from any real information.And what fetal tissue actually looks like at 6 weeks?  You know, without eyelashes, cartoon beating hearts, or conversation bubbles?In case anyone didn't read the article, the religious passage was from a pastor's prayer that this anti-choice lawmaker literally turned her back on in protest because he dared talk about \"diversity\".I love this.\n\nWe all know exactly what you mean but what you wrote absolutely implies DARE lead to a rise in abortions.I grew up under some of the original propaganda... long before computer animations, but they just flat out lie.  They don't even try.\n\nThey show pictures of a 18 week fetus and just say it's a 6 week baby.  They focus on partial birth abortions and late stage abortions (< 1% of all abortions) and never mention that almost all of those are because the fetus is non-viable.  \n\nThey also avoid talking about rape/incest, and make it sound like the only way to get pregnant is if a woman magically makes a man have unprotected sex with her, and of course the man is not to blame... she tempted HIM, he was **forced to stray**.Oh they jazzed it up and don't show the reality of what it looks like. Their rendering vastly overstates what a fetus looks like at every stage, as you probably expect.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-lQOooYAs8Also, baby isn't woman's body.Is a unborn baby not a living human five minutes before being born?Liberals need to be removed from power at all costs.\"anti choice\" doesn't sound biased at all.Or when you kill unborn babies because responsibility is no fun.Student: \"But how does the sperm get to the egg?\"\nTeacher: \"We don't talk about that.\"The reason this is happening is because the myth that people become more conservative when they get older is just that, a myth. \n\nWhat happens is people develop a general set of principles and values early in life, and then hold onto them. Society then shifts around them, thus making them relatively more or less liberal/conservative. \n\nThe reason people aren't getting more conservative is because all of the hallmarks you need to be conservative (stable housing, relatively good education and status) has been in a constant state of decline for younger generations - and despite 30 years, millenials  (and soon to be Gen Z), have not seen their material conditions improve, and their now reaching midlife. \n\nIf you don't have anything good going for you in aggregate, what would you want to CONSERVE.Kid raises hand and asks, \"How are babies made\"\n\nTeacher responds, \"Sorry, we can't teach that.\"They told us every step of the way they weren\u2019t going any further, and they told us we\u2019re crazy for thinking so.\n\nWe were told republicans don\u2019t want to do anything except balance the budget. Anything else is just left wing propaganda.\n\nThen they said they absolutely don\u2019t want a culture war, they just want kids to not feel ashamed of their country. \n\nThen they said they absolutely did not mind transgender kids, they just want fairness in sports. \n\nThen they said they absolutely don\u2019t want to prevent students learning American history, they just want to prevent critical race theory. \n\nThen they told us they absolutely don\u2019t want to prevent students from learning African American history, it just can\u2019t can\u2019t be before the 1970s\n\nThen they told us they don\u2019t care if there\u2019s LGBT students, they just don\u2019t want pornography in the books\n\nThen they told us they absolutely do not want to ban abortion, they just want to make sure they don\u2019t abort fetuses minuets before birth.\n\nThen they told us they absolutely do not want to take abortion from all 50 states, they just want voters to decide. \n\nThen they told us they don\u2019t care if there\u2019s LGBT high schoolers, they want to protect the elementary school students from grooming.\n\n\nWe\u2019re well passed all these steps. They gaslit us all the way down, and they\u2019ll still tell us they just want a \u201cbalanced budget\u201d. And they\u2019ll still tell us \u201cgaslighting\u201d is just a buzzword.It\u2019s sick\u2026God forbid they don't try to prevent the killing of babies.Exactly[deleted]Maybe one day you will get to experience the pain and suffering you wish to impose on others.  Maybe you will be at the bedside of a beloved family member who had previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and you will get to watch the doctors say \u201cYour condition has to worsen before we can treat you\u201d.  Maybe your loved one will get septic, have to be put on a ventilator, fight for her life in the ICU, or lose her uterus, because she was denied an abortion.  \n\nWill you enjoy it?  Will you relish in your anti-abortion victory?\n\nOr will you disavow yourself from all responsibility and lay it at the feet of \u201cgod\u2019s will\u201d - knowing full well you would ignore \u201cgod\u2019s will\u201d yourself and seek healthcare if you suddenly experienced crushing chest pain.  Why is women\u2019s medical care relegated to prayer while you get timely intervention?And why do you think people get abortions at or after 20 weeks? Let me tell you. Because we can't do an anatomy scan before 18-20 weeks. There are genetic conditions that would be incompatible with life or give a person severe deformities that we can't detect before said anatomy scan. It's literally the purpose of the scan to ensure the developing fetus has all the correct parts. \n\nAbortions at or after 20 weeks account for just over 1% of all abortions. (Hmm, great way to focus on the fringe cases.) These fetuses can have conditions that include, but are not limited to the following: not having a fully developed brain and being unable to ever breathe on their own; their organs growing into the placenta that has grown too far into the uterus and thus requires a hysterectomy; a fetus with its spine growing outside its body; a fetus with a hole in its back and exposed nerves that we can't correct.\n\nYes, these conditions are rare. By themselves they don't add up to much. But together they add up to that just over 1%. It's devastating to be halfway through pregnancy and told your fetus will never live a full life, it may never mature into a baby, and if birthed, will maybe live a few hours, suffering and in agony until it dies. And that ignores what could happen to the mother. One of these fetuses' head was full of fluid and way bigger than it should have been. The mother's uterus could rupture from the sheer size, but she's not allowed an abortion because the fetus has a heartbeat and the mother isn't dying **right now**.\n\n**No one, no one** should ever have that forced on them. **Ever**.YupTheir past productions were fabrications or exaggerations into the realm of absurdity.\n\n>The question of when \u201clife begins\u201d is a primary point of contention in the debate surrounding abortion rights; the video Myrdal presents, however, comes from an organization known for making heavily edited hoax videos to take down Planned Parenthood.So kids don't need to know about periods or sexuality, but they need to know about abortions? Right.Yup.Everywhere needs doctors though, and that\u2019s exactly who is being pushed out by the GOPs assault on healthcare. Several hospitals in Idaho have already had to stop being available for births and prenatal care because they don\u2019t have the staff. Red states already have significantly worse life expectancy and maternal mortality rates, that trend is just going to accelerate.I grew up in a conservative small town decades ago. I left as did my fellow nerd peers. I think you're correct- people may leave with a louder \"fuck all y'all\" (which these places deserve). But it's pretty much the same outcome as when I left.The US' descent into theocratic hell hole is progressing faster than one would have thought possible...I won\u2019t disagree with that beyond what another commenter said about doctors and such leaving. That being said our goal should really be fixing the underlying problems in these areas which push the residents to be extreme in the first place. The vast majority of those underlying problems are economic related. And here\u2019s the real problem with constant brain drain keeping those areas at a baseline - how do you improve the economic situation if there\u2019s no reason for business to go there? Resource extraction could be an answer, and is in a lot of cases, but I think as a country we want to reduce our reliance on that. Without talented, trained/skilled people, how do you fix it? I don\u2019t know. \n\nWhy is that our problem? Because the folks left behind are still voters and we\u2019re getting reminded of that daily.>Not that it's a good thing, but states like North Dakota are probably already at or close to their baseline simply due to such a small population spread out over a large geographic area with no major metropolitan areas or cultural centers to begin with.\n\n\nmore and more tech jobs can be worked remotely, and rural areas can be a draw for remote workers due to the lower property values and taxesAhh someone that doesn\u2019t know North Dakota speaking like they do. Being no tech there like you say it\u2019s weird the governor was created a tech company in Fargo for small/medium businesses sold it to Microsoft and was a president there for years after. \n\nWhile the state can suck ie look at this article you are the reason why people back home vote Republican time after time they hate people like you. \n\nKeep ignoring middle America instead of fighting to make it better see where that gets you.North Dakotan here\u2014it\u2019s been solidly red from the start. Giving the GOP more guaranteed seats is part of the reason there are two Dakotas in the first place.This is the key problem with the American political system - you could have democrats as 80% of the population concentrated in 15 states, and the remaining 35 states depopulated GOP wastelands...and those GOP wastelands would hold a super-majority in the Senate, also giving them complete control of the makeup of the Supreme Court among other powers.If it walks like a purge and talks like a purge\u2026\nThis is shooting themselves in the foot.>They -want- people to leave.\n\nThey *think* they want people to leave. A complete lack of an educated populous will be the death of them.  Guess who's doing most of the leaving?I've pointed out before if everyone moves out of red states, even if the population of red states went down to almost 0, they'd still have the same districs and number of representatives until 2030.r/uncapthehouseMy college degree from Florida is losing value every time Desantis speaks. With the way Florida\u2019s colleges are headed, if you can\u2019t get out of Florida to get an education because you can\u2019t afford out of state tuition and get a Florida degree it\u2019ll be worthless in any other state making it harder to leave.Why take the chance? \n\nBecause they have the opportunity to save people who are lgbt and/or able to be pregnant who are desperate to get somewhere safe.Then the best that one could hope for is the those politicians in those states to retire.Which is why you see such a push among the very religious to allow them to home school and have child marriages.  They don't want their kids exposed to outside ideas, ever.  \n\nThe ideal for a lot of religious people is to ban abortion and make an arranged marriage to ensure that kids get knocked up early and can't leave for college or the \"big city\" - they are forced to stay in their small town, marry someone from their parent's church, have their kids, and repeat the cycle.And don't forget projection!They are cowards because they will never allow another perspective other than their own.  They will not provide undisputed scientific evidence or history as two examples,  as that would require an honest evaluation of their contradictory 'beliefs'. They are cowards.They know they have to hide the outside world as much as possible from people in order to keep them in line - it's an implicit admission that their their ideas lose out when exposed to reality and that they're afraid of losing their control.> \u201cI began to sense faintly that secrecy is the keystone of all tyranny. Not force, but secrecy \u2026 censorship. When any government, or any church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, \u2018This you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden to know,\u2019 the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man whose mind has been hoodwinked; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, a man whose mind is free. No, not the rack, not fission bombs, not anything \u2014 you can\u2019t conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him.\u201d \n\n> \u2014 Robert Heinlein, [*If This Goes On*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22If_This_Goes_On%E2%80%94%22)So we are actually behind scheduleIt has nothing to do with science.  Its based on an ideology dipped in religion.Is that a joke?Maybe cartoon bubbles that say please kill me now before I\u2019m born into an unsustainable wasteland and eaten by starving family due to the failure of society to hold government and corporations responsible while the still could.This is my take. The weekly animation will look like a blob for months. And the development of a heart, lungs, etc., will clearly show to be far later than the typical religious propaganda. As always, idealogical bullshit smacks into the wall known as science.Oof, this thing is just blatantly lying from the first images. Babies don\u2019t open their eyes in the womb, it takes days outside before that happens. But it won\u2019t feel as human if we don\u2019t see her eyes and she looks like a squat Winston Churchill, so they \u2018pretty her up\u2019. It gets worse from there.Did they ever? At the end that looks like a three to four money old baby, not a full term fetus.What?Read what I wrote, take a moment, comprehend it, and you\u2019ll have your answerWell, Republicans can\u2019t win elections anymore because they\u2019re that vile so now they\u2019re resorting to stealing power. \n\nAnd that\u2019s why they need to be stopped at all cost.You mean the ones actually trying to enact things that will reduce the abortion rate like comprehensive sex ed and contraception for teenagers? Those are the only two things that are proven to reduce abortions, but Republicans won't even consider them because they just have to punish people for having sex.How many have you adopted?  \n\nOh. Zero? \n\nImagine that.I like you.[removed]I understand that. But if this video shows the basics of what happens in the womb, without any religious references (which is already by law not allowed in public schools). Then what does the \u201cwhen life begins\u201d point have to do with any of this and why does the personal beliefs / outside actions of the teacher matter? Would it have been this big of an issue if planned parenthood made the same exact video? See how this article is kinda off balance for to what their saying?The video is about what happens in the womb. What are you even talking about? I literally said it\u2019s probably good to know how the body is formed.The bad thing is they'll blame the liberals in blue states for their situation, too.It sounds like Darwinism at this point.Good?Those hospitals have to pay out absurd amounts of money to lure in doctors because nobody wants to live there.> fixing the underlying problems in these areas\n\nThat would be church, fox news/talk radio, and radicalization through social media.Why exactly should I respect people that want to destroy my family's quality of life?Look what you made me do.What do you mean by \"Being no tech there like you say it\u2019s weird the governor was created a tech company\"?Don't they need to fight for themselves?\n\nNote: I know they already are, but it seems odd to say we need to fight for it. What do you mean by that?rural america is only ignored as far as campaigning and messaging goes. but many of the policies that dems support benefits them too, medicaid, medicare, food stamps, social security, unemployment benefits, vocational rehabilitation, child day care, etc. \n\nproblem is that rural voters willingly cut off their nose to spite their face. there is no getting around that. they vote to punish a fictional enemy and vote to attack a nonexistent problem first and foremost.  \n\ni'm convinced that even if democrats tried to directly appeal to rural americans, it wouldn't change much until the majority of baby boomers in rural america are dead. as they are the largest demographic shaping the culture out here. and their children and grand children leave those areas. \n\nit will take time, but there are plenty of people who are leaving suburbs and cities to rural areas. it is a steady trickle, but given time its these folks who i suspect will be the motive change in rural america.Republicans hate, and that's ALL they have going for them.\n\nThe rest of the Country ignores middle America *because* of its hateful ideologies. The rest of the Country has zero desire to step back into 1776. They have zero desire to remove Constitutional Rights from American Citizens. They have zero desire to entertain those who willfully remove themselves from reality.\n\nThe same cannot be said of \"middle America\" and its Republican values.Hi there! I actually went to school there for a bit myself and have family there.\n\nIt is a solid red state, but it wouldn't take much growth in Grand Forks or Fargo to turn the State blue.\n\nHowever, as they have been passing increasingly hostile policies (and voting restriction laws - mostly targeting students and Native Communities), more and more young people are either leaving or choosing not to move there in the first place.\n\nND grew at a slower rate than MN by far, has a greater percent of aging population, and had a shrinking 'prime working age' population as a percentage of demographic makeup.\n\nIf ND made some investments into state infrastructure and planning, it could easily change that and become a growing and economically strong state. \n\nBut that would be things like collecting income taxes to increase their budget, using that budget to facilitate internet access development, helping farmers move away from mono crop field management with traditional pesticides to more diverse crop production and even alternative land uses, -like flood plains- slowing and limiting urban sprawl to make urban areas more pedestrian friendly -as this would also lower obesity rates and other comorbidities from lack of exercise. \n\nCreating a land tax system that maintains or lowers taxes for smaller family farms, creates a state based lending system for farmers that want to create infrastructure for co-ops, and increases it on those mega farms that buy up and then run other farmers out of business by purposely selling at a loss to bankrupt other farmers in the area.\n\nBut all of these things would encourage more domestic migration to the state, and even encourage young people who shift demographically to the left, to enter rural counties where maybe only 500 people currently live, potentially turning entire rural counties blueThey only need to ensure voting for a few more cycles. Then they can legislate away democracy entirely and hold power for themselves without worrying about voting, just have the electors be unelected and determined by the state legislatures.\n\nThey played their hand too early. The fascism we are seeing right now is a power-hungry monster expressing fear as it is backed into a corner.And they'd always have two senators, even if the population was one person.And their senators will become even crazier and polarizing. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that they had Clair McCaskill. Now they have Hawley. It only gets worse from here.Just say that you moved out before the Florida Brain Worm epidemic. People will understand.My masters degree from North Dakota is going to become so embarrassing that I'm gonna have to hide my framed diploma.That is a very good point. I hope more people consider that perspective. Honestly I\u2019m ashamed that I didn\u2019t even think about it that way.That\u2019s a great point. Thanks for sharing.That's the one.\n\n\nThere's a line in there about 'Take sex away from people' that comes to mind pretty often as well.\n\n\nReally illustrates how 'knowing something' and 'being able to prevent something' are two very different things.Yep.\n\n\nMuch like Sinclair Lewis's _It Can't Happen Here_ it was predicated on a Father Coughlin-type figure.. so imagine if Joel Osteen openly ran for office.[deleted]\u201cUnsustainable Wasteland\u201d\u2026that\u2019s on their license plates, I think.There is enough developing that they\u2019ll find a way to highlight. Fingernails come fairly nearly, as does a heart. But what matters is the brain, and the ability to feel pain, which comes very late in development. Not that they won\u2019t lie about that. I had classes in eighth grade that scarred me, showing photos of aborted babies covered in chemical burns, describing how the babies are in agony for days, how sometimes they\u2019re born alive and have to be euthanized. All lies, of course. Took me going to uni years later before I googled the truth for myself.Except the school boards will insist on biologically inaccurate materials.Read what you said in your last sentence above.What makes a born baby have more rights than an unborn baby?[deleted]>Would it have been this big of an issue if planned parenthood made the same exact video? \n\nIndeed it would have.  Teaching about the human body and how it works isn't the purview of planned parenthood or this dodgy production company or a legislature that has torpedoed basic rights from anyone not like them.\n\nThe point being, teaching about how the body works is up to a science teacher, not a freaking wannabe Taliban govt body.  Heaven forbid teaching critical thinking skills might be included.Did you see the video? Their 38 month gestation looks like a three to four month old baby.No?\n\nThere are good people trapped in places being destroyed by conservatives. They don't deserve it.No. Not good. Isolated and neglected, regardless of who did it, isn't good at all.No, not good. Healthcare is a human right, and this is the same sort of logic as \"Well if they didn't want to be in medical debt, did they try not being poor?\"Big cities like Houston could probably afford to do that, but many small towns can\u2019t and they\u2019ll just have to close up shop> That would be church\n\nAlthough I do want to clarify some of the apocalyptic thinking that perpetuates this. I could go into a *lot* more detail about all the apocalyptic thinking that permeates Christian nationalism, similarly to the one article that revealed all the apocalyptic references Daesh was making. But one detail is that fundamentalists are wary of fake Christians who will try to lead people astray in the end times. So while liberal denominations can and very much do push back against Christian nationalism, it's not necessarily going to help deradicalize anyone, because they'll just argue that we're those fake Christians and that it's a sign of the apocalypseI appreciate your clarification! I agree with all your points too. \n\nEspecially hilarious that Burgum is trying to lure more tech workers here, but also signs bills like the recent abortion ban which is only going to stifle that very potential growth. A+, Doug /sI mean, technically, they'd need a population of 3. But in reality, I'm sure a politician wouldn't let a little thing like state residency get in their way.Wouldn't it at least have to be a population of 2? Haha.Exactly. As much as I want people to go somewhere they feel safe, we also need people to stay and fight this, or else we\u2019ll have majorly disproportionate represenatation in the senate.I was on a thread yesterday on the Chicago subreddit that was talking about food and suddenly there were multiple redditors talking about how they moved away from Indiana to Chicago for various reasons including  because they didn\u2019t feel safe as lgbt. (And because the food is so much better).\n\nEdit* There was so much food talk I got it wrong\u2026 the post *was*  about moving to Chicago because of LGBT hate elsewhere.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/12xpy31/lgbtq_residents_moving_to_illinois_from_states/Its possible I only thought of it because It\u2019s something I\u2019m living (have an lgbt kid in Texas). Thankfully we landed jobs in a blue state and will move soon. \n\nThe employer did do some tentative pre-interview calling asking if I would be culturally comfortable in that state, after I made it clear why we wanted to move states they extended the invite for an official interview. Seeing what you wrote helped me understand why they took that cautious approach, so now we\u2019re both a little more enlightened \u263a\ufe0f.You don't see the \"dogma\" when it is introduced into secular law?  The reason they hide the religion is they know it will be seen as religion.  They hide it by trying to \"science\" it up.  \n\nRemember Intelligent Design?  Well that was rebranded creationism.  What is \"conception being the start of life\"?  Its rebranded dogma.  The science of viable life is being branded as a lie.  \n\nSame approach.  Its the same way the war for slavery was rebranded as \"States Rights\" and racism is rebranded as \"Heritage\".Do you not understand what theocracy is?So GQP logic; gruesome irrelevant medical discussion and fabricated graphic photos = fine, but historically accurate and contextual racial discussion = bad.This still doesn\u2019t make sense, I never claimed the fetus was a woman\u2019s bodyThe capacity to survive with out the reliance of a sole individuals body.It's hh for sure, good eye. Make them afraid again.[removed]Good point. I guess it\u2019s just the over reach of this article that throws me iff. Like you said it should be from a science teacher if anything, and that should have been the end of the article.[deleted]They'd put a prison there and count the prisoners as citizens of that state/township/whateverThey'll pass a law that says \"the dude's horse counts\".\n\nIf there's one person in the state, they're probably running the legislature lol\"what others can and can't do with their bodies\". Keywords being their bodies.That makes no sense.[deleted]But that is the problem, the Legislature is dictating children must see content approved by them.  This Legislature is biased in the extreme.Not all of them.  There are plenty of Democrats that live there, just because they can't win elections doesn't mean they should be thrown to the wolves of the GOP.But not let them vote, of course! Because that would just be sillyWhat does that have to do with \u201calso, baby isn\u2019t woman\u2019s body?\u201d I never made that claim.Why? What\u2019s confusing to you?That's what it sounded like you were saying.A helpless, unborn baby has no rights and can be killed? Come on.[removed]Yes, correct. It has exactly the rights it\u2019s afforded to it by the person whose body it relies on to survive .Then what the hell are you saying?That sounds wrong bro.That the government doesn\u2019t have the right to tell any individual what they can and can\u2019t do with their body. It\u2019s pretty clearWhat sounds wrong is forcing people who don\u2019t want to be, or can\u2019t be, pregnant to continue to be pregnant. That\u2019s fucked up.But the baby, who gets killed during an abortion, isn't the woman's body. The government can step in to protect the rights of the unborn child.Some people who don\u2019t have to go through pregnancy or never have, will never understand what it\u2019s like to carry a fetus to term, how it affects the body and mind permanently, and that even if you just give the baby up for adoption, it\u2019s still traumatic. \n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s business except for a woman and her doctor. I\u2019ve almost died from being pregnant, and these jerk offs would believe that it was somehow a punishment for opening my legs and it was \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d. It\u2019s f\u2019d up that they\u2019d put a fetus over the life of a woman. \n\nI\u2019ve worked with pregnancy crisis services, and I\u2019ve seen a lot. The government and everyone else needs to stay out of women\u2019s health decisions.Not at the expense to the person whose body it needs to survive, the fetus doesn\u2019t get more rights than any living personThe fetus is a parasite. It's physically attached to the mother and leeches their resources. It is not autonomous, as are born people and it cannot interact with the world through its own accord.Exactly, how many stories have we heard since the Dobbs decision of women being forced to destroy their own health because the government isn\u2019t letting them remove non viable fetuses. It\u2019s disgusting.That doesn't mean that you should kill it.It doesn't mean it has a right to life.Sure it does. It's a human life.",

A normal, boring, centrist politician is greatly preferable to a criminal fascist, generally speaking.Too many special interests.  We need to force them to legislate a ban on anything other than small dollar donors.  Progressives do not take corporate money.  Better to vote for progressives.And that\u2019s exactly the goddamn fucking problem in the first place. Donors and lobbyists. We need to keep money out of politics. Enough with the donors, the lobbyists and the corruption. But I guess good old corporate lapdog Biden needs to keep his fucking masters happy.Yay for big money donors? I'm sure this will be good for labor.Like it or not, he needs it to battle his opponent.Big money coalesces around Biden? Shocking.America is a funny country you know. Its truly a tvshowLmfaoHe should go sit down he\u2019s 80\u201cNothing fundamentally will change\u201dKinda makes you wonder when \"Big Money Donors\" are the only people getting excited about a 2nd Biden term. What I hear from this is: President for Sale - great bang for your buck!The wealthy bribe neo-liberal before the election.He's anti labor. He sided with the railroad monopoly. We need a progressiveSo progressiveAnd Americans like myself who have NEVER had their viewpoints represented by POTUS\u2026again get a lesser of two evils choice. Dandy. Love all that corporate cash and lack of options in our \u201cdemocracy\u201dCan we stop with the old decrepit fucks in the Whitehouse please? Either side. Sick of this shit.Someone's tired of Trump and Co, the GOP and all their bullshit!Despite Biden\u2019s age, this should be a slam dunk against anybody who comes up against him. Republicans did the ultimate no no and touched the third rail of politics.They should\u2019ve never fucked around with abortion.Early voting has begunSad we don\u2019t have any good choices in the next election just like the last three\u2026Why is this reported like it is a good thing? What do megadonors have to do with the beliefs that Americans have?No more old people for presidentWhat would happen if _both_ major party Presidential candidates dropped dead shortly before the election? Because the chance of that seems to be non-zero.*Ridin with Biden* \u2764Hear me out\u2026 big money <literally anything> should not be able to lobby any government at all. Policies for the people, not the corporations and the elite.Imagine being 80 years old and people still think you can do your job. \n\n\nWhy the duck are these guys so damn old? Like even the greeters at Wal-Mart are 70 tops. \n\nYou really think they are waking up early and working 40+hr weeks? \n\nOr is the serum they give them really really good?Unfortunate they would select a pic where hes looking like Fire Marshall BillHe\u2019s fucking 81\u2026. What are we doing as a country?  Why can\u2019t we run a better candidate for once. All politics aside, can we not get someone to be president who is younger than the age to get social security.Assuming Biden wins... and then assuming the president after him is Republican as the cycle seems to go... then that means the next time we can realistically talk about raising the minimum wage will either be 2032 or 2036.Money follows winners and good ideas \u2026 true capitalism at work.[deleted]Williamson isn't beholden to BIg money donors. Her message is similar to Sanders' in 2016.\n\nIf you continue to support and vote for candidates of the 1% you'll continue to get a government for the 1%.\n\nThe definition of insanity is to continue to do the same thing and expect different results.\n\nBiden's plan to fight inflation is to increase unemployment by 10 Million. That's not just 10 million workers. That's 10 million people who support a household with dependents. The counter argument is that the Fed only has so many tools to address inflation, right? So what has Biden done to address corporate profiteering? Corporate gouging? Biden sided with the rail owner and made illegal for workers to strike. A few weeks later there's a toxic derailments in East Palestine and Biden and Buttigieg were noticably absent. \n\nGreedflation is the word on the lips of workers, of parents, of voters, but that Biden and the major news media refuse to hear. If forced to hear, they refuse to understand. When confronted with overwhelming evidence, they change the subject.\n\nYou gonna listen when Biden and the news try to spin those events as unrelated? You gonna pretend that worker safety isn't also safety for everyone else?\n\nBut trump, right? But the facists right? \n\nThe Biden's DOJ did what about Jan 6? The guy who killed a cop got seven years. Seven. There's people rotting in prison on lesser charges. The DOJ brought what charges against the people who instigated the coup? Where's the case against Hawley? Cruz? Those traitors gave speeches to the mob, to incite anger, to encourage them to murder our democracy. \n\nThe congress members who refused to certify election results? Where's the person who planted the bombs? Biden told the DOJ he didn't want his presidency to be about trump. That's where. \n\nBiden is a non-response to trump.\n\nBiden is a non-response to facism.\n\nWhere the minimum wage increase? \"The parliamentarian said 'no'\"? Where's the BBB? Not waiting for another opportunity; it was always just a carrot to get support for the corporate giveaway that was the infrastructure bill.\n\nDo your own research. Search for Marianne Williamson. Listen to her. See for yourself.Why don't we just switch to some hybrid of oligarchy and meritocracy officially and stop pretending to be a democratic republic? The media is already there: \"the guy getting the most money is OBVIOUSLY the best candidate\" seems to be their mantra.It\u2019s funny how the reddit drones are stoked about more corporate money in politicsGod he is just the worst.Too old to run again. Selfish decision.Make sure his Walker has fresh tennis ballsUnless the Republicans put Trump up, Biden is going to lose. He's done such a bad job for workers' rights that the only reason a lot of undecided voters would vote for him is if Trump is the person he's up against.Perfect time to get some interest in a 3rd or 4th party option. Bernie wouldn\u2019t take a dime from any corporation and was beating the hell out of Hillary. Give me any other option at this point-I really wish money wasn't in politics.Sigh.I really really hope this isn't going to be a RBG episode all over again. Because that's what have the GOP it's tilt and speed to where it's at. If this happens again and pushed voters right the country is fucked.Fucking just retire already!!! (Motioning to all the old fucks running for or in a political position)What a POS, I cannot believe people are backing this regimeSo, coca cola, Pepsi, and jp Morgan behind Biden? The American people would rather not be lolGood. Hopefully he can buy this election. Who cares if my savings have been depleted thanks to rampant inflation the last few years. Go BidenIs that Fire Marshall Bill?Huge money like $100k in a few daysIt seems to be in their best interest. If America has any hope of remaining as the lead world power in light of Chinas emergence, steady \u201cnormal\u201d leadership like Biden is the way forward. He\u2019s good for business and international trade.Yay? LolI'd love to hear a top tier debate between Him and Sanders.He\u2019s such a puppet you can almost see the hand up his ass making him talk. No wonder nothing gets done he\u2019s only a slightly better choice then the actual piece of crap he will be up againstBrains and smarts are finally important again and it\u2019s not with DJTrump stupidities and cry baby, sore loser, big money is going with because we just can\u2019t have the daily dumb tweets out of DJTrump\u2019s ass on everything that he shouldn\u2019t be minding his business on. Please no DJTrump a big supporter still of Putin and Xi two supporters of fascist values.That's exactly why I'm not voting for him. Anyone who takes corporate money is not worth my vote.I\u2019m a dem.. please Biden don\u2019t run again. Can we get someone to be head of our county who is mentally sound? The guy obviously has some kind of dementia waiting to set inI can\u2019t figure this one out\u2026. Is that top lip curled and we\u2019re seeing top teeth or is he biting his upper lip and those are on the bottom?Oh FFS, I think I might have seen this movie before!Rotting on the vine. Hundreds of millions of people and this is their best?It's a civil trial though. More excited about the possible criminal case in Georgia and the DOJBiden is in a good spot. He has lots of money but doesn't have to spend it on a primary. Meanwhile, Trump is blowing his money on an ad campaign going after another Republican that isn't even running while at the same time fighting multiple court cases.This one is estimated to cost $2 billion. \n\nI'm starting to think that there's way too much money in politics. /sAnd don't forget the Georgia Grand JuryAnd potentially has to blow money on attack ads for his own primaryUnfortunately the orange one will get as much free media presence as he wants as simply as farting on a microphone.  He can dominate the news cycle whenever he chooses, and his cult loves everything he does regardless of what it is, so its pretty much free advertising and engagement.\n\nI'm going to assume any competitors of his will get the same benefit, except constant attacks by trump as well if he loses.The Republican nominee is everything he describes immigrants to be.Does he even need the war chest? Austerity!Biden needs a rapist on the opposition to win. Most Dems don't want him to run again. Big money donors who like the taxes how they are and union busting love their Biden.And will probably hoard the money for himselfJoke's on us, their base is into that.Oh, I'm sure they'll be giving money to Congressional GOP members too. Big money cares about money.And yet for big money, a criminal fascist is greatly preferable to anyone even remotely economically progressive. It will be interesting to see how people change their tune when that match up inevitably comes.Need to repeal Citizens United through congressional action, but that won\u2019t happen for a long time.Not going to happen so in the meantime, vote for Biden in 2024.Hell, we can't even get the Democratic party to reign in dark money organizations in its primaries, forcing them to pass some kind of campaign finance regulation is exactly what we need but it's going to be a long uphill battle when the better of the two parties is still a dumpster fire of corruptionI'll tell you what. Biden is basically the most boring candidate I've ever seen in my entire life, and I am not young.\n\nBut he has also turned out to be the most progressive president that has ever been in office. And that's pretty good. He has been a much better president than I thought he would be. All I needed was for him to be better than Trump. Which is a very low bar. But he turned out to be better than Obama too. And better than Clinton. Literally the best Democratic president I think we've ever had.  \n\nPerfect, but nobody's ever going to be perfect. Perfect candidates don't get the job.No *true* progressive...While we have the concept of capital, much less utilize it as the primary function of our society, you will never get money out of politics.\n\nIf the same thing I can use to buy a Bugatti is the same thing I use to pay rent and is the same thing I can give to anyone else for any reason... I'm going to get someone to give me money for a Bugatti in exchange for a vote. There's no way you can limit that.[removed]Look \ud83d\udc40! Big money put Trump in office!Could also just mean they really don\u2019t like the alternative.*Citizens United* will never be repealed if we impose limits on ourselves. You want to ban money in politics, you first have to use money to win.Still doesn't make it ethical or something that should be within our government. Yet this attitude helps normalize it.No he doesn't. He could try the small donation model if he gave a damn about standing up to corporate interests. I'd rather pay what I can than pretend that this corporate money is anything but a naked bribe.It's the most important election of our lifetime! (/s maybe)Biden has done a good job and the other sides a trannical backstabing mess. \n\nRich have 2 options sit back for this cycle or promote the clear better party for continued stability(profit)\n\nPeter thiel already says hes just sitting this one out. Many others will help biden for the benefits later on.*\"Nothing will fundamentally change for you if you [rich donors] pay more in taxes\"\n\nFTFY[removed]\u201cWe don\u2019t want the everythin burning to the ground\u201d is also a pretty good incentiveYep. For people to think big money is good for us are\u2026well they remind of clueless Trump voters.If one appears in the primary, I'll vote for them.  But if it's Biden, it's BidenAnd everyone on here is pumped about it. Keep feeding the government money! The rest of us will figure out rent in a few years. LolIt\u2019s a scam. No one wants Joe Biden.It's got nothing to do with Trump. The big donors have had Biden's back for 40+ years now and he's had theirs.Luckily the information is disclosedWe'd have Harris vs MTG presidential election.I feel this. It's so frustrating that everyone complains about the old white man running the country, and then we keep the Whitehouse as a hospice center every presidential term. It's so frustrating as a 28 year old drowning in this economy. Put someone in there that actually gives a fuck about people with a life ahead of them.\"Good ideas.\"Most people want stability, the wealthy more than most.  You have one side that tried a coupe and the other just gave us 4 years of boring old politics.    \n\nAs bad as not raising the debt ceiling would be, having members of congress executed on live TV would be even worse for the global economy.Not sure what's surprising about an article stating that wealthy Democratic donors are donating money to the Democratic candidate who is going to be the nominee.Williamson is a professional con artist and not a legitimate candidate in any way shape or form. I am all for alternatives to the big two but get real: she's running to sell books not to win and damn sure not to help peopleHe should win against DeSantis as well giving what's he's done to florida and the personality of a wet mop, combined with constant bullying from Trump if he loses and the disenfranchisement of cult members.\n\nI don't see an option for the GOP that, if not Trump, would have likely success either.  The primaries aren't very far away and they don't have time to turn MAGA folks onto a non-batshit gibbering crazy person.Worker's rights are not going to be magically repaired by the wave of a presidential wand - it's going to take time, work and discipline at an incredibly local level for any meaningful change.Wait until those people hear about how the Republican party wants to actively make workers rights even worse.Bernie's already endorsed Biden.> was beating the hell out of Hillary\n\nLosing by around 3M votes = beating the hell out of\"Regime\" lolBiden couldn't debate a 5th grader.It\u2019s a civil trial that has the ability to label him a rapist. For decades now people have only been able to say \u201caccused\u201d rapistThat is the one I want SO bad[removed]And the criminal case in NYC. If convicted, he'd legally be a convicted criminal fraudster.[removed]So we\u2019re just skipping the primaries now?Way too much FREE SPEECH you mean.Jack Smith still lurking out there, too.Yep, from politico in January of 2023, [\"Corporations gave $10M to election objectors after pledging to cut them off\"](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/06/corporations-election-objectors-donations-00076668)Having a competent leader shackled by a gerrymandered/filibustered Congress seems like the sweet spot for corporate interests.\n\nIt's just enough democratic agency to keep the lights on, but weak enough to stay away from fixing regressive tax schemes and any serious regulatory oversight.How does that work? Citizens united was overturning legislation as unconstitutionalSome general said \u201c you go to war with the army you have - not the one you want\u201d. I want a younger candidate but I am voting with the candidate we haveTHIS. Old lady who lives in rural America. I moved here in 2010 to grow veggies and have a few chickens. What I saw, most people here wouldn\u2019t believe. If these people worried about educating themselves and their children as much as they hate 1) The libs 2) Big coastal cities( you know the very places they are getting their generational government subsidies from) 3) POC and \u201cillegals\u201d 4) Non Christians 5) LGBTQ+ I can go on and on but I hope you get the picture, they would be unstoppable. Don\u2019t worry! The KKKlan and the Nazi Festivals keep them busy.  Would I like to see a few more progressives in office? Sure. Independents won\u2019t vote that way. And I hope the Democrats realize they will NEVER gain traction in some areas. The hatred is too strong. Failures have to blame their failures on someone. They have covered up their  40 year methamphetamine use, their living off of properties granny owned decades ago, and the astonishing crime rate that rivals  large cities per population, ( not recorded as many non incorporated) Sorry for rambling, but I was \u201ceducated\u201d in all this hate and detest what I see. We MUST not split votes and risk what we can\u2019t afford to risk. Trump used a black man becoming POTUS to garner support and it took us back decades.this is a primary not the general, why would you vote for someone who takes a bunch of corporate money vs someone who takes small dollar donations?Will Vote for any good primary opponents. Biden stacking the primary in his favor by putting SC first of course which has no bearing on winning.Pls no.? The republicans filibustered the dark money bill the house passed and every senate democrat voted for itI think you're right in that Biden is easily the best Democratic president we've had since LBJ, but I'd have to think about that comparison more before \"ever\".  And that's even before getting to FDR.Rights gained under Lyndon B. Johnson under the Voting Rights act of 1965 have *receded since President Biden has been in office.* Biden has not *even rhetorically argued for increasing medical access for Americans since coming into office the way that Lyndon B. Johnson argued his 4 years in office.* \n\nOne might argue, *its unfair to compare Johnson to Biden because Biden had more Democrats in Congress.* Firstly, the comparison starts when one calls Biden \"the most progressive President ever.\" The burden of proof then lies on the claimant. But secondly, while Johnson did not have to deal with as many Joe Manchins, he had to deal with many more **open white supremacists in his party**. \n\nBut most importantly, if we can't base it on the legislation the commander in chief, advocated for,  rhetorically argued for in office, and leveraged institutional knowledge to massage it thru congress, than what in the world are you basing this **massively subjective claim on?** \n\n**Lyndon B. Johnson had a far more progressive impact on the day to day lives of people in this country. For one, he finally executed the Civic Nation state ideal espoused by Lincoln by presiding over the era one person, one vote. Biden has presided over its decline. Johnson presided over a Social Democratic economy in which the Federal government had an active role in regulating industry and a significant social safety net to protect labor from the extremes of market failure. Biden's Bipartisan infrastructure bill that continues public-private partnerships, his recovery bill increased funding for COBRA, and he has taken virtually no steps to get the public option beyond committee in any congressional chamber. These are all hallmarks of maintaining a Laissez-faire Market driven economy. If there is any objective designation for \"most progressive President\", your claim is an anthesis of reality. Biden is more comparable to Teddy Roosevelt and doesn't begin to compare to Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson.**I know you\u2019re not young, because any young person who is trying to buy a home, pay hospital bills, pay for college, get a decent job, have any work-life balance, or save for retirement would have to be concussed to say the Biden administration is better than they ever expected.\n\nWhat am I supposed to be excited about, exactly? Infrastructure? Get real man. We got the status quo he promised.> But he turned out to be better than Obama too.\n\n\n\nExcept for the fact that Biden has not ended the unjust prosecution against Julian Assange that was rejected by the Obama administration but picked up under Trump.Ok, BernieBrother4Biden[removed][removed]Big money put Biden into office, instead of sanders\n\nWhat is your point?Yeah, I'm sure they'll right on that. Biden doesn't even pretend to want to overturn the trump era tax cuts, you think he has the slightest inclination to take down CU?Why the fuck are the rich involved in the first place? Politicians are supposed to be representatives of the people not the goddamn corporate elite. To hell with them.The rich always love to buy their personal policy. Bloomberg got what he paid for, as did the Waltons, and the heads of pharmaceutical companies, the tech sector, and those who own student loan debt\u2026 \n\nthe rich get what they paid for; Biden and his personal pledge to push their agendas.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2021/02/17/here-are-the-billionaires-who-donated-to-joe-bidens-2020-presidential-campaign/?sh=3c035c4121c4That\u2019s a problem. Their lives should fundamentally change.Currently holding my breath for rich people to be taxed more. We still have Trump\u2019s tax code\u2026Could have fixed this if people weren't so disenfranchised to vote because of deflating perspectives like thisTalk about ratfucking...Build back better was a con.\n\nMinimum wage increase was a con.\n\nBiden's history of civil rights activism was a con that forced Biden to drop out of past elections.\n\nLiberals pretending there's never an alternate to the corporate candidate is a con.\n\nBiden didn't beat trump. trump beat trump. There's only 43k votes in swing states between Biden and trump. The confidence in Biden's ability to win against DeSantis, Haley, or trump is a con.I heard it described that he has the personality equivalent of liminal space, which is the most accurate description of this man there is.I disagree. Especially with how he handled the railroad unions and the train crash in Chicago.  Combine that with decreasing military recruitment rate, which isn't his fault, but he's the president so he will take the blame in the voter's eyes, I don't see him winning unless he's up against somebody terrible.Yes, you're absolutely right.\n\n But when the president was in favor of union busting when he ran on a platform of Union supporting and when he worked in favor of the train company responsible for the wreck instead of the civilians who were hurt by the pollution it caused, that looks terrible and voters are going to remember that.Oh, I agree.  But that doesn't change what Biden has done. And if Republican candidate can make a compelling argument that he will do better, that will sway them.If people were fully rational armies would never rout. Running away in a panic puts you into more danger but people do it anyways across thousands of years of human history.\n\nFollowing that, we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to rally soldiers and prevent routs rather than assuming everyone will treat life like a math problem and always make the best choice.\n\nIf this is too veiled, will just come out and say, you're technically right but the results of \"yeah but the other side is worse\" have been very mixed electorally and should not be assumed to be a given with voters.Beating her in $amount.I mean when he admitted on the leaked video that he was \"grabbing them by the puss*\" right before the election in 2016, it didn't prevent people from electing him, so you have more faith than I that it will change anything other than they'll double down on their \"political prosecution\" claims.\n\nThe other cases have the possibility of sending him to prison and make it so he can never be president again.Or, more than likely end in a large settlement. The one public benefit will be it takes up his time and resources. We might also have evidence make it to the media. But hoping this case serves the public is similar to hoping Dominion would publicly prove Fox lied rather than quietly settle and take home $700 million. While I would love for the Claimant to help the public by using court to prove he is a rapist, it is also unfair to expect her to turn down a private settlement, given all she's personally been through.none of this `allegations` or `alleged`.\n\n`convicted rapist on the ballot`\n\nlets get there please.I know it's the reddit thing to do to equate being a billionaire with being evil no matter how they use the money, but Reid Hoffman is not a bad guy.Weird I\u2019ve seen so many new week old low karma accounts blasting Biden over this.  There\u2019s some valid criticism here, but smells like astroturfing controversy.He did not. He sided with Americans. \n\nI love how you guys literally never recognize that Biden sided with workers in every single other strike. But the railroad strike simply could not happen when we already had a supply chain crisis. Even a significant amount of the unions didn't want it. \n\nAnd workers got a lot of their demands met anyway, after the strike was cancelled, thanks in part to Biden and Democrats.\n\nEvery single Democrat voted to give workers the things they wanted. Republicans are the ones who stopped it.So what? It isn't going to affect the election one bit.I\u2019m not voting for Biden for this exact reasonNo, he didn't.And just who is going to go against him that stands a chance? Biden is more popular than anyone else, and has beaten Trump already. He has the middle, and they are what decides races these days.There are primaries but only two who\u2019ve announced runs against Biden are an anti-vaxxer who\u2019s just publicly praised Tucker Carlson and marrianne WilliamsonHere's how Bernie can still win.Yes lol.  That always happens when there is an incumbent.There will be primaries. Biden will spend $0 on them. And Biden will win.Most sitting presidents barely have a primary.Another example of why absolutism is bad. \n\nMoney really is speech in a lot of ways. If you have enough money, you can pay people to simply take over internet forums with your message, and even go to IRL events and create a completely fake \"grassroots movement\". \n\nWe should not allow society to be destroyed simply to protect the ability of billionaire Saudis to control speech in the US. Doing so is ironically hurting everyone else's free speech because it gets drowned out by the paid-for propaganda.That is the one with the most potential to destroy Trump. The potential charges are the most serious. Intentionally fucking with classified info is a big deal. Pence, Biden, and Hillary all did it basically by accident. But Trump literally refused to hand stuff over after it was found he had it. And if he passed it on to someone else, especially for money or favors, that's espionage.Corporations hedge their bets. If we end up under a fascist dictatorship, they want to ensure they are a favored company who will be allowed in on the grift.I\u2019ll just comment [this link](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/reform-law-needed-counter-citizens-united-hr-1) but there\u2019s a whole lot that is beyond my ability to explainNot to mention, it's hard to argue that Biden isn't the strongest candidate that Democrats can put forward. The incumbency advantage alone puts him ahead of others. \n\nWith how the GOP has become more and more craven, we can't afford to pull any punches.That quote was by Bush's Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld2028 will be interesting.I live in rural South Carolina and it is FUCKING TERRIFYING what society is like out here. Of course people are very polite and godly to your face but there is this huge religious movement that has just been co-opted by politics, basically turning Republicanism into a religion. And it's based mostly on hate for things they don't know anything about. You can add higher education to your list too. They absolutely loathe colleges and universities, claiming they are some satanic indoctrination meant to turn your children into sex perverts. \n\nThey ban together as a hivemind, and their entire belief system is based on disinformation. They've turned progressives who just want equal rights into monsters who want to turn their kids into sex slaves, solely based on what they read on idiot-tier social media and these free newspapers that are given out at those restaurants who have daily lunch specials for retirees.Who are you voting for that is primarying Biden\u2026Do you prefer pseudoscience healing crystal candidate, or antivaxxer candidate?Biden was not worried about winning his primary when they put SC first. \n\nNo one serious thinks the 2024 primary is anything other than a formality. The only way Biden wasn't going to be the nominee was if he didn't run.So you\u2019ll vote for who\u2026They're talking about in primaries. The DNC itself could just quit allowing it, it doesn't need to be a law to apply to primaries.That's a whole different thing which didn't do anything to prevent the Democratic party from reigning in dark money in its primaries, but [they still refused to do so](https://www.rawstory.com/once-again-dnc-panel-blocks-vote-on-dark-money-ban-in-democratic-primaries/). Wouldn't do anything to disadvantage the party in general election contests against Republicans, if anything it'd probably help voter have more trust in the party and turn out for us, but the donor class wants to keep tight control over who gets to be a Democratic party nominee, and the donor class gets what they want.Your analysis is leagues beyond the ability of this community to understand. Thanks for your efforts though.I really don't know what's confusing about it. I was expecting him to be pretty bland, and he has done better than I thought.\n\nNo president ever now or in the future is going to be exactly what you want. Everybody in this country has different priorities and if the job was easy we wouldn't need people to do it.\n\nAlso, I never said he's as progressive as I'd like him to be. He's just more progressive than I expected him to be.\n\nI'm really sorry that our country isn't a shit position right now. Things suck. He didn't make them suck. And no president ever could have fixed all those issues you just mentioned in 4 years. In fact, no president ever can fix all those issues in 8 years. They take time. I really hope we fix them. But putting that on one dude in the government whose job is supposed to be diplomatic is really weird.Lmao maybe the biggest climate bill in history? Or that he forgave 10-20k of student loansI feel like you might have missed the end of my comment. I want to clarify, literally no president ever in time is going to do everything you personally want them to do. There's millions of people in this country and your priorities are not the same as everyone else's.\n\nSay the judging an entire administration entirely on how they treat Julian assange seems like a weird way to judge an administration. Unless you are personally Julian assange in which case I guess it's your only priority.Exactly, I would know.You know damn well neither of these things will happen to TrumpNah, 51.6% of the popular vote to Bernie's 26.2% put Biden into office.Where did I say anything about Biden or the trump tax cuts in this specific comment?Because the conservatives on the Supreme Court legalized briberyBecause we chose very specifically capital C Capitalism.Believe it or not, the rich *are* people.You think the heads of pharmaceutical companies are happy Biden has forced them to [cap the cost of insulin at $35](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/politics/inflation-reduction-act-medicare-insulin-cap/index.html)?Now do the kochs or murdochAre you aware of the corporate minimum tax that is in effect starting this fiscal year?that will changeI agree, but apparently he also has regular temper tantrums with staffers over minor shit and is apparently absolutely disgusting to behold eating, so maybe a liminal space where appliances occasionally explode or the toiled backs upMilitary recruitment rate isnt really a concern to most of the left, at least from what ive heard.\n\nI disagree vehemently with his actions with the railroad unions, but put up against the batshit stuff coming out of the right at the moment its still no contestTo call the end of the rail strike \"union busting\" is really disingenuous. He had congress pass a resolution that was previously agreed upon by the union Brass, but not loved by the rank and file members.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect outcome - but it certainly wasn't anti-worker, either. Could it have been more pro-worker? Sure, but that also has to be weighed against the ongoing damage to an already fraught economy. What historical president could have and would have done better?\n\nWe really have to stop letting perfect be the enemy of good.Fair enough. I just feel like we haven't seen voters ever make this decision before. Not a significant number.And $ \u2260 votes. So I'm not sure what your point is here. He raised money, he couldn't convince enough people to vote for him. He lost. \n\nBiden will get plenty of small donations. He'll also get larger ones. This is not an issue other than for people looking for an angle to help Trump. \n\nSo, good luck with the whole 'Help Trump win' thing.Yeah but without a court conviction it allowed people like Cristie, Cruz, Graham, McConnell to ignore that. They may again, but it\u2019ll be much tougher to get the full establishment behind him. I also think it\u2019ll sway the like 2% of centerists that are somehow still \u201cundecided\u201d granted may sway them to DeSantis, which is away from Trump. And DeSantis will have a harder time against Biden then Trump. Granted you are right the Georgia grand jury will have more power in stopping trump than this civil case, I just didn\u2019t want its importance to be downgraded. It\u2019s significant in a historical sense that women will finally be able to see justice against one of the most powerful men in historyIt will peel off a few more independent voters. But the conservative base will simply pretend it's not real, blaming \"activist judges who just hate Trump for trying to drain the deep state swamp!\"The difference is the victim and accuser in this case is a human, not a corporate entity ; she may want retribution more than moneyTrump always settles, and part of the settlement is always that he has to admit no wrong doing and the settlement amount cannot be disclosed. He'll pay hundreds of millions of his followers' money to her to keep her quiet.And let\u2019s be honest. The current railway braking system was invented during the Civil War Ear. In Europe, the railway braking system was invented around 1920 and standardized in the 1950\u2019s. It\u2019s a failure on every president and congress between now and then for not making sure something like that  wasn\u2019t established already. Not just Biden. It can\u2019t always be the current party in power. Where were politicians for the past 70 years?I'm going to allow fascism to take over because I don't like Biden's tie. I simply cannot vote for someone who would wear that tie. So we'll just have to accept nationwide abortion bans and LGBTQ people being thrown in prison for violating the bible.Third party? No other option exists that didn't side with the railroads.If he was running for his first term as president he would lose the primaries but he's running for reelection and that is why he will be the nominee.\n\nIt has zip to do with popularity, or having already beaten trump, or having the middle especially given his current polling. \n\nHe's going to be the nominee because every last sitting president that has faced a serious primary challenger has meant that the party in control of the white house lost historically.\n\nNo one is going to risk that.Hopefully someone else joins the primaries.   \nI'm not looking forward to Kamala Harris being the next president.How about someone under 70? I don\u2019t want Kamala Harris to be defaulted the first woman president. She\u2019s awful.I\u2019m honestly surprised that there isn\u2019t a respectable challenger.Plus the Democrats had been neglecting to promote any new blood for decades while they were single-mindedly focused on getting Hillary Clinton into the White House. That's been remedied a bit in recent years, however many of the most promising new Democrats are still relatively inexperienced compared to what you'd expect for a Presidential candidate. They'll be in a much better position in 2028, though.Rumsfeld was evil but smart. He also said the thing about \"known unkowns\" which is one of the smartest things I've ever heard a politician say.Oh that\u2019s correct - such a sweet old guy\u2620\ufe0fThank you SO much for understanding. Hearing from other people who see this AND will speak up, well, appreciated more than you know!I think that\u2019s a rhetorical question. Has to be.Not sure yet but I\u2019m hoping the dems can find someone that\u2019s at least my grandparents age \ud83d\ude02 def not voting Biden again if Harris is the VP tho.For most borrowers, including me, forgiveness hasn\u2019t happened. I still owe what I did at the start of the pandemic. Biden\u2019s order is still held up in the courts. \n\nAnd the climate? Great dude. Did you know milk is $4.50 a gallon?Sorry that I care about journalistic freedom in uncovering war crimes.[removed]Joe Biden launched his campaign at an MNSBC executives mansion, before turning around and making him an ambassador to Canada\n\nMSNBC carried Joe water in the primary, while running blackout/smear campaigns on progressivesYou see, Biden is not the second coming of Christ in any and all deeds and words and therefore is indistinguishable from Trumpy Donbut how can i blame democrats for that!? \ud83d\ude21When? When did we make this choice? When was capitalism ever on the ballot in this country or any other? bizarre misunderstanding of history in your commentThe rich have a disproportionate influence on the outcome of policy. Its the antithesis of one person one vote.He didn't force them to do anything, they did it voluntarily, because it isn't a price cap it's just a cap on the co-pay insured people pay, so the pharmaceutical companies are still getting their money out of insurance companies and the insurance companies will just nudge up their premiums or find a way to suck some more subsidies out of taxpayers\n\nMeanwhile, uninsured people (e.g. the most likely to be harmed by rationing their insulin because they're poor) haven't gotten anything from any of thisYes, with a wink and a nod\u2026 insulin has made record profits for years, big pharma knew the clock was running out on that. And the price is only capped at $35 for seniors\u2026 \n\nWhat has Biden done on Xtandi? The cancer drug created with tax-payer money? Oh that\u2019s right, nothing\u2026 $200k a year for something we paid to develop, but we need to make sure the health care companies and pharmaceutical companies get to continue their unfettered access to our money. \n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-10/xtandi-pricing-prostate-cancer-drug\n\nWe have more than double the cost per capita than any other nation in the world for health care and we get far worse health care and have tremendous levels of uninsured. Biden will make sure that continues as people continue to die for corporate profits.Medical device companies are not happy about the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act but Trump signed that one. It was approved by veto-proof majority so no, he does not get any credit for signing it.Probably not but the hundreds of billions they made during covid is a nice ointment for that burn.I\u2019d prefer not to. They fuck the rest of us enough as it is.are you aware that does nothing to directly address the huge tax cuts trump made for the wealthiest americans?Lol. Call me when that happens\u201cWe really have to stop letting the perfect be the enemy of the good\u201d was y\u2019all\u2019s defense of Joe Biden in a pandemic, when he refused to back Medicare for all\n\nNow that the most union president to ever exist started busting their strikes, you have moved those goalpostsThe DNC helped to convince people not to vote for him. Had they backed him, he would have swept.> he couldn't convince enough people to vote for him. \n\nHe couldn\u2019t convince enough superdelegates to vote for him.That's fair but she's also paying lawyers. They are closer to corporate entitities than they are human.Saudi Arabia will pay for himI think they mean preventing the railroad workers Union from striking.It wasn't the braking system that caused the derailment in Ohio.I'm just going to abstain if the choices are Trump and Biden. I'm in California, it doesn't really make a difference. I'll vote blue down ticket and not vote for president. This shit is stupid.[removed]I'd be fine with Harris as the next president. She has a very good voting record in Congress. She'd be a billion times better than anyone Republicans nominate.Then run someone under 70 and get a majority to vote for them.I do wonder if Biden will switch VP\u2019s. Kamala is not only unpopular as a candidate herself, but it feels to me like she\u2019s been mostly kept out of the news since gaining office. If I was running a campaign for an older candidate, I would want someone charismatic in the VP spot and Kamala isn\u2019t it.I was hoping Biden would use 2020-2024 to grow the younger crowd, and have one of them ready to take over. He might've thought the same even. Life just isn't that charitable.If I have to go to war, Donald Rumsfeld is one of the first people I want in charge.\n\nIf I am deciding whether or not to go to war, Donald Rumsfeld is one of the last people I am listening to.Indeed.So you\u2019ll be helping the GOP\u2026ok? Way to bite your nose to spite your face.It\u2019s just hilarious because for the last decade redditors have been claiming the president can forgive loans with a stroke of a pen and then he does it and A. You\u2019re still whining about him not helping with college and B. Turns out it might not be true \n\n> And the climate? Great dude. Did you know milk is $4.50 a gallon?\n\n\nThis is literally hilarious: yeah it\u2019s the difference of life and death for millions of people but I have to pay an extra buck for milk \ud83d\ude21Okay but since he's dark Brandon, what if he's the first coming of Dark Christ? The edgy alter ego.The Democrats largely ignored the political calculus of the federal judiciary for decades while during the same time span the Republicans were building multiple well funded institutions specifically designed to move the American legal establishment to the right.You think socialism would win if it was on the ballot?Many things can be true.You're right, the cost of treatment is too high regardless of method. I do think it is incredibly disingenuous to blame Biden for a drug that released in 2012 and was part of Medicare through 2019, when it had funding slashed during the previous presidency.\n\nShould action be done? Yes, but not by Biden directly. We have a government that should be regulating life-saving healthcare prices. I don't think the president alone should have the power to tell a company what to charge. That seems like a dangerous precedent.All they said was rich people being taxed more. I provided an example of increased, minimum taxes on the large corporations that use loopholes to pay zip. That's certainly more taxes on the rich. \n\nI agree however that the Trump tax cuts should have been repealed, and I don't understand why Biden has not done so.Do you not remember when we were one John McCain thumb away from millions of people having their health care unceremoniously dropped by republicans?! It wasn't very long ago.\n\nHere's a thought experiment:\n\nHow exactly does Medicare for all pass in the early stages of the 2020 presidency? Put Bernie in there if that makes it easier. And there's two major hurdles that you have to explain.\n\n1) How does it get past an *extremely* radically conservative Supreme Court??\n\n2) How does it not lead to a true 'Red Wave' in the 2022 midterms??\n\nLook, I'm a proud union member and proponent of Medicare for all - more so recently after seeing how much it covered for my father in his final days and how much of a burden it took off of us. But I'm also someone that exists in the real world, and I just don't see the population at large chomping at the bit for such a seismic change. That kind of change has to come from the ground up and has little to do with who the President is. Top down change is rarely good in the long run.> The DNC helped to convince people not to vote for him.\n\nNo, they didn't. \n\n>Had they backed him, he would have swept.\n\nAnd it's weird that in the very next sentence you wish that they had done what you accuse them of for the person you like.Hillary Clinton pledged delegates: 2,205\n\nBernie Sanders pledged delegates: 1,846\n\nHe couldn't convince enough people to vote for him.A vote for nobody does nothing. A would be non maga voter not voting helps Trump. Not a wise choice.I don\u2019t know why it has to be Biden. He\u2019s fucking old. His running mate and future replacement is a boot licking POS. All signs are pointing to trump as the republicans nominee and he\u2019s polling abysmally. There are probably thousands of people more suited to being president than Joe Biden.\n\nWhy do we have to keep doing this? Biden\u2019s a corpse, basically.So, I\u2019m kinda out of the loop as far as Kamala\u2019s ongoings. Would you be willing to take a min and briefly layout what makes her so inept or otherwise lackluster as VP?VPs are always like that. Cheney being the exception, but that's because Bush was just a corporate puppet and Cheney was his handler.Andy Beshear the governor of KY wouldn\u2019t be bad vp. Democrat governor in a red state and isn\u2019t really offensive.During the Biden administration, we have Newsome, Buttigieg, Whitmer and others making national headlines.\n\nWhitmer 2028!It\u2019s like some people don\u2019t think beyond their actions.I\u2019m saying: Voters care most about what affects them in the immediate term. If people can\u2019t afford their medical bills, rent, or groceries, then that\u2019s what they want a politician to address. Not wind farms, not Ukraine, not any other bullshit.\n\n> yeah it\u2019s the difference of life and death for millions of people but I have to pay an extra buck for milk \ud83d\ude21\n\nThe DNC\u2019s 2024 outreach strategy: Make fun of poor peopleSo we should give credit to Biden for \u201cslashing drug prices\u201d when all he did was help shore up corporate profits, but we shouldn\u2019t ask him to act to actually slash drug prices?The real world you exist in, has a vast majority of Americans supporting single payer lmao> enough people\n\nHe had the majority of \u201cpeople\u201d, just not the majority of the inner party superdelegates / the media coordinating with his campaign like the cheater / rapist-enabler Hillary Clinton.I'm sorry. Biden once fist bumped a Saudi guy. So I simply cannot vote for him. We'll just have to allow abortion to be banned nationwide, and LGBTQ people will be thrown in prison for violating the bible. Because I cannot in good faith vote for someone who does the right thing but doesn't say we should have a full socialist revolution.\n\nWe'll just have to accept fascist Republican rule because the alternative would be me voting for someone who only does like 99% of the things I want. I mean if you look at [talking point] from 40 years ago, Biden voted in a way that looks bad if you strip all context! I mean how could I support him despite that which is now the most important thing in the world and the only issue I base my vote on, just given the fact that the alternative to Biden is having democracy completely dismantled and Republicans allowed to fix the system so they keep permanent control and force us into a Christian Taliban type situation?\n\nIf the choice is Biden or being imprisoned in a Christian Nationalist dictatorship, I choose to do nothing! Then after the dictatorship, I'll blame Democrats for not stopping it!I understand where you're coming from, but I just can't bring myself to vote for either candidate when I don't believe in what they stand for. I'll continue to be active in local and state politics, and push for changes I believe in. Hopefully, in the future, we'll have better options for presidential candidates that represent our values better, but I have to draw a line somewhere!Because Biden already beat Trump once, and that was when Trump had the incumbent advantage. So Biden argues that he's the Dem most likely to beat Trump again.\n\nHe's got a point, and he's the incumbent President now, so there's a vanishingly small chance that another Dem could beat him in a primary challenge. \n\nDon't get me wrong; I would also like to see a President who's younger and more progressive, but we're just gonna have to wait until 2028 for there to be a real chance of that.> His running mate and future replacement is a boot licking POS. \n\nShe had the most progressive voting record in the Senate. More progressive than even Bernie's.then who else?Oh I\u2019m not very strongly sourced. I\u2019m not referring to what she has done as VP, but that in as an avid newsreader I feel like I haven\u2019t seen her name come up much since 2020. As far as popularity, she dropped out of the 2020 primaries before Minnesota primary (which maybe was the first? Not sure.). She had cash issues beforehand, so she either had problems getting big donor backing or popularity among smaller donors. And personally, I find her demeanor unappealing and her debate highlights felt to me rehearsed and inauthentic. \n\nMoot point either way, because she\u2019s on the 2024 ticket.She hasn't done much, but in fairness the VP as a position doesn't do much besides babysit and tie break in the senate 80% of the time.\n\nBut policy wise? Her takes are pretty damn crap. See her 2020 primary platform and resulting performance.Haven\u2019t read up on him too much but Jeffries seems promising too.Yeah if you\u2019re willing to condemn millions to death to save a buck then yeah I\u2019ll make fun of you, also you know what else is going to drive prices up? When droughts decimate the world\u2019s food sourcesI think there's a key difference. Biden calling for slashing drug prices does not equal him actually doing it. I personally don't credit him with it, but my opinion is one of over 200 million. Do Warren and Sanders get less credit than Biden when it was literally part of their election platform? Do any of the progressives actually trying to improve quality of life deserve less credit than centralist Biden?\n\nI would stress that your argument doesn't address that he lacks the power to do what you're asking. It also isn't reflective of his policy.\n\nHe isn't the best president to ever exist. He isn't the second coming of Jesus. He's an old fart who is doing a good enough job. I won't give him any more or less than that.\n\nHe shouldn't be responsible for the other two branches of government. The affordable healthcare crisis is clearly for Congress to act on. That's how it has been for the last hundred years.Ok then - again, how does it get implemented?\n\nYou act like the only reason we don't have single payer is that Biden didn't try hard enough. Can you show your work and give me one plausible scenario where he is able to implement it permanently?> He had the majority of \u201cpeople\u201d\n\nI'm not sure what this even means. Are you including non voters? Are you saying Hillary voters don't count as people? \n\nIn either case, she got more votes. That's why she won. Whatever you're attempting to say makes no sense and I'm not sure you're worth engaging more with.Exactly. I simply cannot bring myself to vote for a democrat who would keep pushing us slightly left instead of going 100% full throttle left. \n\nWe'll just have to accept fascist rule, because I cannot stomach someone who only stands for 99% of what I want. \n\nThe transgender people who have their children taken away from them, and the people who have their kids taken away because they supported their transitioning, will just have to understand.\n\nWomen will just have to deal with this when abortion is made illegal nationwide. \n\nI simply cannot in good faith vote for someone who is only mostly doing the right things. So we'll just have to say goodbye to things like abortion rights.Fair points. Still, I don\u2019t believe that incumbency is nearly as effective as it should be when the candidate is this far past the average life expectancy and is showing this many signs of decline. What good is incumbency if the population is collectively worried that he\u2019s going to die from old age??\n\nThere is a good chance that Biden doesn\u2019t make it through a second term. That would leave us with Harris. 2028 comes around and she\u2019s the incumbent with the advantage. She wins, we do the same thing 2032. When do we run more progressive candidates again? 2038?Well considering that the primary is essentially closed, we won't know which candidates are actually interested in running. I think Gavin Newsome or Gretchen Whitmer would be preferable to anyone in their 80s.Oh I see. Yeah, I feel like I\u2019m out of the loop on her in part because I just don\u2019t ever see her anywhere. I was beginning to wonder if *they* prefer to keep her quiet because she\u2019s an easy target for criticism. I watch Reddit news fairly religiously and don\u2019t recall seeing her name in a headline at all yet this year.Holy shit lmao, this is the argument you came up with? People worried about the cost of living want millions to die?\n\nHigh schoolers and college kids need to get the fuck off this website.Congress won\u2019t act on healthcare when the president is owned by corporate health care interests, and other corporate lobbyists. \n\nI don\u2019t see rampant corruption and crony capitalism as signs of \u201ca good job\u201d, so I guess that\u2019s where we disagree.\u201cYou act like the only reason we don\u2019t have single payer is that Biden didn\u2019t try hard enough\u201d\n\nWell, when the president magically drops all mention of it the second he didn\u2019t have to campaign on it anymore\u2026it makes your argument a little impotent> I'm not sure what this even means.\n\nNormal delegates are elected by voters whereas superdelegates are appointed undemocratically. \n\n> In either case, she got more votes.\n\nNo she didn\u2019t. \n\n> I'm not sure you're worth engaging more with.\n\nThat\u2019s how I feel about your shithole country.Oh, we're doing sarcasm now?   \n\n\nI'm super excited to see what happens politically when Joe Biden suddenly dies in office. I can't wait for Kamala Harris to be the incumbent and get the nomination in 2028. She's really going to push the country in the right direction. I wonder who her VP will be, probably someone really progressive.I haven't seen \"signs of decline\", and I watch every one of his speeches. \n\nI see deceptively edited videos meant to make it look like he's going senile, but when I watch those little 3 second clips with the context added it's always something like he was making a joke and they just cut out the parts that make it apparent.\n\nAnd FYI, Harris had the most progressive voting record in congress. More progressive than Bernie's.I'd like to think Harris isn't completely dumb enough to try and run in 28 after her terrible performance in the 2020 primaries. If she does? I think we'd see something like President Abbott inaugurated in January of 2029. \n\nSo hopefully instead she isn't that dumb and we instead see something more like Whitmer or Newsom. In 28.i don't think either of them should run, they should focus on their governorshipsI mean it\u2019s what you\u2019ve said and it\u2019s pretty obvious there\u2019s not much Biden could have done to ever win your vote\n\nYou said as a young person bidens done nothing to get excited for. I pointed out that he did the biggest climate bill of all time  and that\u2019s he\u2019s forgiven 10-20k in loans to directly point out how\u2019s he\u2019s helped young people. The future livability of the planet and help with your student loans\n\nYou responded by saying I don\u2019t care lmao . Originally your list of wants also mentioned good jobs and cheaper healthcare both of which he\u2019s taken action on, you also directly said you don\u2019t care about infrastructure (haha) so it\u2019s pretty rich to hear someone like that cry about high schoolers on Reddit when you pretty clearly don\u2019t know what you want or what the president can doI think we largely disagree on who is \"bought.\" Congress does not and has never answered directly to the president. They are an equal branch of government. I think your argument would make more sense if you were crusading to remove dark money from politics and overturn Citizens United.\n\nCrony capitalism? Rampant corruption? I am happy to give you the benefit of the doubt. Can you give any sources or examples of President Biden's crony capitalism or rampant corruption? I'm skeptical.Except that [he didn't ever campaign on it](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/biden-says-coronavirus-hasnt-changed-his-mind-on-single-payer.html). \n\nHow does alternate timeline President Bernie Sanders implement single payer?\n\nMy main point is that Presidents aren't Kings. Just because one thing happened that wasn't 100% worker friendly doesn't make Biden some far right autocrat.Not sure if lying or uninformed. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primariesOh please. He's healthy. Just old.I mean Kamala had a more progressive voting record in the Senate than anyone, including Bernie. \n\nWe could do a lot worse.Newsome has already served a single term as Governor, 2024 would be half way though his second. I'm his constituent, I wouldn't mind. I think having him as president would still serve my interests and open a seat on the CA Governor to a more progressive candidate. \n\nI'm getting tired of pretending that Biden isn't experiencing the beginning of mental decline. It doesn't take more than 10 seconds of looking to find some hard to watch moments of Joe Biden fading in and out of conversations and losing it for a moment. I'm afraid by the end of a second term it'll look like Weekend at Bernies. It isn't just his stutter- he's fucking old. \n\n Democrats shouldn't be taking this L, we don't need to-  Trump will likely be the nominee and he also will have zero chance, regardless of who democrats put up. I think democrats can afford to take a much bigger swing than someone like Joe Biden.\"Just old\" is a hugeee issue for the commander and chief for me. I know plenty of 80 year olds that I wouldn't trust to drive a fucking car.What does whining about it accomplish?",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*I find it strange that \u201ctough\u201d republicans are so afraid of a small minority.Missouri is basically a chain of three liberal population and revenue centers, Kansas City, Columbia, and St. Louis, being governed and extracted from by the rural, right-wing, Bible-waving bigots that have gerrymandered their way into state government.Cities should just be safe for everyone.Can't wait for Trump to call on the *Kansas state legislature* to stop this!The Library at UMKC is home to a huge special collection of LGBTQ materials known as the Gay & Lesbian Archive of Middle America ([GLAMA](https://libweb.umkc.edu/glama)).\"She said they are working to understand how much the city is legally allowed to do within the framework of the attorney general\u2019s guidelines.\n\nBecause Kansas City\u00a0does not have local control\u00a0of its police department, Bough said they have to be careful wording the resolution.\n\n\u201cWe can say to members of our community that we see you, we welcome you, and we will support you in every way that we can,\u201d Bough said. \u201cWe will not let those who seek to harm you come to our communities and step on our jurisdiction and impose their will on us to the highest extent of our capabilities and our laws.\u201d\"\n\n\n\nI wasn't aware any police department wouldn't be under local control.It's 2023 in America and we need a 'safe haven' for legally consenting trans adults to be able to be who they want to be. Wtf is going on?Good for them! I met my first openly trans person in KC back in the early 2000\u2019s I loved how unbigoted and accepting of the LGBT community KC was way back thenI love my city, I hate where it is.one of my brother's kids is LGBTQ and moved from Columbia MO to the KC area. luckily they're already over 21, but i asked my brother just yesterday how they've been affected by our jagoff AG. he said his kid and their partner were thinking about moving to MI. even though they're of age, i'm sure it makes them feel unwelcome in their home state.First I am horrified by the idea that in the US we need to do something like this.  With that said I draw some parallels to the \"Warsaw Ghetto\".I believe there's a Missouri town with a sheriff who refuses to cooperate with gun laws and agencies, which makes this rather interesting. Hard to create a legal argument that would affect KC for being a sanctuary city but not affect this other town.Sooo\u2026 this is about trans people, but it also relates to everyone else being able to wear whatever they want. \n\nAre pants/shorts considered a men\u2019s only clothing item? I know some conservatives that felt/feel that way, a friend of mine was forced to wear skirts and dresses her entire life until she became an adult. The emotional toll it took on her when she described what it was like- and as far as I\u2019m aware, she\u2019s cis. \n\nPeople should be able to feel comfortable and safe to be themselves, jeezus.>Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey issued emergency rules making it harder for both minors and adults to get gender-affirming care \n\nPretty clear proof there that this has nothing to do with women's sports or children's health care or any other good reason.\n\nThis law isn't being pushed by a doctor.  Not by someone who knows what they're talking about.  It's not even really being passed at all, this is just one random asshole pretending tonhave the divine right of kings.\n\nThis is clearly nothing more than bigotry for the sake of pandering to bigots.Missouri is such a shitty state that two of its major cities sit right on the border \"just in case\".Coming soon: fashion police. Maybe it\u2019s a joke, but actually it\u2019s not.Can we just acknowledge how badly Republican laws and judges are warping the law so badly that states can't function with their neighbor states, cities can't function within their own states, and otherwise completely reasonable, law abiding citizens cannot possibly obey the laws....Liberal bastion Kansas City.\n\nThat may be the first time those 4 words have been placed together.Missouri very unfortunately has a Republican governor. Would be awesome if mayors of blue cities in red states can tell the state governor to go fuck himself. One could argue that any city with a population greater than Wyoming should be granted a greater degree of local sovereignty like states.Manhattan, KS. about 2 hours away from KC, has regular Pride events. It's received with positivity for the most part. Still, you have the bible thumbers, but they're not causing as much of a fuss (At least not that I noticed).Safe haven or not. I wouldn\u2019t fucking go there. Like\u2026I wouldn\u2019t relocate to safe haven Berlin as the nazis came to power.It makes me happy seeing classically seen red states having very progressive people <3Bring back city-states.  The barbarian hinterlands think they deserve to call the shots in our current system.A vote for a Republican is a vote against freedom.Who gives a shit? Seriously, what have trans people done to deserve being treated like shit? Do I think it\u2019s strange? Yeah. Do I have any idea on how to relate to their personal identity? No. But these are my fellow Americans and we all do strange things because some of the strange things would be cause for prison or death in other countries. Just pay your taxes, wash your hands after you use whatever bathroom of your choice, and don\u2019t be shitty to others.I've seen more than a few \"Safe Space\" signs downtown which is good to see. I'm glad people are doing their partI am proud that Kansas City is standing up. Remember Hitler started by making people afraid of gay people and gypsies, and then moved on to people of color and Jews. Finally, you were only good if you were Aryan. DeSantis, Trump, and the rest of the racist right need to be stopped and Kansas City is stepping up to do their part. We should all do our part. The great America I want is one that accepts all people especially if they are on the fringes of society. The ones we should shun are the racistsJesus Christ, now we need \"safe havens\" for normal people whose \"crime\" is that they happen to be trans?They should just pass a bunch of civil bounty laws that make cooperating with those State laws, costly.Maybe Kansas City could just become a city state. Why should they be attached to Missouri anyway?Dang St. Louis pick up the slackKansas City is a cool place.  Best city in MIssouri, by far.Bleeding Kansas 2 Electric boogalooTrump got the ball rolling with that transgender military ban. And it hasn\u2019t stopped since.Ahem. Missouri AND Kansas laws. We need KC to do this, it would be amazing. Stick it to both sides of the Man.Good for them! It is time for intolerance to have no place to hide anymore.Let's go Missouri!Some laws require defiance.Finally a little good news from our cursed \u201cshow me\u201d stateI wonder how much difference there is between Kansas City, KS, and Kansas City, MO when it comes to this kind of initiative. All I know is that there are two, and that folks sometimes take pains to distinguish themselves from being one or the other.Who would have guessed that something like this might happen in a country founded by rebels?!Fuck yes. Blue islands unite! Viva density! Viva pluralism! Viva compassion! Viva Bill of Rights!Don\u2019t forget that they are terrified of any disruption to the conventional gender role hierarchy and model. Absolutely terrified.20% of the population is transgender. This is crazy!Republicans always out there about how the woke liberals are screwing with their way of life.\n\nMeanwhile, a gerrymandered legislature full of rural yokels are literally stopping people from transitioning (the *vast* majority of them who live in the city and nowhere near the saintly Real Americans\u2122).At this point, Missouri is committing self-harm. Healthy polities do not behave this way. Intervention is necessary.Please someone tell me if there is an actual safe haven place there in Missouri or nearby.Do it then. Don't just consider. Do it.So like the Netherlands and specifically Amsterdam in the 1930s were for European Jews?\n\nThat should work out well for everyone.\n\nWe should at least get some great literature out of it, for the conservatives to burn later.Due to our lack of control over our own police I don\u2019t know how much we can officially do. It\u2019s a nice sentiment though.Let people live their life normally. Republicans have no other agenda except to stoke fear. The culture war in America is insane.Most of the Ozark hillbillies are south of KCI don't really understand transgenderism, I don't get it, it seems bizarre to me.  It doesn't matter though.  Why?  Because its none of my fucking business.  People are free to live their lives the way that will make them happy.  As long as they aren't hurting themselves or anyone else, I don't see why anyone fucking cares what these people do with their lives to find personal happiness and contentment.  \n\nMost of these anti-trans people that I've seen and met come off seriously messed up to me.  They have a weird obsession with these people, often unhinged in their hatreds and easy to anger and enrage.  The are constantly screaming from the rooftops about their twisted ideology or religious cult bullshit demanding acceptance from everyone around them.  They seem weak, insecure, scared.  Its fucking weird.  Weirder than transgenderism thats for damn sure.  They've got issues.  Major ones, and perhaps they should get their hands out of other people's underwear and fix their own fucked up lives first.We\u2019ll see how this goes. Don\u2019t forget Kansas City booed a pregame [unity ceremony.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chiefs-texans-fans-booing-nfl-opener-moment-silence/)Man, now I really have to make sure I pick the right Kansas City.Blacks probably need the same thingNo point, or Constitutional Authority to restrict adults.\n\nInsane to fight against a law restricting that protects person who cannot consent.So all the trans people will go to Kansas City and be effectively locked in?Please no. Kansas City already has enough of a problem with police ignoring minorities when it comes to crime. Look at the woman who only survived her kidnapping because she was able to escape. This will just make it worse.If the Democratic Party wanted to win state legislature races, it should start buying up houses in red areas and renting it out to Dem voters from blue areas. We need a population dispersal to be competitive. With WFH this could be achieved.JesusEye roll[removed]Wait\u2026. Did Missouri pass a law that allows trans people to be attacked? It\u2019s a safe haven from what exactly?[removed]Everything\u2019s up to date in Kansas City!Go KC! Set the wave in motion!Well now I have a reason to like Kansas CotyMissouri, where we hate company.Awesome !!!Good for them. We are all human beings folks.WonderfulAs a Raider fan I hate Kansas City, I truly hope they do this and they will my respect as a city.  Still F the ChiefsPlease let this happenMy next vacation will be in KC.do it Kansas City! we support you, you are NOT alone!All right KCMO!Bell Street Mama\u2019s will always be a safe space in my heart.Lfg!!!!It's beautiful to see we can still have pockets of sanity in this country.Please don\u2019t downvote, as I am genuinely curious about this.  What does gender affirming care entail? The article mentions HRT but I didnt see other examples mentioned. Is it just all general healthcare for trans people? How does this differ from healthcare for a regular woman and trans woman outside of HRT? Seems absurd they would deny people access to some of these resourcesRecently I went to a friend's house, as he had some friends of his over and we were gonna have dinner and play games and such. One of the friends labeled himself as \"very far right\" and was a huge weapons aficionado.\n\nLater on, my friend told me that this guy seemed uncomfortable and nervous about a friend (i.e., me) coming over even though he normally didn't care. My friend figured out it was because I'm a noodle in Satan's alphabet soup and told him he had 30 seconds to adjust his attitude or fuck off. \n\nIt's hysterical to me that this big dude with more guns than sense is actually afraid of me. Like. I'm 5'3\", don't own any guns, have a pet rabbit, apologize to inanimate objects when I bump into them, and feel guilty picking the mean dialog options in video games. I don't see how needing to go through puberty a second time makes me such a threat.[removed]Anybody who spends a lot of their time projecting \u201ctoughness\u201d is usually a huge pussy.They attack trans because they want to attack gay people but can't. Trans people are an easy target. They are an unbelievably small and powerless minority and unlike gay people - which nearly everyone knows one gay person - not everyone knows a trans person so lies can be more easily told and believed about them. Attacking such a small minority is not going to cause mch blowback as a result and if they can get away with attacking trans people, they've paved the way for attacking gay people in general. Its a death by 1,000 cuts method.They aren't afraid of it.  It targeted on purpose.Well, they are '*secretly*' turned on by it and that upsets SkyDaddy... So that is the real issue at play.Easier to bully.We're not going all the way. It's just kissing.They(as in the rightwing leadership) need a boogyman and a common enemy to rally around otherwise their monster might turn on them.Small weenie and even smaller brain cells! Republicans..[removed]They have sons and daughters, and discord groomers are everywhere.  It's truly terrifying.It\u2019s so obviously a distraction from all their other criminal activities. In citizens 18-24\n.05% identify as transgender. In people 65 and over .03%. This is such blatant bigotry, how is it even possible? I guess it\u2019s just another fear-mongering attempt by the republicans.I think a lot of the mid-sized cities are more liberal than you would expect, too. Fifty miles north of KC, St. Joseph has had a Pride parade for years, and this year they\u2019re planning a Juneteenth celebration.\n\nEdit: I should probably point out that St. Joseph is also the home of a college, which certainly makes a difference.That's pretty much like every state. Even California gets super conservative in Central Valley, eastwards from the coast and then you have full blown militias in Shasta county.General Assembly term limits are also a factor, it sounds like a much better idea on paper than it actually is.  What people who support this idea think they're getting is a limit on how long crooked people can stay in power and lower incentive to \"play the political game\" to stay in power.  What you actually get is *more* corruption because when you know you can only stay in a legislative seat for no longer than 8 years no matter what you're not beholden to the voters once you get voted in in the first place, you're beholden to the lobbying groups and corporate boards who have nice, cushy jobs waiting for you after your term limit is up and are incentivized to do everything they say regardless of what the voters want.People seem to think this is unique to the US, but it's everywhere.\n\nYou know the \"liberal\" Netherlands, with weed capitol Amsterdam? The climate change denying racist lgbtq-phobic \"farmers party\" has just recently won the provincial elections. Because most of the country outside a few cities is a conservative shit hole. Same shit everywhere.Serious question: Is there a red state that that doesn\u2019t describe?This describes every state in the midwest/plains.Oh irony! \n\nFuture anthropologists will be studying the American political system and be completely baffled by it as the only example of such a system.\n\nInstead of hinterlands, these cities have hindleg lands.Sounds like FL, where college towns are decidedly blue, but the rest is bum fuck redColumbia is home to the flagship university (Mizzou) so I really wonder how that town is going to respond.Yes and no.  You\u2019d be surprised how many right wing boomers are hanging around St. Louis county trying to ram their lunatics into school district boards in small local elections.Texas is the same. DFW, Houston, San Antonio, Austin.This describes most US states.[removed]Cities are the safest places for minorities and anyone who is outside of average.Everywhere should just be safe for everyone.This is quality regional humor and I laughed.Kansas City, Kansas is already considering how they can make Kansas City, Missouri change their name because they're afraid they might get caught supporting trans folks by association.Incredible acronym for the subject matter.If I were them I'd be looking to see if I can move it to a different state for safekeeping until things settle down. Sad that it might come to that thoughGlama sounds like how I would pronounce glamour. I am gayIn the past, Kansas City was a mob town with really bad police and mafia corruption. \n\nSo the state took control of our police force. \n\nNow the state still has control and won\u2019t return local rule to us because they\u2019re republican nightmares. \n\nSo an action that is good *in its time* can become bad if allowed to outlive its purposeKC hasn\u2019t had control of its police for almost a century. Due to mob activity back in, I think the 20s? The state took control over our police. The very conservative state gov has constantly used it as political sway against the more liberal city in more recent years. We\u2019ve been fighting to get city control again but I think the whole state would have to vote on it. Which if true, will not happen any time soon.The state police thing is a pretty shitty situation. Bonus points for the fact that the police take up 25% of the city budget and are still asking for more money on this years budget. They happily take all of our tax money and we have no say in how they police usAmerica was founded by Calvinists and slave-owners.  That baggage passed down the generations to today.Its called christofacsism.Ironic how US tries to present a modern facade to the world only to utterly fail at it once someone decides to take a look at what really happens down there.My family is fleeing to a blue state this year. I hate this.>AmericaKC don\u2019t take no shit, been a lot of unapologetic counter culture in the city for a long while. Kansas City was founded on many things that were once seen as lewd and illegal but are now championed. It\u2019s been a haven for a long, long time.I'm driving into town today. What's a good BBQ spot to check out?Here in Wichita I join you in that displeasure.The AGs laws would unfortunately limit everyone, not just kids. It\u2019s adults too.My kid grew up \u201cgay adjacent\u201d in St Louis and had trans friends in high school. We\u2019ve left Missouri but I won\u2019t be surprised if one of my kids friends take their own life at some point.  Which will devastate my kid.  These policies affect more than just trans people - they affect everyone who knows and cares about them. I worked with a trans individual at my last job and they don\u2019t need this.\n  \nAnd the most depressing thing is that it\u2019s a sideshow. Nobody _actually _ gives a shit, but getting the base on both sides riled up arguing about trans people or drag queens sure does choke out discussion of wages, taxation, and ever-widening wealth disparity.St. Louisan here...I agreeThe head of the Texas Department of Agriculture issued a rule where employees have to dress in a \"gender appropriate\" manner.do you have examples?Kansas City has pretty much always been blue. Even some of the suburbs are too.\n\nSource: Live in KC.KC has been heavily purple-blue for sometime now. \n\n\nKC, STL, and Jeff City are the only reasons MO isn\u2019t more of a red-state shitholeKansas City has been gay-friendly for a lot longer than folks give it credit for.Not at all, KC proper is generally pretty progressive and reliably blue. That said the KS side of the metro area that has a huge portion of the population has been flipping to blue. KCMO and KCK are blue, Johnson County KS where a lot of the money is elected a gay Native woman to congress. \n\nKC proper does not reflect the backwards right wing politics of the state. If you ask a rural Missourian a good portion of them think KC is an actual commie war zone.Kansas City is changing quickly. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate in over 100 years to get more than 50% of the vote in Johnson County, KS which contains many of the Kansas City suburban communities. Not even FDR or LBJ accomplished that feat in their respective landslide elections.A clear example of how demographics are shiftingUnfortunately, every time the two urban centers have tried to buck Jeff City, the Republican super-majority has come back and passed a \"No municipality can pass a law that exceeds the state's law\" sort of thing. St Louis City tried to raise just their own minimum wage. Nope, can't do that. Tried to offer certain employment protections. Nope, can't do that.\n\nOn Medicaid expansion, one Republican rep (in office thanks to gerrymandering) who's district voted overwhelmingly for it actually stated \"I proudly stand *against the will of the people*\" when it came time to actually budget it. Our Supreme Court had to tell them they didn't have a choice.\n\nThat's what we're dealing with in MO.Yeah. I'm a native from KC and trans, and while I'll miss my home city, I have to leave. They've taken my hormones I've been on for a decade, and they won't stop until trans people are eradicated. \n\nI hope I feel safe enough to visit sooner rather than later, but I fear I may be staying away from Missouri for quite some time.That\u2019s not a bad ideaI think this is a brilliant idea, make it so that half of kansas city can't do buisness in the other half of the city because they are across the border. Do same thing for st louis so both stupid cities can implode on themselves.I'd even accept being adopted by daddy Kansas. \n\nIt would actually turn Kansas Blue. Win-win.Well, KC to be exact.Now let's not go that far.KC specifically. Most of MO is a shithole.\n\nI'm pretty pissed that STL hasn't done this yet.Most laws require defianceThis is the (legal) measuring twice part of the old adage \u2018Measure twice, cut once.\u2019And STL is most likely going to go back to state control. Just as the new Chief is starting to get some traction, despite our CA.There\u2019s no such thing as \u201ctransgenderism\u201dThe \"-ism\" applied to \"transgender\" falsely implies that being transgender is a choice, religious practice, or ideology, rather than an innate, deeply personal, and natural variation of the human experience.We are not a religion, we are a community, hence why we refer to ourselves as the transgender community, not transgenderism. Just like there is no gayism or lesbianismTransgenderism isn't a thing.\n\nStop using the rhetoric of genocidal bigots please.This is a healthy attitude.  It actually takes some guts to admit and say that first part openly, even.\n\nNever understood why \"I find X unattractive\" (or secretly attractive) is a huge deal.  But I think it's really just a mask for manufactured outrage, mass psychosis via media for political gain.Transgenderism is a dog whistle. Please just say trans peopleThat's because you think being trans is a choice im guessing? And you think that if you were trans you'd be transitioning to a woman, and that seems awful to you. But in reality you'd be transitioning to a man, because you are one. You haven't had to though because you're not trans. \n\nIts a medical condition you're born with.Imagine a football fan. Then imagine a midwestern football fan. *Then* imagine a midwestern football fan who would go to a game at the height of the pandemic.\n\nThere is your reason for that. KC has been blue a long time and has some very liberal orgs like KC Tenants.Don\u2019t use one minority group to shit on another.why do you make up things to be upset aboutThe state trying to control their bodies and identities.  So basically attacking their freedom to be who they want to be.Missouri's AG is the reason I can't get my HRT refilled after nearly a decade.Your comment is basically incomprehensible so I won't respond to all of it, but trans people are more likely to be assaulted than cisgender people. Just people generally don't care, while trans people performing assault feeds into the narrative that trans people are dangerous and gets amplified.\n\nHere's a reference to one study: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/\n\nHere's the Wikipedia article: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_transgender_people_in_the_United_StatesReally? Trans people are attacked and killed in high numbers just for being trans. They are 4x more likely to be attacked than cis gendered individuals.Your comment is filled with misinformation and harmful stereotypes about the transgender community. The language used is offensive and derogatory, and perpetuates harmful myths about transgender individuals being inherently violent.\n\nIn reality, transgender individuals are far more likely to experience violence and discrimination than to perpetrate it. Transgender people face high rates of harassment, assault, and murder simply for being who they are. It is wrong to suggest that all transgender people are violent or that they are responsible for attacks on cisgender individuals. \n\nAnd the idea that a \"normal person\" fighting with a transgender person is automatically a hate crime is incorrect. Hate crimes are determined by the motivation behind the attack, not the identities of the individuals involved. If a transgender person attacks a cisgender person because of their gender identity, that could be considered a hate crime. \n\nYour call to \"stand up to dictatorships\" and \"make our nation great again\" is concerning. Please recognize that the current administration is democratically elected, and that democracy depends on peaceful disagreement and debate, not violence or intimidation. The idea of \"make America great again\" is often used as a dog whistle for exclusionary and discriminatory policies that harm marginalized communities. Reject this kind of rhetoric, and work towards a more inclusive and equitable nation for all.Ok Trumpet, dictators do exactly this,  by trying to rewrite history, and oppress others.  Why it it anybody's business if someone else feels like they were born in the wrong body?  How you dress or what you do in your bedroom is none of anyone's business.   Why are the Republicans intent on banning everything?  Why can't they accept not everyone thinks the same?Go for the BBQ, you won't be disappointed.\n>>>It's hysterical to me that this big dude with more guns than sense is actually afraid of me. Like. I'm 5'3\", don't own any guns, have a pet rabbit, apologize to inanimate objects when I bump into them, and feel guilty picking the mean dialog options in video games. I don't see how needing to go through puberty a second time makes me such a threat.\n\nOh my god I am stealing this, can I steal this? It\u2019s so specifically my experience except a bird instead of a rabbit. Bless your friend for standing with you.Apologies, but what the hell does \u201ca noodle in Satan\u2019s alphabet soup\u201d mean?Your friend is one to hold onto, for sure!I wonder how that very far-right guy's relationship with any women in his life has turned out. Like legit projection, he probably is single or treats his partner like total shit. Thus why he's single.> A noodle in Satan's Alphabet Soup\n\nGod I need to steal this.\n\nMy work's LGBTQ+ slack channel is alphabet mafia but I may have to save \"Satan's Alphabet Soup\" for April Fool's next year :3He probably has a deep seated insecurity in his own sexuality.  There's no other reason I can think of.  It's hate based on fear.  \n\nAs a side note, off topic - I'm the same way in video games!  I have a really hard time playing as a jerk, even if I've already played through an entire game as the nicest guy in the world.  I just can't bring myself to be rude to fictional video game characters.Oh dear...Was the alphabet soup part said out loud? Cause he probably now thinks your an FBI accountant after his guns.In all fairness, some rabbits can be very intimidating.This is spot on, except for the fact that things didn\u2019t inherently \u201cshift\u201d from one group to the next - race, trans, gay, women, etc were all hated from the start. Conservatives just have slowly had to shift their focus as it became societally not okay to hate on certain groups (at least publicly).You\u2019re absolutely right, I\u2019m just so fatigued by people \u201cexplaining\u201d conservative / republican behavior. Basically, they\u2019re assholes and who cares why. They need to be defeated at the polls everywhere, and have their propaganda machine shut down permanently.> *Remember kids, \"aryans\" were not white until Hitler came around. \n\nPlease read (no in retrospect don't read), \"Essai sur l'inegalit\u00e9 des races\". A book made by a Frenchman where he tries to show how the Aryans built the first civilizations most of the time, but not all the time. He isn't even antisemite and acknowledge the Incas without really being able to explain how they developped. For him Indians have been civilized by Egyptians. But what's important is that it introduced the concept in Germany (despite being written in French) and once mixed with German pan nationalism became the idea that Aryans are nordic people and that they create nations. There is a book in German around 1890 that is very important for that subject but I forgot the title. It's upon that base that Nazi racial gibberish was built on.Gays aren't off the hook.  America didn't suddenly have a come to Jesus moment about gay people.  The rights that gay people have today didn't come from the American public accepting them, it came from lawsuits.  The courts had to force it.  The majority of states still have anti-gay laws on their books that they can't enforce.  America was perfectly happy oppressing and segregating gay people until the court told them to stop.  And there is still plenty of anti-gay hatred spewed their way.  You just don't hear it as much in the news anymore and the amount of it has declined but its still very much there and I can say this from experience.  America is not the land of the free, never was, never will be.  This country will always find someone to hate because people love nothing better than to feel superior to someone else.  Especially if they are a small, vulnerable minority.Based on the literature, it's less about inner vs. outer parties and more about dominance and submission. The three groups are Right-Wing Authoritarian (RWA) Leaders, RWA Followers, and then everybody else. The rest is the same: the RWA groups form the ingroup, and everyone else is by definition in the outgroup.Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. Hate brings people together it\u2019s an essential part of their base.\u201cConservatives in the 1800s hated the Irish\u2026 as much as they hated Black slaves or women\u201d\n\nAs brilliantly illustrated near the end of Blazing SaddlesGermans weren't white in ben franklins time. He referred to them as swarthyI like the connection to 1984. But I\u2019d say there\u2019s an inner party- those that make the decisions/have the most power and are in control, outer party- those that are figures who are meant to support the inner party but do not have power (they are not allowed to go against the inner party publicly), Proles - who are the manipulated working class that the party both hates and needs. Everyone else is a \u201cother\u201d or enemy to the party meant to distract the proles from criticizing the party. Ignorance is strength, freedom is slavery, war is peace.Irish potato head checking in. This speaks to me.> Conservatives have to have an in-group in which laws protect but do not bind, and an out-group in which laws do not protect but bind tightly.\n\nThat's the law, period.  It protects but does not bind the oligarchs, but binds and doesn't protect the working class.Do you mind if I steal \"Billy Joe Blumberkinnickel\" as a possible drag name?They also have used Communists and Muslims as their us-vs-them group to great success.> They need three groups to maintain control. **The Inner Party**\n\nUh oh...Facts - my dad was spit on in the 60s (from Greece), called a sand n word, other shit  - obviously, he didn't go through what people of color went through, but his first 10 years here were tough - and he's dealt with random discrimination throughout his life, just not systematic racism like what people of color have faced and still face\n\nThey have to hate - the conservative movement is all about hate - if it was actually about politics we would  be able to have a much better government because we could have actual debates about policy and what's best for people but no no they've decided to fully peddle in the hate business because they are greedy demons and it pays and that's the saddest partAint that the fucking truth. I know plenty of mma guys and former deployed military. Almost none of them talk about being badass, they do what they enjoy and happen to be badass. \n\nIt is funny seeing a guy who'd you think is a weeb (anime tatoos)  rag doll other grown men.Sooo true. They\u2019re cowards and bullies.They absolutely can and do attack (cis) gay peopleSome people ARE afraid of it - Trans/non-binary/fluid lives are a stark reminder that staying who you've been told you are isn't mandatory.  Even more broadly - Any time a group tries to break wildly free from the status quo, it's a pointed indictment that things are the way they are because we allow them to be.  That's a scary fucking door for a lot of people.  If my gender identity is mine to choose, what else is mine to choose? For folks at the top - it's a gut-punching reminder that they're only there because we allow them to be.This is true. \n\nAlthough I do think a common link between these policies and the focus on school policies is that non-traditional sexual orientations and gender identities are sharply higher among generation Y teenagers currently in high school. \n\nGay and lesbian people are anywhere between 2 and 3% and 10% of the population, depending on the area. Trans individuals are a tenth of that at best. Tenths of a percentage of the population. \n\nBut some studies have suggested that in recent years, the number of teenagers that identify as trans or non-binary has gone from .1 or .2% to 2 to 3%.  That is the difference between one or two individuals in a thousand students and two to three individuals in 100 students. \n\nThere are a million different potential reasons for this, but it's a very interesting phenomenon. \n\nI do think this perception is part of why they are such a target for reactionary people.Yeah, [Frollo really shouldn\u2019t be making policy decisions](https://youtu.be/U3NoDEu7kpg)Nah they\u2019re fine hiding that side. They literally just need a boogeyman to convince their base to be scared of and a base dumb enough to believe everything they say.>\n>Edit: I should probably point out that St. Joseph is also the home of a college, which certainly makes a difference. \n\nThat makes all the difference in the world. I doubt anybody could find many towns the size of St Joseph which do not have something like a college.St. Joe's newspaper was also the first in the nation to endorse Trump, so I can't give them too much credit.I moved to Tulsa Oklahoma from California a few years ago and wasn't sure what to expect...but really most people here are actually very liberal and open minded.  However all you have to do is drive ten minutes in literally any direction and that flips on a dime, which is why the state is still so solidly red.Not all mid-sized cities are. Cape Girardeau and Branson are probably the most conservative mid sized cities in Missouri.I live in Springfield. I\u2019m a mom of a gay kid who recently showed an interest in being called they. They have been nothing but respected by their teachers who they asked me to talk to. I\u2019m very far left, I don\u2019t consider myself a democrat, I consider myself a socialist. There are a lot of people like me in this area. We have great LGBT support, women owned businesses, etc. We also voted in amazing people for the school board this year(small elections MATTER). \n\nMissouri is so weird. I feel so uncomfortable in Branson and a lot of small towns, but then other ones I feel like I belong. My kid asked if we would be moving after this shit happened and I told them no. Liberal flight does more harm than good. We aren\u2019t in direct danger. IF they were we would leave. I hope my trans sister leaves. But right now our voting power matters. Our support matters(we volunteer at a church that does a lot for homeless along with LGBT youth events).Warrensburg, a fairly small cpllege town about an hour from KC, is also fairly similar.In fact in st Joseph not only do they have pride. But they have a church there (first Christian church) that sponsors pride and puts on drag shows!100% agree with this, I happened to be out in Helena, Montana which hosts Carroll College, a private Catholic university. It was during the city's pride celebration and it was pretty similar to anything you'd see in a smaller college town on the West Coast.Springfield however on the other hand I don\u2019t think is very liberal\u2026My hometown in FL has two major state universities (FGCU and FSW) and is still super red sadly. Education helps but only so much after years of indoctrination, and the town doesn\u2019t have a lot of jobs or much to do otherwise so the ones who do finish school don\u2019t stick around.\n\nThe age demographics of FL definitely skew it but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to justify that when most of the conservatives I knew were my age.>I think a lot of the mid-sized cities are more liberal than you would expect, too. Fifty miles north of KC, St. Joseph has had a Pride parade for years, and this year they\u2019re planning a Juneteenth celebration.\n\nNot all of them. Jefferson City, the state capitol is pretty republican. I've met people who represent as LGBT here at my night job, but there are not very many. It's frustrating how many great community organizations Columbia has which is not even 30 miles away from Jeff.Yeah, drive outside of Chicago for a while. And then eventually you wind up in the southern half of IL where people complain about Chicago taking all their tax money, etc.I drove through Devin Nunes country a while back and good god the billboards that farmers have posted out there about water management are out of science fiction.  These people don't live in reality and somehow are able to still farm.I believe you're referring to Calibama.The difference is that gerrymandering works a bit differently in all of these places. Missouri is thoroughly gerrymandered by conservatives. Last I checked, California is leading the country in anti-gerrymandering reform and Illinois is on the flip side, heavily gerrymandered by democrats...Yeah, I've never understood term limits. It is inherently antidemocratic.Wyoming apparently.It describes almost every state at all anymore. There's something about being rural and not being exposed to people that are different from you that really breeds hate.Even in the south, the urban centers are blue.Hinderlands ;DNot surprised at that. STL County is a real mixed bag.You actually typed that....poor minorities live in slums because they can't afford to get out. Not because it's safer.I grew up in gods country. Small town with two Mexican families. Everyone loved em. Everyone hated the \u201cbad ones\u201d on tv.It's based on a true story:\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/02/trump-kansas-city-missouri-super-bowl-tweet](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/02/trump-kansas-city-missouri-super-bowl-tweet)\n\n>Trump congratulates wrong state for Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win  \n>Trump congratulates \u2018Great State of Kansas\u2019 for Chiefs winAt this point I don't know if you're joking. Granted Idon't know much about either Kansas cities. I have a friend from the Missouri one and she said it was better but that's about it.I mean they've already tried to annex it from Missouri several times, it would be on brand.One might say it's GLAMA-rous!The materials are owned by the University of Missouri so that's probably not an option.That\u2019s good and we\u2019ll, but it always bears pointing out that \u201cjust leave\u201d isn\u2019t a viable solution for the vast majority of people. Whether that\u2019s financially, or it\u2019s leaving your support network behind, or whatever, it isn\u2019t now and hasn\u2019t ever been a solution for the masses when faced with these kinds of issues.Thank you for the explanation. I had no idea.The State is trying to do the same thing to STL as we speak:\n  \n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/st-louis-police-crime-state-control-a93b6cb6aeaa112aebe535d67f08412eMaybe I am naive but, ELI5 why the city can't simply defund or non-comply with it?  I mean, that seems pretty simple as a brute force boot-to-the-head way to whip them into shape.\n\nDefund one, set up another.  Pop.  Done.  Or just bludgeon them with threats of funding cuts.  Just general barely-legal non-compliance.  Etc.That's such a huge percent damn. I just looked up NYC and it's a little over 5%. Obviously bigger city but there are tons of cops and they seem quite well funded with boats, and helicopters etc. They even have anti terrorism units that work around the world.Ok, but we fought a war not that long ago to defeat literal Nazis.Founded doesn't mean still is...  If this kind of thinking was true Catholics would be more like Jesus.Because we didn\u2019t finish the job after the CSA was defeated.It has a reputation for being a LGBT friendly city. Even got Thom Brennaman in some hot water when he called it the \u201cf\u2014 capital of the world\u201d on a hot mic.Joes KC , SLAPS, Gates for the Nooner lunch special. Be aware that things are going to start to be busy with the NFL draft being hosted here this weekend. Hope you enjoy it here!Everyone is going to tell you it's the Joe's on 47th Ave (in a gas station), but it's kinda crowded. Personally, I'm a fan of Slaps in KCK. They don't have a Z-Man equivalent though.LC's is always a classicyes, i'm aware of that. that's why i just brought it up with my brother.So can women wear pants?Drag show/trans laws are blatantly anti-first amendment and discriminatory on the basis of sex.\n\nBook banning is anti first amendment.\n\nWeed is legal in Michigan, but not in Ohio. (Many more examples of the same)\n\nAbortion is legal in some states, basically considered murder in others. Some (Idaho, I think) creating punishments for leaving the state to get an abortion.\n\nA judge in Texas blocking a pill everywhere.\n\nRepublicans in national house committees interfering with state criminal court case (New York v Trump)\n\nThe supreme court is wildly interpreting laws to legislate from the bench, but Congress can't seem to get a judge to answer any questions about their outright corruption. \"Checks and balances for me, separation of powers for thee\"\n\nFlorida governor Desantis said he would block sending Trunp to New York to face charges.\n\nOhio and South Dakota sent national guard to the border...\n\nJust off the top of my headManhattan, KS is slowly shifting blue as well. Emphasis on the slowly..KC has been progressive for the respective era for a long time, consider the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. It shows the progress and attitudes in the city for a long timeReplace Jeff City with Columbia.Of all the cities you could have listed, Jefferson City would not have been a top 10 guess.By contrast you've got Nebraska. Outside of Omaha & parts of Lincoln, the state is a red shit hole.Your comment is making me re-evaluate that line from Blazing Saddles.My guess is a lot of that care will shift to Illinois.  Not that southern Illinois is all that enlightened but it is what it is.I disagree.  Which laws do you propose we should follow if we are to defy \u201cmost\u201d of them?God that\u2019s awful. I love both KC and STL and wish both our cities the best but our state politics are truly making it hard for me to want to stay.how about those many many many who detransition?You're getting downvoted but your perspective is correct; it's hard to understand trans people when they seem to be doing something you would never want to do. Changing perspectives helps, I tell people who don't really get it to imagine themselves suddenly waking up with a trans body of the same gender without bottom surgery; so for example if you are a cis man, you would wake up with your body as if you were a trans man without a penis. Would you want to continue the transition and have surgery to get a penis, or would you be comfortable with a vagina? Would you detransition and live as a woman? Understanding the drive of gender affirmation is hard unless you've lived as a trans person.I never said it was awful and I never said it was a choice, I said it was strange to me.  Try reading what's posted instead of vomiting your opinions into my mouth.  And you missed the whole point which is it doesn't matter what I think, its none of my business.  So stay out of mine.I wasn\u2019t? My comment is specifically talking about how the cops don\u2019t care about minorities in KC and that has hurt the black community there. Bringing in an entire other group of minorities is only asking for their rights to be trampled on too.\n\nMan, the oversensitivity from the left is palpable, and that\u2019s coming from someone who has voted for Bernie twice and has a trans sibling. Did you even read my comment? Or did you just get excited at the shot to defend an argument I wasn\u2019t even making? \n\nIt\u2019s sad that I\u2019ve seen this same type of behavior from the right when debating topics. Emotional responses to what they want to or believe the argument is about, regardless of what\u2019s actually said.I don\u2019t want the government telling anyone anything, btw. People should be able to say or do anything they want unless it is directly harming someone else.[removed]Tell that to Riley Gaines that was attacked last week that\u2019s just one example there\u2019s plenty more on the internet[removed]Adults are able to consent, so right there with you.\n\nChildren cannot consent, so someone needs to standup for children; especially given so many children were in essence \"coerced\" to transition only to regret it and detransition as an adult.Of course, go ahead! \n\nAlso birb tax plsBirb tax is neededSatan's alphabet soup is a cheeky reference to LGBTQ+I\u2019m not 100% sure, but I giggled when I understood that as being a part of the LGBTQ+ community. But said in a \u201csarcastically self-deprecating\u201d way. Loved it.Alas, he's married. His wife and toddler daughter were there and another kid is on the way. Thankfully his wife doesn't seem quite so right-leaning. Hopefully the kids will turn out okay.Your work has an LGBTQ+ slack channel? That's awesome!Not in that wording, but I went to high school with the friend (and also this guy, apparently, though I don't remember) and since I'm the T letter in the soup, it was kind of unavoidable that he would know.Oh I know! Mine gets aggressive sometimes if I accidentally make him nervous - not quite killer rabbit levels, but he'll grunt and lunge, and then I have to apologize to him.[removed]And please understand that the \u201cshift\u201d is just who they\u2019re *pretending* to be worried about when they\u2019re passing discriminatory laws. \u201cIllegal to be gender nonconforming in front of children\u201d is about drag, but really it\u2019s about all queers, and god and the supreme court willing, its about women in trousers.   \n\n\u201cKids shouldn\u2019t be allowed to take dangerous hormonal medications without parental approval\u201d is about birth control.The system is still biased towards whites, except for the \"newly bleached\" (Italians, Middle Easterns, Central Asians)And while they shift focus they never stopped hating those other groups.\n\nJust look at Clarence Thomas saying that gay marriage bans should be brought back.That's valid, if they'd just shut up the shrieking about the 5% of the population they're currently harassing we'd never hear a thing about it. They just decide who they're picking on for the moment and have fits until they make a non issue seem like a big thing to rile up the fools that follow them around.This is why a true 100% democracy would be terrible. Minorities would be discriminated even more.It will never be permanently shut down.\n\nThere will always be radicals waiting to be inducted into the next conservative cult.It used to be possible to destroy propaganda, like the Nazi propaganda networks were destroyed at the end of WW2. But with the internet, the right wing propaganda machine has become a global, self-sustaining beast that will never, ever go away. There is no solution. We were always going to do this to ourselves. I\u2019m certainly not advocating for hopelessness or inaction, but I don\u2019t see a solution really, you and I will be fighting these lies (and new ones) for the rest of our lives.I saw a video threatening that if a transgender man if  he walked into a women's bathroom with his daughter in it. \n\nTurns out, that man was charged with raping a minor.\n\nConservatives don't care about the children. It's something they can use to avoid saying the quiet part out loud (that they just want violence against minorities)The gays got money.  That\u2019s what stopped the laws against them.  \n  \nTrans people need to get money and power, and then finally our capitalist oligarchy will be forced to acknowledge us as people.I\u2019m glad at least one other person got the 1984 referenceI heard an MMA guy talking, when coming up he had a very aggressive attitude and wanted to fight everyone, all the time, over anything.\n\nOnce he got good at MMA, won some matches, he said he realized he could beat the shit out of any normal person.  That realization, that he didn't need to prove himself anymore, made him chill out and stop caring if random people heckled him.It's harder to, that's the point.Not like they'd like to do. I grew up in the eighties when heating on gay people was still a national past time. They want a return to that. And, fuck them very much. That is not happening.People have been told to be afraid of it.  Just like they were told of FEMA camps and Obama declaring Martial Law.What's interesting is they don't think that way(as far as I'm aware of, please correct me) when it comes to someone who is disabled and chooses to augment their bodies with technology that actually enhances their abilities instead of cripples them (ala Paralympics).\n\nAnd it's absolutely true, we only allow the Rich to exist because we *think* they are something bigger than they really are. At the end of the day, they die just the same as us all.Recognizing and accepting trans people is genuinely destructive to the patriarchy, which relies on keeping AFAB and AMAB individuals in their respective boxes.Wouldn't it be liberating that the box others chose for you isn't a destiny you are forced to manifest? That you can choose your own box, even the one that was selected for you, and (to mix metaphors) color outside the lines?\n\nI've almost always felt happier and less trapped when given freedom.No one is afraid, fed up but not afraidThis is where I reply with the chart of left-handedness over time.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ithayla/status/1410339332477517826I can't speak for minors, but Pew data back in [2022 states that 5% of adults aged 18-29 are trans or non-binary.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/07/about-5-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-say-their-gender-is-different-from-their-sex-assigned-at-birth/) I think it's fair to say that there are more people than before, but I'd think it's because people are more self aware on this topic than they used to be - like the left-handedness someone else linked.One thing that can't be overlooked here is those numbers are artificially lower due to the AIDS crisis in addition to any societal pressures.There's a good handful of mid size cities with small colleges in the state, now that I think about it.Springfield also has a college and it is\u2026woof.Haha, Jesus. I wasn\u2019t aware of that. \n\nEven so, I\u2019m not going to hang the city out to dry because of the Newspress being backed by deep right-wing pockets. The EiC\u2019s columns absolutely sway to the right, but they\u2019ve also been good about printing letters and daily \u201cIt\u2019s your Call\u201d comments from the community (right and left). They also continue to print articles by the definitely left-leaning contributor/one-time reporter Alonso Weston. \n\nObviously as the only paper in town, they need to try and appeal to the widest possible audience for sales, and extreme views aren\u2019t conducive to that. \n\nAnyway, my point is, please don\u2019t write off the entire town\u2019s population because of a bought-out newspaper editor.Branson is in one of the reddest counties in America, named after Supreme Court justice Taney who upheld slavery with the Dredd Scott decision...super weird how right-wing politics seem to always overlap with pro-slaveryThat\u2019s why I said \u201ca lot\u201d and not \u201call\u201d. \n\nSt. Joseph has continued to hold a Republican majority for many years, but there is still a huge chunk of the population who don\u2019t have their heads jammed up their asses. \n\nThe same can probably be said for the towns you mentioned.That\u2019s\u2026not how I would have expected that to go in Springfield. But definitely a welcome surprise. Congrats to you and your family.This is why I said \u201ca lot\u201d and not \u201call\u201d.I lived down in the sticks for a few years. The amount of people who are convinced that IL pays for Chicago and not the other way around is stunning.Look into the mirror they must, all of them.Eh. Liberals hate conservatives with just as much energy.Goddamn it why didn't I come up with that? Naming things is *hard*.Yup.  Of the homes in sight of us, it\u2019s either 30-40 yr olds with young kids or retirees.Oh wow. What a fucknut.What makes this even more embarrassing is that KCMO is far larger than KCK and somehow Trump didn't know this.I'm only half joking. KCK is pretty conservative politically and KCMO tends to be far more liberal. Most people outside of the Midwest don't know that the Kansas City Metro area is made up of not one, but two different Kansas Cities in two different states. This tends to really annoy people from KCK because they tend to not like being lumped in with the KCMO folks.I know, just wasn't sure if they could be 'loaned' to a university on a more friendly stateYeah, KC tends to get overlooked in a lot of mob history and media but we were a den of it during the 1920\u2019s and prohibition. \n\nMany of the mansions in the valentine neighborhood have tunnels connecting them in case of raids. \n\n(Kansas City is built on top of a limestone cave system )Should be noted there were a lot of positives to this. Including the city never going through prohibition. As a result we still have super super loose alcohol laws. Including but not being limited to public drinking and being allowed to drink in a moving vehicle as a passenger.Thanks, just another reason to hate the MO state gov\u2026After *they* declared war on *us*. We would have been perfectly fine sitting the entire thing out were it not for Hitler's global ambitions. Fascist sympathizers were not at all fringe at the time.\n\nAlso, we gave them a lot of their ideas. The Nuremberg laws were inspired by Jim Crow laws.\n\nAmerica has been like this since its inception. We're merely dealing with the consequences of its founding.We didn't defeat all of them.Thats propaganda.\n\nWe joined WW2 because we were attacked by axis powers.\n\nYou would do well to remember that the US didn't take in holocaust refugees but did give nazis asylum.Correction: We fought *foreign* Nazis and even that was hardly because we were opposed to fascism, we only joined after being attacked. Meanwhile fascism came to the US a century ago before the war, made it\u2019s way through our communities all the way to Madison Garden and the hearts and minds of many titans of industry and leaders in the US, and then it never left. This is what happens when you don\u2019t denazify your own nation - they don\u2019t just go away, they lie in wait.They degraded the education system to the point where it\u2019s almost as if we didn\u2019tAnd then immediately recruited some of them to fight the USSR.That ignores that a sizeable amount of this country were Nazi sympathizers.Of course, we are literally not Calvinists and slave-owners to this day.  But that doesn't mean cultural traits haven't been passed down through the generations.The 13th ammendment explicitly codified slavery as part of the US legal system. The US still has legal slavery.Yeah, Sherman needed to do some more marching.Pretty sure he was talking about San Fran when he made that comment (even though it was a Cinci vs KC game)Yup that's why I'm coming down! Going to visit some of your museums as well. Super excitedJoes used to be my #1 and it's  still what I recommend but you're right. SLAPs is equally as good (that's why I put it next to joes in my recommendation) more room to sit and the two brothers there are super nice!Ahhhh apologies for the misunderstanding!>For men, business attire means long-sleeved dress shirts, ties and sports coats with trousers and dress shoes or boots, according to the dress code. For women, it means \u201ctailored pantsuits, businesslike dresses, coordinated dressy separates worn with or without a blazer, and conservative, closed-toe shoes or boots.\u201dI know a pretty progressive co-worker moving out there by the end of the month.FactsBut they allow the splitting of electoral votes! They only get 4 IIRC but it always gets us one more blue vote.State-level protections, at least.\n\nI feel for folks who will have difficulty accessing care as a result of it being so far off, though. Anyone know if there is a patient driver system or rx delivery system in the works or anything like that?Laws against violence,  coercion, and theft.\n\nMost other laws create criminals where there is no victim.The fact that people may regret transitioning highlights the importance of all people being able to have access to proper gender-affirming healthcare. Overall, the regret rate of people who have gender-affirming surgery is about 1%, although this percentage does vary based on many factors such as the extent to which proper gender-affirming healthcare is available. For comparison, the regret rate of people who have surgical treatment for their prostate cancer is about 15%.Yeah totally agree. I think the down votes are also because people generally read comments in a confrontational tone, as unfortunately thats the norm these days.Yes sorry. I think I came across wrong, didnt mean any bad vibes. Was just trying to shed some light on being trans.We can both list names all day. There's a lot of people in the world. It's disturbing to see you use this as a way to vilify transgender people, claims that are not supported by actual science.You don\u2019t believe people should have guns? Are you anti 2A?There are about 2,617 documented cases of aggravated assault every day in the United States. The content you find on the internet, including hate crimes, are largely based on your search interests. As I stated earlier, transgender individuals are far more likely to experience violence and discrimination than to perpetuate it. \n\nSuch an indecent you speak of does not represent the entire community, and it's unfair to generalize an entire group of people based on actions you see while scrolling through social media.This doesn't happen. Admit you want trans kids to kill themselves. Why are you conservatives so scared to just state your real thoughts?That is the parent's job not your's or anyone else.https://ibb.co/pL75h4SRabbit Tax please!!!The visual of a noodle amidst more letter-shaped pasta made me chuckle too, like it was a disruptor among all the letters that people shouldn't fuck with if they know what's good for them.\n\nDon't fuck with the noodle.Yup! I've been kind of spearheading the effort at my studio and publisher to actually have them at all.I was making a not so funny joke, as in some groups call FBI, CIA etc alphabet soup; accountants are Satan\u2019s minions; and the guy sounds exactly like a \u201cDon\u2019t take mah gunz!\u201d type.\n\nGlad your friend checked his shit attitude though!You're describing general authoritarianism.\n\nLike a middle ages Lord who gets his knights to fight a neighboring fiefdom. The lord only wants power, but he has to sell the idea of patriotism and xenophobia to his knights so they'll go fight and die on his behalf.\n\nHe has to tear down any respect they may have for their neighbors and absolve them of any guilt of their newfound hatred by describing the outsiders as less than human or guilty of some grievance to justify the knights hatred.Some of the leaders of the GOP are just pretending to be bigots to make the rank and file bigots vote for them.\n\nBut I think you're being entirely too optimistic and generous if you think ALL the leaders of the GOP are just engaging in Performative Bigotry.\n\nTake governor Sarah Sanders for example.  Her father has a long and distinguishedn career of gay bashing both as a politician and as a preacher.  I've no doubt he believes everything he says 100%, and that the shit apple did not fall too far from his shit tree.\n\nOr the unquestioned leader of the Republican party Donald Trump.  He's got decades worth of history of racism and misogyny going back long before he ever thought of entering politics.  There's no question he's not just acting.Way to just rehash a comment and be sorta wrongYou'll always get hardcore conservatives anyway, but when you operate in a two-party system it's in everyone's interest for the more extreme radicals to be defeated as heavily as possible. Until they are many moderate Republicans - if such a thing still exists - will continue to kowtow to the extremists in their party.\u201cignored\u201d would have been a better term. Media platforms come and go, under the right circumstances it can be made irrelevant. But yes it\u2019s an uphill battle for sure.But someone needs to start the cult and get the word out. Eliminate the sources of funding and conservatism will die.I mean\u2026.\u201dDon\u2019t say gay\u201d? If there\u2019s a way to be bigoted against any marginalized group, they\u2019re gonna find it. Institutional homophobia didn\u2019t cease with the the 2015 decisionFear as a motivator is certainly not a new playbook for the GOP, but in this case we're talking about what amounts to an existential crisis rather than some boogeyman scenario.And boy did they spew out those theories non-stop alright...But where are they gonna get their wage slaves if people realize they have self-determination and free will!?!?!?!?!?!?Conservatives are like those indoor cats who get outside once after years and see the big wide world - and freak out and run back inside.Another thing that can't be overlooked here is those numbers are artificially lower due to the AIDS crisis in addition to any societal pressures.Springfield, Rolla, Joplin, Kirksville, Marysville, that one town that Central Missouri State is in?\n\nPretty small places but with colleges. Kirksville I don\u2019t think has very much representation but I haven\u2019t been up there in a long time.And Cape is Rush Limbaugh\u2019s hometown too lol.I\u2019m just giving examples of the ones that are conservative is all and don\u2019t discount the suburbs around St. Louis because they are pretty damn conservative too.Springfield is very weird. I have friends who are die hard republicans who still care about me and my kid\u2019s comfort and respect us. I don\u2019t get that everywhere. Now the suburbs? We lived in Ozark and Nixa and it was much worse. But that\u2019s Missouri. Little pockets of acceptance.Springfield is 40% liberal , 60% republicans and half the republicans are tax break republicans. It\u2019s ok to be gay as long as you aren\u2019t poor.Same story in pretty much any state with one dominant metropolitan area.  We hear this a ton in the PNW about Seattle and Portland.Liberals hate conservatives because of their regressive and oppressive politics. Conservatives hate people because they are look, pray, love differently than they do. Those are two wildly different things.>Eh. Liberals hate conservatives with just as much energy.\n\nWe hate what they are trying to do others, not who they are.  That's the difference.HarderlandsTo be fair, before everyone went apeshit for the Chiefs, how many Americans actually knew that Kansas City was in Missouri? It hasn't really been a blip on most people radars until it's slow revitalization in the last decade.A lot of the collection has been digitized. Hopefully they can digitize everything so it'll at least be preserved that way.And that was AFTER St. Louis voted back around 2012 to take control of their police back from the state, now the state is trying to force them to give it up again.GM operated plants building B-25 bombers (including here at Fairfax in KC) while simultaneously operating plants building bombers for the Luftwaffe in Germany. Henry Ford was awarded a fucking medal by the Reich for his antisemitismGood points. It's still shocking to me that were still having to deal with this shit today though.The Nazis sold out Madison square garden in the 30s, they had a lot of support hereNot only that, we took them in afterwards and made them Americans.> did give nazis asylum\n\nOnly because H1B visas didn't exist yetRemember the St Louis.The US still has legal slavery. While the average American doesn't have slaves our prison system is constitutionally a slavery system.And the pool of \"generations\" is actually small.  I don't agree there is influence, but traits passed down don't exactly mesh with changes made in generations in the US.\n\nSee the \"My Heritage\" crowd for many examples.I'm guessing from your comment that the word wasn't fuck. Because I thought they meant fuck capital of the world and I was thinking coolpartially my fault, as i used \"kids\" to keep it gender neutral and still correct as far as familial relationships. the last i'd heard they're \"gender fluid\", but my brother and sister-in-law, and myself, just want them to be happy, or at least feel like they have the right to try and be happy.What about kilts?Yeah we'll see how long that lasts. Rural regressives were big mad last election.The percentage is not relevant to claims that it is not a choice.S'ok, its a bad time right now.  Sorry I snapped at you.  I think we're all strung out on this insanity going on.Very hard to to belive there\u2019s 2617 every day in America against transgenders I would love to read that we\u2019res that from was it a study if so who studied it over how long of a period an how many ppl were involved in the study an to answer your question no I don\u2019t go looking for hate crimes i was just going by the Riley Gaines ambush an a few othersJokes on you, I do not subscribe to either major US political party.\n\nHow about you admit you will deny any and all evidence counters your preferred narativeand yet adult sex with minors is illegal despite parental consent. And in most US States minimum age for marriage is 18. The State of Massachusetts only recently raised its minimum age from 12 with parental consent to 18.  So there are times when laws override parentsAn excellent birb. \n\nCute picture, but I recognize that look - cute little sucker bit you shortly after you got the shot, didn\u2019t they?Very good birbConures are the best. I had two. They bit me tho. It was a love bite, even if it drew blood.https://imgur.com/a/b3dhs4I\n\nIt was hard to pick just one picture, so I didn't. \n\nHe's also the primary bun featured in the @thoughts_of_bun Twitter/Instagram lolI kind of want art of this now. Rainbow LGBTQ+ letters all around and a spaghetti noodle writing out \"don't fuck with the noodle\" in cursive.Knights were nobility, they lived in castles and had serfs.\n\nThey were expected to fight, but they'd be given armor and would ride horses. The levies (mostly made of peasants) composed most of the general fighting force.\n\nIt was also generally the clergy who'd preach to the soldiers (e.g. crusades)> You're describing general authoritarianism.\n\nWell, also describing the US, so yes.>You'll always get hardcore conservatives anyway\n\nI don't believe that's actually true. You will tend to find that almost every conservative, no matter how insane, has some issue on which they are at least reasonable, if not downright progressive. It's always on an issue that touches them or their close friends/family personally. \n\nThe issue with conservatives is a lack of empathy, but I don't believe that it's low empathy people that become conservatives. I believe it's conservatism that mak4s people lack empathy. And conservatism is spread through propaganda and indoctrination. It relies on astroturfing to make it seem like everyone is conservative, which plays off of well known faults in human reasoning to get people to conform uncritically. If the origins of the conservative propaganda campaign could be found and eliminated then conservatism would eventually die. Some people might still have conservative leanings, but they would lack the organized structure or backing to cause harm.Do you not know what harder means?University of Central Missouri is in Warrensburg, which is also 20 minutes from Whiteman AFB. Lots of diversity because of the military personnel there.That sounds about right.Right. I\u2019m not trying to imply that any of the mid-size towns in question are fully liberal (because they definitely aren\u2019t). \n\nI just take issue with the idea that the only liberals in MO live in big cities, which absolutely isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s easy for people who don\u2019t live in the Midwest to write-off the whole place, and as a left-leaning person living here, it raises my hackles.This is the result of Reconstruction being interrupted and dismantled.I'm talking about the deepest American attributes such as working long hours, very few days off, working through sickness.\n\nThe general attitudes toward the homeless and the poor. Our lack of socially safety net isn't just a product of greed. It's a product of belief in poverty as a moral failing, of poverty as *sin.*Yup, here\u2019s the clip: https://youtu.be/-DD8zpGRqlII agree. I just mentioned it because you brought it up, and made it sound like most people regret transitioning. \n\nGender identity is not a choice because it's a deeply felt sense of one's own gender, which can be different from the sex assigned at birth. If people could just \"choose\" to feel a certain gender, then they probably wouldn't be very inclined to go through all the struggle of transitioning, or de-transitioning, as you say so many do. \n\nWhile people may choose to express their gender identity in different ways, such as through their appearance or behavior, their underlying gender identity is not something that can be chosen or changed through willpower or external factors.I didn't say against transgender people. I mean a lot of people are assaulted every day, so of course you're going to see footage of transgender people attacking others. My source is the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. I think it's up to you to prove that transgender people are inherently more violent, and not me to prove they're not, and saying \"I saw videos of transgender people attacking on the internet,\" as an argument for a very serious issue is quite insensitive.Sorry to disappoint, but no. He likes being held like an ice cream cone and never bites me.GORGEOUS! Black Rabbit of Inl\u00e9 vibes. So regal.So cute! Wish I could give you an upvote for each pic.To be fair, war was the biggest money maker before industrialization. And pre-industrial war wasn't all that deadly compared to regular life. So for many people, especially the surplus labor that agrarian economies always produce (farming families grow to the carrying capacity of their farms, which us usually more than the labor needs of the farm). So war was actually a means of social mobility for the peasants. And the knights, as warrior aristocrats, had to fight and be seen fighting in order to legitimate themselves. \n\nComparing medieval society and economies to post industrial society and economies dosnt really work, it was a very different world back then and whuke scapegoating did happen, it wasn't the same as modern scapegoating and didn't serve the same purpose.Yes, it wasn't in any way equitable by our standards, but making direct comparisons between European feudalism (and similar systems elsewhere in the world) with modern authoritarian systems is, at best, a flawed analogy.[removed]Not all knights were living in castles, and had serfs.  A lot of country knights didn't have much more than the serfs had.\n\nThe only real benefit they had was social upward mobility.Warrensburg! Thank youGo, Mules!I can agree to that concept, but preface it to the point that at this time the minority is driving these now.  The majority of americans do not support these perspectives, but the current political power and control not due to population (minority control) is holding on to these to the point of insurrection.Research appears to disagree about the underlying gender identity; perhaps I misunderstood you comment\n\n\"Of the remaining 128 cases, 12 cases (9.4%) met criteria for GD emerging in adolescence, were actively requesting medical interventions at outset of assessment and ceased wishing to pursue medical inter\u00adventions and/or no longer felt that their gender identity was incongruent with their biological sex.\"\n\n\u2018Taking the lid off the box\u2019: The value of extended clinical assessment for adolescents presenting with gender identity difficulties\n\nAnna Churcher Clarke and Anastassis Spiliadis The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, UKI just gave 2 examples you haven\u2019t givin 1 within the last yearHe looks like he owes you $5.Ice cream cone birb!!!

With the advent of industrialization it is way more efficient to expand the economy by simply building more industrial capacity and educating the workforce. Modern war, besides being extremely expensive, has the effect of destroying industry. This the winner of a war only wins the privilege of having to rebuild all the industry they just destroyed before any meaningful value can be extracted. This is true even for extractive industries. A West African diamond mine staffed with child laborers will never be as profitable and productive as an advanced Australian strip mine, it's just easier to set up. Unless if you are conquering a pre-industrial state and are expecting to win quickly with minimal destruction, war is expensive and produces slow returns. Simply investing more in domestic infrastructure does far more to strengthen a country.It matters because if we are going to progress we need to fix that point.You deny something that is scientifically proven to occur. That is the point of the article, it is research that disagrees with your claimWow why didn\u2019t he reply to this?? HmmmIt's never been about efficiency.  It's always been about controlling resources.Maybe. But we will always be beset by reaction.  For some reason, we thought we could rest on our laurels after Civil Rights and Roe and Oberfell, but we can't.They did reply to it. You can see it by looking at their account. They just make baseless and unfounded claims that all these articles are fabricated lies by the \"far left.\"War isn't even a good way to do that. Neocolonialsm through debt traps and things like conditiinal imf funding is cheaper and produces more value. War hasn't been profitable since industrialization got going. Expecting to profit from War in the short term, except personally at the expense of all the countries involved, is a mistake.It\u2019s that neoliberal \u201cend of history\u201d mentality. Absolutely fucked us.You can do both!\n\nKeep resources away from the working class, by blowing it up, while trapping in debt traps.\n\nNever expect a capitalist to skip any way to maximize profits.>Never expect a capitalist to skip any way to maximize profits.\n\nExcept, War is a bad way to maximize profits unless if you are specifically War profiteering. The fact that capitalist countries keep finding ways to go to war in spite of its proven economic destructiveness is just more evidence that capitalists, as a class, aren't that good at maximizing profits. They are good at oppressing the proletariat though.But China is the nation that does the most debt traps, I mean take a look at the belt and road initiative\n\nAnd I know China is capitalist, but a very party-controlled capitalismYes, you can bet they would be war profiteering.\n\nAnd you maximize profits by using every channel available.   War included.\n\nWar is very profitable, hence why it even still exists.\n\nWhy do you think Russia is invading Ukraine right now?  Why do you think the US invaded Iraq?China also does it's share of invasions.\n\nDid you think Tibet was always a part of China?  Or that China was hands off during the Korean and Vietnam wars?\n\nAnd capitalism is capitalism, regardless of the type.  The need to always acquire new sources of resources to exploit is a foundation of capitalism.>Why do you think Russia is invading Ukraine right now?\n\nRussia is invading Ukraine because it's leaders are actually idiots. The Ukraine wat has cost them billions, destroyed their nation's prestige, and is going terribly on the battlefield. The invasion of Ukraine was never going to be profitable and was only embarked upon because Putin believed when his advisors told him that the Zelensky government was incredibly unpopular and seen as illegitimate by most Ukrainians. The reason for the thunder run to Kiev was because the Russian leadership legitimately thought that there would be no meaningful resistance. \n\n>Why do you think the US invaded Iraq?\n\nThe second Iraq War destroyed American credibility abroad and made the rescission far worse. It cost the US massively and we still haven't recovered as a country. The US has not profited one bit from that adventure. A few rich people got a lot richer though. \n\n>War is very profitable, hence why it even still exists.\n\nI think you are misunderstanding me. I'm talking about profit for the state, the country as a whole. For pre-industrial society invading your neighbor and taking their stuff was the best way to increase one's wealth and power. But since industrialization it has been way more effective to just keep reinvesting in domestic industry. \n\n>why it even still exists?\n\nWar still happens because states pursue interests outside of their economic growth (honor, glory, etc...) and because the interests of elites are misaligned with the interests of the state. Some elites might proffit from war, but it will almost always be at national expense.",

That's how\u201cHow a plague of racism and hate turned into a plague of racism and hate.\u201dArizona\u2019s voting history has long been formed by the GOP. They have controlled the state legislature for decades. They made mail-in voting in the 90s, expanded it, and set the rules for entire voting system. \n\n\nNow, people think Arizona was always red and now it\u2019s turning blue. I disagree. Rather, the GOP\u2019s control was due to the legislature\u2019s constant gerrymandering. This was so evident that in 2000, voters passed an independent districting committee through our referendum process, removing the legislature\u2019s ability to draw districts. \n\n\nThen the GOP sued to stop threat from happening. They lost, but sued and sued anyway. In 2010, the redistricting committee commenced. They redrew the districts fairly, proposed it to the public, and guess what happened? The committee received death threats from Republicans, fueled by online conspiracies. The AG kindled these threatens and conspiracies by opening investigations claiming the committee was in kahoots with the Democrats. None of it was founded\n\n\nThen in 2012, we saw the impact of an independent redistricting committee. More districts started turning blue in 2012. Democrats held offices they never had before. Then again in 2014, 16 and so on. The narrative from the GOP was \u201cCalifornians are moving in!\u201d which is true, but not nearly to the point where it would change the electorate. \n\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t good enough to convince Arizonans to implement enough terrible policies for their liking. And their policies are so bad that they aren\u2019t worth revising at this point So the Arizona GOP leaned into the election fraud idea and may end up burning the whole thing down. \n\n\nDemocrats are just a few seats away from controlling the state legislature. It will mean millions of families get better access to health care, education, and job opportunities. \n\n\nKeep up the fight AZ. We are almost there. They have nothing left but lies. \n\n\nSource: Arizonan\n\n\nTLDR: history of voting in AZ50 years of the Southern Strategy has turned 25% of US adults into knuckle dragging rage monsters. Republicans lost control of them after Trump was elected, and now all they can do is keep feeding them more and crazier lies or they might get distracted by a squirrel.imagine if you had to include a picture of your face next to every comment you posted\u2026theyd be so civil and politeSo Glad I moved away from AZ.Be a billionaire. Create millionaire underlings that work In the mass media to influence the culture and government that may try and regulate me and use them to do my bidding by holding the purse strings of their pathetic subclass bank accounts.I also have a problem with the whole idea of demographic shift being blamed on migrants from other States. Conservatives move too and younger generations are less conservative than the older ones everywhere. It is also possible that migrants from other States kept politics more conservative for years longer than it would have without migrants. That is definitely what is happening in Florida and is probably what is happening in Texas.Facebook says otherwise.The irony being that the Californians that came aren't a monolith. They is no chance every one was a Democrat vote. \n\nIndeed, If you look where I live in Idaho it's actually mostly conservative Californians moving in. Lies and false flags is all there GOP has at this point.There was a poll during the 2016 Senate race in Texas that showed those who were born in Texas preferred Beto to Cruz by 10 points. One poll isn't conclusive proof but it is evidence of a counter narrative.\n\nCalifornia used to be much more conservative 15-20 years ago. Some of those conservative voters may have changed their positions but a lot of them probably just moved.",

Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the US District Court in Washington, DC, would have the exclusive authority to hear civil lawsuits seeking court orders with nationwide force \u2013 including orders known as nationwide injunctions \u2013 that go beyond affecting the parties in a case.\n>\n>\u201cWhen parties are able to choose their judges, it creates the perception that they are able to predetermine their case\u2019s outcome, compromising the integrity of our federal justice system,\u201d Hirono said in a statement. \u201cActivist plaintiffs should not be able to hand-select individual judges to set nationwide policy, which is why it\u2019s critical we address the issue of judge shopping in our federal courts.\u201d\n>\n>The bill would preserve the ability of a party, if they were seeking a court order that would only cover themselves, to file their case in their local federal court.\n>\n>Ten of the 14 active judges on DC\u2019s federal court are Democrat appointees. Democratic appointees make up of six of the 10 active judges on the DC circuit.\n>\n>Given the current Republican control of the House and the bevy of other judiciary-related matters Democratic lawmakers have spearheaded, it\u2019s unclear what traction Hirono\u2019s bill will get in this Congress.At least she is trying to bring forward meaningful legislation.  Just because Repubs won\u2019t vote for it doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t push change over the long run.Yea it\u2019s going no where. Republicans will not support this at all. Judge shopping is the only way they can cling to powerAnd.... once again... Democrats are governing and Republicans aren't.  What has McCarthy done?  Passed the Parent's Rights bill.  Anything else besides manufactured outrage, brinksmanship and culture wars?This is meaningful, thoughtful, and pragmatic  legislation that will ,unfortunately, be dead on arrival by GOP.Hey, no fair! First you want fair elections,  now you want to eliminate judge shopping?   Republicans will never get anything done now!It's a policy you would think both sides could get behind, is common sense and I would say probably a popular idea amongst average Americans. So it's got a 0% chance of actually passing.Republicans are lining up to pass that /sI like the concept of the bill but I would just change it so they have to file in the district the plaintiff resides in. Having everything go through DC gives one district to much power. All nation wide rulings should be done like en banc panels with a good faith effort to have a 50/50 split of democrat and republican appointed judges.Great idea.   Hope it gets tractionI am okay with this, but just so you know, this was the biggest meme the Magas had 4 years ago. Hawaii Judge blocks Trump once again. \n\nBut I am okay if they is a reasonable and constitutional way to do this.That\u2019s a great idea and needed now, too many judges being bought and are tied to special interests. Look at the US Supreme Court five judges bought and traded by Republicans and report to back to the Republican Party masters of political influence.In theory the idea sounds good, but  places too much power in one court (Washington DC)How will Republicans be able to block federal policies with no legal grounds just because they don't like them without this? Won't someone think of the poor billionaires this will disproportionately affect?I like the idea of not being able to judge shop. But putting it through one district gives that district too much power. It become as difficult to get new judges on that court as the Supreme Court. \n\nSomeone mentioned a random assignment. While not perfect it will stop court shopping since you don\u2019t know who will hear the case while not giving one court too much powerGiven that our government runs, well supposedly anyway, on a system of checks and balances, can't a single judge simply overturn the bill to block judge shopping?Judge shopping sounds a lot like judge bribing to me.I agree we need to stop judge shopping but requiring these types of cases to be only heard in DC causes a new problem and that is a lack of judicial process by creating a new barrier to entry for plaintiffs. Her constituents are going to fly from Hawaii to DC for every court date?Why is CNN not naming the Senator proposing this? Is name recognition a privilege for certain Senators? Give her full credit for this!this taxpaying citizen supports this!This would have way more credibility if the new plan wasn't to just throw every case AT A JUDGE SHE SHOPPED\n\n\"oh judge shopping is an issue so lets decide every case in DC, one of the most reliably blue courts in the nation\"\n\ncmon be seriousHow was this not already a thing?Sounds like something the Republicans would oppose.great then the single judge in hawaii won't be able to block republican policies for years like she did in 2016-2020Interesting idea, but are the Dems willing to give up their pet judges in Hawaii and Washington to stymie the GOP's pet judges in Texas?Can't wait until this backfires.Why the Fourth Circuit in Washington DC?  Why not the First Circuit in Boston, or the Eighth Circuit in St Louis?\n\nIt's time to move more US Government stuff away from (not into) Washington DC.That\u2026. wouldn\u2019t actually solve anything and in fact might make things worse.Wait! Judge shopping has been going on for hundred of yours. Why spoil the fun? I used to sit on the Bench as a State Superior Court Clerk. \n-\"Yes counsel, what brought you to my court cause you nor none of your clients are on my rotation lists?\"\n-\"Your Honor, Judge Smudlap is conflicted out and Judge Soup To Nuts has my clients three other cares and can't do this one?\" \n-\"Counsel, Good bye! Go back to Judge Soup To Nuts and deal with it!\"\n\nHeard it a lot from the same attorneys all the time. \n\n(Yes, Judge's names were changed to military slang names to protect our hard working Judges!)What a waste of time.This will not go anywhere as 1. Dianne Feincorpse WHO IS ON THE SAME COMMITEE continues to be absent.They are only doing this because they expect to not be picking a judge... it's good but it's so self servingAnother half assed move by Crazy Mazie.  The court does not have enough bandwidth to handle that requirement and no prospect of changing it.  \n\nThink about it politically...Dems were fine with judge shopping under Trump,  When their own tactic gets used against them, they are whining.  Typical of Crazy Mazie.Judge shopping is a staple for the Democrats, this bill if passed, will only be applied to \u201cMAGA\u2019.How is this nutjob still in office??!!How about this instead: no one's personal case should ever have a nationwide impact. It's your deal. You win your case or get your injunction good for you, but don't bother the rest of us with it. You feel strongly enough that a law is unjust, awesome, run for Congress that's what it's there for.Didn\u2019t read the details. But if I know anything about the Federal Government I know this: if it\u2019s a good idea it\u2019ll go nowhere.How about this instead: no one's personal case should ever have a nationwide impact. It's your deal. You win your case or get your injunction good for you, but don't bother the rest of us with it. You feel strongly enough that a law is unjust, awesome, run for Congress that's what it's there for.Not only is the bill going nowhere, but, even if it were to pass, the forum shoppers would just find some loophole that would be accepted with a wink and a nudge from the compromised elements or the Judiciary. The problem is far deeper and, IiMO, requires a re-ordering of our understanding of how the Constitution functions and the degree to which judicial decrees striking down duly-enacted legislation are accepted by the elected branches.I agree that judge shopping should not be allowed, but also limiting it to one area is also bad.\n\nI think it should be randomly assigned.For realI was wondering where all the progressives went. They all disappeared!The common phrase judge shopping tells us just how corrupt our Judiciary branch of government has become! SHAMEFULdEmOCraTs aND REpUblIcAns aRe thE sAme!I am an independent and was going to say that she's right and that the current system lends itself to people skewing a trial in their favor. But then again, we are a 2 party system and the judges are already being either voted in by or appointed by their parties or constituents. A judge's job is to be impartial, no matter the issue at hand. If they're not being impartial, out they go.Nuts and bolts, sure, it'd be a win for most causes of decency right now. In the abstract? It just shifts judge shopping to the halls of power where the decisions are made about which judges are in that particular pool. Pillow theory of power. You can't actually attack the root shenans. The GOP gets a few judges in there, BOOM, this backfires spectacularly.\n\nIt also imposes an additional cost on the occasional good-faith litigant who's out in bum-fuck wherever but needs to file suit in a court that's a thousand miles away.It'll never pass.Both parties judge-shop.  Politics.It's about time.\n\nPoliticians to further their agenda have made a mockery of our judicial system.Wouldn't this create a massive bottleneck in DC judges?This is going nowhere, sadly.  It's needed badly, but sadly I don't even see some Dems like Manchin and Sinema supporting this in the Senate if it made it that far because it's too integral to Republicans and their big corporate donors and special interest groups.I like the idea overall but I would add in that the Judges that are allowed to do this should have term limits. They can still be judges in other matters but may only be a part of the group that preside over national cases for a limited amount of time.This isn\u2019t a good idea. Each district court is supposed to be equal. This gives one court more power than the others.  And if this court has a strong political bias, we are worse off.Why on earth would it be decided by a DC district court? DC is not even a state. Am I crazy or is this possibly the dumbest solution to the problem? How about having the judge randomly selected? Or a rotating panel of judges that vote?This is a bad idea because if the composition of Congress changes the republicans could just pack the DC court or wait until the democratic appointees then appoint judges to that circuit.\n\nI thought of an idea a couple weeks back where if you have a Judge in a single district ; then the case has to be allocated randomly between the closest two districts including where the line Judge is ; that way you've lowered the ability to Judge shopIronic coming from Hirono considering Hawaii was a favorite location for judge shopping when Democrats were trying to block Trump policies.So the legislator wants to prevent judge shopping for universal injunctions by forcing litigants to file their suits in a district court with a democrat appointed majoirty?\n\nHopefully republicans kill the bill.Here's another for-show bill that will go nowhere because House republicans will kill it.Right. Put them on record voting against it.You gotta start somewhereAbsolutely.  Take the Inflation Reduction Act as an example.  Would that have passed with the Federal Government's largest spending on climate action ever without the Green New Deal being pushed a few years ago?  Probably not.\n\nWe need to be bringing these bills to the forefront early and often.  Proactive, even, because then the narrative gets set and conservatives need to play catch-up.That's assuming there will be a democracy after the Harper v. Moore decision.  While this is a great gesture, it is ultimately futile in its attempt to reign in on this sort of judicial bullshit.   When people say America has been lost for a generation, they are speaking about the rigged judicial system.   Good luck, America.  You'll need it.It will never be brought to a vote in the House.  But sure, I guess you can get GOP Senators on the record.*One of the waysWell it\u2019s certainly how they invalidate laws that they don\u2019t have the votes to kill in Congress\u2026Republicans don\u2019t support anything meaningful so might as well put the thought out there and shape legislation that one day could pass.\u2026considering virtually all nationwide injunctions come out of the ultra-liberal Ninth Circuit centered on California, I\u2019d say your facts are 1000% wrong.\n\nThe DC circuit is even more liberal, considering DC itself is like 93% registered democrat. This bill, while claiming to prevent \u201cjudge shopping,\u201d essentially guarantees a liberal judge will see every matter seeking a nationwide injunction.\n\nGee, democrats who want unfettered control of government?? Whoda thunk??Get them on the record opposing it.Imminent debt ceiling crisis... again!But it helps to continue the dialogue arguing for badly needed changes to the outdated judicial system.Yes, because the bill would funnel the cases to the most liberal court in the nation.Wouldn't work. In the Texas Mifepristone case, they judge shopped and setup their LLC in his district.The filing in specific districts is how they judge shop though.  Unless I'm misunderstanding your meaning.\n\nI do agree however that it shouldn't be funneled through the DC circuit, or it should be spread out more through random assignment.  Still not a perfect solution, but better than it is now with so many impactful cases going to a few sympathetic judges.It would be nice if something like this would but there\u2019s no way the GOP is going to give up their rubber stamps in Texas without a fight.Random assignment incurs even greater expenses. You would either need to fire your law firm and start over from scratch once you get assigned to a court, or spend tens of thousands of dollars flying your lawyers to a different state every week, then back home for every weekend, and putting them in hotels until your trial is complete. Compared to the cost of needing to fly just yourself to DC, even from Hawaii, that's prohibitively expensive.It also clogs up that one court.Would require standing I'm guessing.They might try but Congress does have the authority to set the broad outlines of which courts can hear which cases.Did you even read the text? You only have to file in DC if you want the ruling to apply nationwideHer name is in the second paragraphAt least in DC, you're getting one of ten random judges assigned to your case, only six of which were appointed by Democrats. Right now, Republicans are filling in locations where there's only one federal judge eligible to hear the case. Republicans are literally selecting the exact judge to hear a case, and you're saying that's the same as picking which ten judges the case will be randomly assigned among.\n\nThat's some remarkable partisan bias you're showing in equating two things that are a full magnitude of order different.Because the fourth circuit in DC is favorable for Democrats, if it wasn\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t be putting this bill forth, and if it ever changed they would go on about needing to repeal it to stop conservative judges from having so much power.Getting rid of nationwide injunctions would be the worst possible solution to the judge shopping problems. \n\nBasically, you would need thousands of dollars to challenge law that was already unconstitutionalSo you think that literally every single litigant who's aggrieved by, say, somebody injecting religion into a public school should only get a ruling for their particular thing, even if it's happening all over the place? Are you therefore stumping for the end of all nationwide *precedent,* or are you just demanding that once a precedent is set, literally everybody has to go to federal court to get a *res judicata* hearing and an individual order?\n\nHave you thought about this soberly for five seconds?When the shoe\u2019s on the other foot and your court case is dealing with an egregious violation of Constitutional rights, the country would benefit from an injunction against the tyranny. \n\nThe courts are part of the checks and balances, for what it\u2019s worth.Well, yes, but there are backlogs everywhere. The courts haven't been expanded since 1990, which is when this country had 82 million fewer people.Pity we couldn\u2019t just appoint more judges to fix the backlog.This may sound radical, but Congress has power to expand the number of judges in a circuit court, and could use it to expand the number of judges to avoid a backlog in the DC Circuit.No, very few cases have this type of effect on national policy. We just hear about them most because it\u2019s always news when they happen.\n\nAlso we just reversed a very long legal precedent allowing states to do things they hadn\u2019t been able to do since 1972, which is going to create a bunch of lawsuits challenging the states actions on what was once mandated an action protected under the right to privacy.Better bottlenecked in DC than having a Texas judge end decades of FDA regulations because he\u2019s a religious fruitcakeYes.\n\nAlso, wouldn't this just let congress pack a single district with sympathetic judges?And all the incentives for the conservatives and Federalist society to do to the DC Court what they did to the Supreme CourtI would imagine they'd stop doing shitty things that are just gonna end up in DC's lap, considering they only started doing them because they had judge control.Could be a strategic move to justify expanding the judiciary. Dems must be bullish about holding the Senate and White House for a while.[removed]We should have the number of judges it takes to adjudicate all the cases there are. If we need more, we should appoint moreIt would also put a huge target on this court in particular.It would also put a huge target on this court in particular.Probably, but hopefully it would also just discourage people from filing so many lawsuits seeking to set national policy.Well, we don't need to worry about Sinema supporting this since she's not a Dem anymore, she's an \"Independent\" now.Yeah, this seems like a pretty heavy-handed and problematic solution to a very real problem. A more elegant solution is needed.If the parties seek injunctions affecting only themselves, they can file in their local district. Reading the article helps.Are all districts even close to equal now? Are 8 & 10 close to 9 & 5 for instance?The D.C. district hear tons of cases involving the federal government (more than anywhere else) and probably has the most experienced bench for cases involving any type of injunction involving the U.S. government.  It also has a dedicated circuit court of appeals with similar expertise on the bench.While supporting the intent of this proposal by Sen. Hirona, I think your option may be a better overall solution to the problem while preventing further stacking of a single Circuit with political favorites, conservative or more progressive. Judge shopping is a real problem no matter who is doing the shopping.Rotating judges is the norm. Unless you file in jurisdictions with only one Federal Judge. This is solely to address what happened in TexasThe DC District Court is a federal court, just like the District Court for the Northern District of Texas that conservatives file all their cases in.It\u2019s a dumb solution that will never be accepted because DC itself is too heavily democrat controller. If people wanted an actual solution it would be randomized as you said, but nobody actually wants a solution because they all judge shop.> Ironic coming from Hirono considering Hawaii was a favorite location for judge shopping when Democrats were trying to block Trump policies.\n\nIts something both sides have abused and ending the practice will benefit everyone in the long term.So, you support this, right?There's nothing ironic about it at all. \n\nSen Hirono has condemned the practice on both sides and her bill  stops the abuses of the court. Something that the Republicans have taken to an entirely new level to destroy people's freedom and inflict pain on powerless groups.Do you have some examples?  I know the 9th Circuit, which includes Hawaii, was pretty active, but I mean, it includes over 60 million people, so you'd kind of expect it to be.[removed]Currently a democratic majority, which could change between administrations whereas judges in the middle of Nowhere, Texas are unlikely to be less biased for the foreseeable future (or Hawaii, as the Democratic counterpoint). Judge shopping should end though, even if this doesnt end up being the solution to it.NahIf you were an AI chatbot I would tell you to delete your own code>Hopefully republicans kill the bill.\n\nYeah, then they can continue to cause needless pain and suffering to satisfy the vile misogyny and stupidity of their base.[deleted]They won't vote against it. They just won't allow it to ever come up for vote.Yes, putting evil people who feel no shame on an irrelevant list is definitely the way to go!They just wont vote on itUnless there\u2019s at least 10 republican senators who *will* vote for it, there will be no vote at all. Our lovely filibuster system /sGet the legislation written, then you can try and copy and paste it into future bills.Moore v. Harper is probably mooted out by now but go off lolYeah, don\u2019t forget gerrymandering, \u201cvoter fraud\u201d laws that target minorities and the poor, and dismantling education, among other things! They work hard to cheat their way to power and they don\u2019t appreciate when we don\u2019t recognize their hard work.What decisions have come out of the 9th circuit that breaks with longstanding legal precedents?The last sentence is chef-kiss level stupid. Democrats are half-assed trying to stop minority rule but you\u2019re treating it like conservatives aren\u2019t the party of activist judges. You cherry pick details to make something false look true and it\u2019s fucking exhausting. \n\nYou know why this is wrong just like everyone else reading it, so can you please just notThe DC Circuit is already seen as one of the more influential courts precisely because of the political groups that are based in or around DC. It\u2019s a huge supplier of SCOTUS appointees too, both liberal and conservative. Roberts, Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Brown Jackson all come from the DC circuit. More recent former members include Scalia and RBG. \n\nAlso, on current composition: 8 members, both active and senior judges, were appointed by Republican Presidents. 9 by Democrat Presidents. Among strictly active Circuit Judges, not including Senior Judges, 4 are from GOP Presidents (3 Trump and 1 GHW Bush) and 6 from Dem Presidents (4 from Obama and 2 from Biden), with an open seat available.\n\nSo how exactly is this \u201cguaranteeing\u201d a liberal judge? Yeah, it\u2019s likely, but certainly no guarantee.[deleted]Democrats represent a super-majority of the country--they should have unfettered control of the government. The only lesson the past 30 years teaches is that conservatives destroy the economy, the country's institutions, and foreign relations every time they come anywhere near power.\n\nFucking clowns in the house can't even get a budget written.This is nonsensical. The district court bench is not meant to be reflective of the political makeup of the area it covers. Especially so with DC: since the residents of DC don't have Congressional representation, there is no DC senator to blue slip nominees that are too conservative.Gee, Democrats want to stop republicans from breaking the judiciary and taking away fundamental human rights.\n\nFuck repugs and right wing reactionaries.Whereas now they can just send all their cases to Amarillo, Texas where there is a single federal judge who also is a far right whack job...how is that any any better than this?Eh DC district and DC circuit are pretty evenly split when compared to like the ninth and fifth. \n\nThe APA goes through DCCC and that\u2019s been fineYeah we would need another bill to deal with this specific issue. Not sure how that would function though.Actually a random court assignment is better. This way you can\u2019t judge shop, but at the same time doesn\u2019t give one court excessive powerWhat I was attempting to get at was forcing the plantiff filing to file in their home district. There would probably need to be companion legislation to deal with issues like the abortion pill case to disallow someone opening up an LLC in another district for the sole purpose of filing lawsuits. I am not sure how any of this would function in detail but I really fucking hate judge shopping and both sides of the aisle do it and it needs to stop.Considering the GOP controls Congress, that's actually not even remotely reassuring.Did you even read my comment? How does a resident of Hawaii get equal protection if they have to fly to DC for every step of the way in the judicial process?Most people scroll and read only the headlines. Name recognition and awareness of what actions a politician takes matter. Especially at election time.An accusation of republican partisan bias is somewhat hilarious. Seen my profile?\n\nMaybe take a look inward, you're getting paranoid.That's wild.  The country's population has increased by about 33% in a period of time equal to about 13% of its age since independence.And every attempt to make the Government more effective, the GOP opposes it. There are so many examples and instances of this.\n\nThe GOP campaign on the idea that Democrats \"love big government.\" No. What Democrats love is \"effective government.\" A government that can adequately serve its citizens. Meanwhile, the GOP are working overtime to strip away freedoms from Americans.\n\nThe differences could not be more stark.DC on the other hand would to my knowledge be a bright blue spot on the map, and also absolutely deserves statehood.[removed]Which would also benefit society by diluting out the trump and bush judgesAlso have the power to expand the number of circuits, which might not be a bad idea either. Especially if we codify a method of determining said circuits. Say we have 15 of them, each circuit should therefore cover a 1/15th of the population, or close as reasonable possible. So how about we say each circuit has to be made up of a group of contiguous states. Then we start with the largest state, start adding adjacent states until we reach that 1/15th. Heck, make it price is right method, the closest while not going over. The only problem is what to do with Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nEdit: Or, we could just get rid of circuits entirely and reorganize around individual states, and require the case be within their jurisdiction to be heard. Interstate disagreements go to the Supreme Court, but they're going to have a huge increase in work load so we'll have to just expand the size of the Supreme Court to handle it right?There've been proposals to break apart the gargantuan IX Circuit which covers every state west of the Rocky Mountains. The IX Circuit hears more cases than any other federal appellate court and has 29 judges. The proposal would shrink the IX Circuit and create a XII Circuit out of part of it.gridlock would also help conservatives, would it not?We still need her vote to have a majority.It's especially heavy-handed since the DC district court is fairly liberal, so anyone right of center will immediately view this not as a way to prevent judge-shopping, but as a way to get these cases in front of judges more favorable to liberal arguments.\n\nIf you wanna fix the problem, we should suggest a neutral system that is unlikely to systematically favor either side.Randomly assign judges to nationwide impact cases, and have the judge travel rather than the plaintiff.I get that.  But if it becomes a nationwide issue and only one court can handle it, that court becomes more important and we can expect fights like we see for SCOTUS. \n\nOn a side not it\u2019s also interesting that it has a 6-4 democratic nomination lean, with one open seat. Would she suggest the DC circuit if it had a republican lean?  And a 10-4 democratic lean in the district court for judges nominated by democrats.The makeup of the DC Federal District Court truly has nothing to do with the politics of the district, because it's still a Federal judgeship confirmed by the Senate, but DC has no Senator to use the \"blue slip\" to try to block appointees.\n\nDemocratic domination of the city is irrelevant here.I 100% support ending judge shopping.This is my point.  Judge shopping is a horrible practice, but Democrat politicians are making an issue about it now because it\u2019s negatively impacting their priorities, and will use the corporate media to say \u201cRepublicans are totally worse than us\u201d.\n\nThe reality is that both parties have abused this practice equally but people here are indignant about it now because when Democrats hit up Hawaii judges for national injunctions to stop Trump policies they were fine with it because the ends justified the means.https://time.com/5717541/nationwide-injunctions-trump-administration/Holy shit that guy and the op of that thread need serious professional help.https://www.reveddit.com/r/confessions/comments/icszac/i_hate_women_feels_good_to_finally_admit_it_i/g2rhfgm/\n\nArchived comment since it appears they deleted the post.They\u2019re not the people I care about keeping it for. I want their places in history seared into as many documents and records as possible.Yup, this bill is dead in the water. But talking about it is a good thing.Too much Reddit for you..Such as an omnibus bill which is considered a must-pass?What do you base on?Or how about Puerto Rico alone has the population of Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, and South Dakota combined. Sure, Vermont has progressive senators, but even if we balance out, republicans get a 6 senator handicap in the senate by winning massive rural states with tiny populations. Republicans, with a *massive* head start are so fucking unpopular they can often *barely* control the senate. If PR and DC get statehood they\u2019d likely never control the senate again, and rather than have better policies they\u2019d rather just disenfranchise as many people as possible.That\u2019s not the relevant question. The relevant question is where the nationwide injunctions come from. The secondary question is the makeup of the DC circuit, where maizie wants all injunction demands to go (and of course the DC circuit is liberal - it\u2019s not like maizie wants those cases going to a conservative circuit, now does she??)[removed]My 25 years practicing law says you\u2019re wrong. And yes, it also gives me the confidence to know when I\u2019m correct.Another factually false liberal post.\n\nThe liberals do not have a \u201csupermajority\u201d in government whatsoever.  If they did they\u2019d control the house veto proof. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s the Dems who have slaughtered the economyYea. He\u2019s an absolute moron. I sympathize with any of his clients.Amarillo Texas isn\u2019t a federal districtAnother bill saying what exactly? \"You can file in the district you reside in EXCEPT if you live in Texas and you judge shopped and setup an LLC in the district\"? \n\nSo we have to write a new law every time someone does something like that? Good luck. They probably won't even be able to pass this one, what makes you think they'd pass several about the same thing? \n\nBest solution is to give DC district all that power because the other way clearly isn't working, and you're not going to be able to nickel and dime every exception with a new law.The only real solution is either purely random assignment, which incurs huge additional expenses making such lawsuits prohibitively expensive for some clients and drains the covers of organizations like the ACLU, or to do exactly this and say anything that would be nationwide has to go through courts located at the nation's capital.\n\nThat's more expensive than filling in your home district, but less expensive than random assignment, because it's a fixed expense. If you're living in FL and hire a FL firm to represent you, but your case is assigned to a judge in CA, you're now spending tens of thousands of dollars on plane tickets, hotels, and other expenses for the duration of the trial. If, instead, all cases go through DC, you simply hire a DC firm and you're the only one who needs to travel, and only when you personally need to be present, which is not for all hearings.The Democrats control the Senate currently.Equal protection has absolutely nothing to do with the distance to the nearest federal courthouse.\"I'm not a partisan, just arguing against my own claimed side for no good reason and using bad logic that doesn't hold up under even basic scrutiny!\" <- okay, but how is that better?The US population has doubled since 1958, which is one quarter of the time since independence. \n\nBut I was really just pointing out our institutions need expansion if only to deal with increased population. And yes, that would entail at least a 33% jump in the size of our federal judiciary.\n\nalso, as an aside, the US House of Representatives hasn't changed since the US population was 94 million.What\u2019s even worse is we haven\u2019t had the house expanded in like 100 fucking yearsand the world has increased in population by about 50% in that same timeIf you really want to see something crazy look at the human population over time. 1800 1 billion 1927 2 billion 1960 3 billion 1974 4 billion 2022 8 billionPopulation growth is exponential, that\u2019s why it can grow and shrink quickly relative to life spans, with the correct conditions of course.And pretty much every state court system is way busier and more understaffed than the federal one.> And every attempt to make the Government more effective, the GOP opposes it. There are so many examples and instances of this.\n\n\"Man, if only Congress could just pass more laws easier. This could never ever possibly backfire!\"> And every attempt to make the Government more effective, the GOP opposes it.\n\nI gotta disagree.  When it comes to cutting through red tape and granting expansive powers to a handful of top bureaucrats, the GOP has been trailblazing straight back to the Nixon Era.\n\nRepublicans have championed bills to shrink the size of state legislatures, to outsource authority to tightly controlled appointed bodies, and to geld community-led opposition to state and federal policy through both legal standards and criminal sanctions.\n\nThey've been *highly effective* at juicing business profits, seizing private lands for corporate benefit, stalling any effort to hold polluters and white collar criminals liable, and waging an endless series of wars abroad for the enrichment of a handful of MIC insiders at home.\n\n> What Democrats love is \"effective government.\"\n\nThat's blatantly untrue.  Democrats are more than happy to embrace an ineffective, inept, and corrupt leadership just so long as that leadership puts a veneer of social liberalism on top.  From Krysten Sinema's Girl Power campaign for US Senate to Pete Buttigieg's \"Look at my adorable family, and ignore our crumbling infrastructure\" tenure at the Department of Transportation to the nightmarish police states of mayors Eric Adams, Lori Lightfoot, Andre Dickens, and Sylvester Turner Democrats have betrayed their constituents time and time again going back decades.\n\nBut then so much of the Two Party system is a facade anyway.  All of these candidates would have been right at home in a Liberal Republican administration of the 1980s.  From Gruesome Gavin Newsom to Legless Abott, the policies differences remain superficial and increasingly irrelevant.  The United States is a one-party state but, with typical American extravagance, they have two of them.\n\nUnless Americans can get passed the bullshit, we're going to plunge ourselves into a Civil War over light beer.How will Republicans be able to block federal policies with no legal grounds just because they don't like them without this? Won't someone think of the poor billionaires this will disproportionately affect?This also creates an implicit requirement to increase the number of Supreme Court Justices, since one of their duties is to preside over one or more of these circuits. \n\nMore circuits justifies more Justices.It would make more sense to just abolish the idea of districts. District and circuits date back to when judges had to ride around to hear cases. It's fruity to keep doing it. Lets have a single law for a single country. Then NO ONE can pick their judges. You get lotteried into the entire countries district.Diluting the massive power the Ninth Circuit has would be great.That already happensThe DC court is already more important considering a lot of federal legislation is litigated through it. I would be in favor of the bill regardless of the court's leaning.I thought it was implied that we are referring to the DC court, not DC itself, based on the comment I replied to. Apparently not. The *DC court* is too heavily democrat controlled at the moment for this to be an acceptable solution to get enough votes to pass, making it a non-starter political fluff move. Which is all politicians are able to do these days it seems.Your point is irrelevant. Who did it and when and which party they belonged to is irrelevant to the current context. You can chase yourself in circles all day with BuT wHaT AbOuTs.\n\nWhat matters is that the potential for ongoing abuse exists. Here's a bill to stop both parties doing it. It's much more relevant who takes initiative to put a stop to the practice, and who votes for/against that initiative.I like that the very first sentence is, \"Over the weekend, a federal judge in *Oregon* temporarily blocked a Trump administration rule requiring immigrants to prove they can pay for medical care in order to get visas.\"  Hawaii literally isn't mentioned once in this entire article.  Oregon, California, and DC judges all get mentioned.  Do you have examples of Hawaii judge shopping?He deleted the original, so I spent more than thirty seconds and grabbed it all.\n\nIt got worse.Oh I already screenshotted all the worst of it, I'm used to them deleting in shame.[deleted]Oh absolutely. And debate now can be used in the future. Just being realistic about what to expect now.NC Supreme Court is rehearing the case with a new conservative majority and will likely avoid the doctrine NC is relying on before the Supreme Court, basically making the argument moot since there is no argument for the court to rule on.\n\nThe whole thing is bizarre. The NC Supreme Court agreeing to rehear a case for no reason other than to ignore precedent almost immediately after it was set is incredibly unusual, but that's the way conservative judicial activism works.\n\nIt's not certain that it's moot, but it probably is now. At least until some other state has a reason to argue for this absurd legal theory.From what I\u2019ve heard PR is actually rather conservative no? I\u2019m still in favor of it gaining statehood if they want it, because something something taxation without representation, but I don\u2019t know that it would be the democratic stronghold republicans fear it would be. Quite the opposite actually. DC on the other hand would to my knowledge be a bright blue spot on the map, and also absolutely deserves statehood.If only we could combine multiple shitty red states into a single red state. Enough of this using vast swaths of uninhibited land political power.Considering the DC circuit is the closest one to the seat of the federal government, it makes sense.\n\nIf you're going to claim that any forum they choose holds activist judges, then choosing the one location nearest the federal government breaks that argument.\n\nNot our fault republican \"policy\" is unpopular within the boundaries of the federal government.>The relevant question is where the nationwide injunctions come from.\n\nWhy should one judge have the power over a national injunction? \n\n>The secondary question is the makeup of the DC circuit, where maizie wants all injunction demands to go\n\nIs the DC circuit court different that the other circuit courts in terms of responsibility, yes or no?That is literally the opposite of what\u2019s actually happening in real life though. You are projecting republican strategies onto democrats as if they are the ones doing it. Next you will be going on about democrat gerrymandering and how they stole some seats on the Supreme Court.This was explained above. You've won nothing. republicans are trying to break democracy.I've dealt with many boomer lawyers who have been practicing for decades and are still complete fucking morons. \n\n25 years of legal practice means nothing about the correctness of your opinion.Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell are just two of many examples that you can practice law for quite a long time and still be an absolute fucking moron. I suppose that makes you a third example.My 80 years in the Galactic Senate beats your 25 years of practicing law. \n\nYou can go to the land of make believe and you can pretend. But in the end you still have no friends.You shouldn't just blatantly lie like that. It's generally frowned upon to be untruthful. Especially when you just want to validate the rampant sadism of conservative thought.Then could you explain why you think it matters how many registered Democrats reside in D.C. if there's no blue slip arrangement for that circuit, and the judges are simply nominated by whichever party holds the presidency and confirmed by whichever party holds the Senate?I didn't say they were a super-majority in government. I said they have a super-majority of the population, which is true.\n\n>If you haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s the Dems who have slaughtered the economy\n\nNo, it is covid that slaughtered the economy, and it was Republicans in government who refused to take it seriously and Republicans in public refusing to abide lockdowns and masks that let it run rampant. And it's Republicans' corporate-tax breaks that are driving inflation. And much of the inflation is global in nature anyways. The US, under Democrat control, is currently the nation least-impacted by global inflation pressures. \n\nDemocrats didn't slaughter the economy--we saved it. Republicans handed democrats a patient that was bleeding out of the femoral artery--they can't now point at the patient that they themselves stabbed and say we're responsible for the patient's unsteady condition. Nor can you deny that the patient would be dead but for the tourniquet we've applied.How did they slaughter the economy?Northern district of Texas, Amarillo division.Maybe put the financial burden of the randomness on the federal government itself? Randomly assign judges then have *them* travel to DC for the trialSo as long as the GOP never takes back control of both houses and the Presidency, we're safe.Yeah but we're down a member of the Judiciary committee because Diane won't fucking retire/resign\n\nGOP is blocking any motion to temporarily replace until she returns from her latest illness- the committee is evenly split without herBefore you continue to spew nonsense, you need to read up on Base Plus Six Review which is the standard the SC uses to determine the scrutiny under which due process (and therefore federal equal protection) is evaluated. The third basis is whether a law is the least restrictive avenue available. Zero chance that\u2019s the case when you limit court access to a single specific location.\"my own side\" lmao. This isn't team sports, some of us are *literally* fighting for our lives.\n\nHow about if you propose a law against judge shopping you, I dunno, randomize the fucking assignments. You don't just pick a court that happens to be majority one way or the other and go \"there, fixed!\"\n\nHypocrisy is stupid and should be called out.[removed]>The US population has doubled since 1958, \n\nThe World wide population has more than doubled in the same amount of time.Well it\u2019s certainly how they invalidate laws that they don\u2019t have the votes to kill in Congress\u2026Even worse than that, is we still allow essentially empty states to have the same number of reps in a house as a state that houses a large percentage of the nation's population.[It's amazing what industrialization can do.](https://www.statista.com/graphic/1/1006502/global-population-ten-thousand-bc-to-2050.jpg)We haven't had an equal number of circuits and justices since I believe 1866.  Things got a little weird there during the civil war - we had 10 justices for a bit.\n\nI'm not saying I disagree, I just don't think it is a given it would happen with more circuit courtsI agree with the sentiment, I think there has to be a better way. Like a lottery system. You case is randomly assigned. This was it stops court shopping but doesn\u2019t make one court more powerful than another.I mean, even in that case, the composition of the DC courts is actually the most transient due to a lack of blue slips (and the fact that the DC Circuit Court is a pipeline to the Supreme Court - 4 of the 9 previously served on the DC Circuit, and three of those are in the conservative camp)\n\nRealistically, any reform of this sort is DOA because the Republican Party has a set up that works pretty damn well for them: register an LLC in Amarillo,and go chat with the **one judge in the District**. And for that reason, no reform is going to get the votes regardless of how you structure it. One camp has exactly what they want under the status quo.\n\nSo yeah, it's fluff, but it's not because of the use of DC Federal Courts. It's because the opposition doesn't see this as a problem to be solved, and we all know it.I\u2019m not disagreeing on the way forward.\n\nMy previous comment was in response to this comment;\n\n>Something that the Republicans have taken to an entirely new level to destroy people's freedom and inflict pain on powerless groups.\n\nIt\u2019s fine if people want to focus on the future but when they make this comment then call the response to it whataboutism that\u2019s a bunch of bs.Sorry I didn\u2019t realize we were talking specifically about Hawaii.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/17/558354914/federal-judge-in-hawaii-blocks-trumps-third-attempt-at-travel-banJust like read a history book or something. Records are how things are shown to the world later. Okay so if I get locked up for being a leftist I would rather the whole world know who did it and why. Then just being like oh well shucks. Let\u2019s just let the steamroll us instead of pushing bills forward and showing we\u2019re not giving up.Somebody's not living up to their username today.PR is, and please understand I am not an expert, to my understanding centrist/center left for the most part. They are somewhat socially conservative but will likely vote in favor of dems. The GOP is very openly hostile toward PR, and in general POC, I\u2019d imagine they would feel in much better company with the Democratic Party. But you\u2019re right, it\u2019s by no means a guarantee that PR would vote fully blue down the ballot.\n\nD.C. is incredibly blue. If memory serves, like 93% of D.C. voted for Biden in 2020. When the election was called in his favor there were parades in the streets, people standing on cars waving American flags, dancing in the streets, passing around bottles of champagne. It was pretty wild, but I think a combination of Covid weariness, Trump\u2019s disastrous handling of, well, basically everything he touches, etc. really put people in a celebratory mood.How is this different in terms of getting the judge you want?\n\nI'm on the left, but I'm actually agreeing with how conservatives see this. If the DC court is majority liberal then asking them to be the ones who handle all of this is just using judges we already agree with.\n\nWhether the judges pull facts out of their asses or try to get into the minds of a 12th century dung farmer for legal precedent is another story. It just doesn't help with the image of courts.\n\nIf the whole argument is about jurisdiction then the cases should be limited to their jurisdiction somehow. I don't know the answer to that, but it doesn't seem like this is the way.[removed][removed]> the typical active federal district court judge as noted above closed around 250 cases this past year, and had 268 pending cases\n\nNote that this is an average. Some federal judges close *thousands* of cases per year. And if the judge is away in DC, then none of those other cases can proceed until the judge returns. Discovery can take months, and all the pre-trial hearings take up a substantial amount of a judge's time, which is why it's important for trials to be carefully scheduled: they're a huge block of unknown length when other business can't be conducted. But you'd be creating a scenario where even pre-trial hearings generate a huge block that impedes the progression of unrelated cases. We'd need to add dozens more federal judges to make that remotely feasible without impacting current caseloads dramatically.\n\nAnd remember: justice delayed is justice denied.Why are people traveling in the first place? Just video conference that shit.Yeah, Feinstein not retiring is annoying at this point. I feel bad for her being in poor health but at some point she honestly should step down so someone else can fulfill her duties because right now she\u2019s not serving her constituents in any capacity.That\u2019s nice, remind me again\u2026 how many federal Supreme Court buildings do we have and where are they?I've already posted elsewhere in this topic about why random assignment is prohibitively expensive. And DC may happen to have a bias, but it's also where the nation's capital is. Picking the 9th Circuit would be partisan hackery, because there's no logical reasoning behind it. Picking DC is the only logical circuit if you're going to narrow things down, and there's nowhere in DC where you can guarantee getting one specific judge to hear your case, unlike in Texas.\n\nIt's not hypocrisy, and claiming otherwise is damaging to democracy.Now now, lets not oversimplify. They have many evil tactics they use to cling to power. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, gutting education to name a few.\n\nSaying this is the \"only way\" implies that if we fixed this things would be fixed, and we know that's not true. It also understates how many evil things are necessary for them to barely cling to power. The downside is it means there's not a silver bullet, the upside is it means there are many ways we can try to scrape our democracy back.Both sides do it. Will there be equal enforcement?You mean the senate. The house is proportional to population.Um, aktuly this is what the large-slave-holding populations of the South wanted when they ratified the Constitution, so its good.note that I said 'one or more circuits'.\n\nI was talking about 'admin' workload, not maintaining 1-for-1Cases are randomly assigned within a division at least, I think there should be minimums on how many judges sit within a division to mitigate this somewhatAll right buddy just say you're a partisan hack and move onYou literally were the one talking specifically about HawaiiIt's gonna be 87 in california today. Dudes probably heatedDid you feel the same about the folks judge shopping in that mifipristone case? Or when Aileen Cannon have trump a pass on classified docs at maralago?\n\nAlso, they live local to DC. It\u2019s their local court. There being primarily democrat judges is just the reality that they find themselves in. There are always going to be little quirks like this in systems. The side suggesting it is not the side who is eroding our democracy, so I am not exactly buying the crocodile tears.\n\nAnd I personally thing it absolutely matters that republican judges are looking for reasons to roll back your and my rights. They are beckoning on fascism, so I don\u2019t exactly care if their brain-dead supporters look at something like this and then decide that the courts appear to be corrupt. They have had dozens of opportunities to see the actions of the courts over the past 6 years and come to the realization that one side is seriously putting their thumb on the scale, but in saying that this \u2018breaks\u2019 it for them, then they were lying and already saw it as brokenThe latter!That last line is serious? \ud83d\ude02>need to add dozens more federal judges to make that remotely feasible without impacting current caseloads dramatically.\n\nIf there's such a backlog issue we should be doing this *anyway*How cute that you think the SC holds themselves to the same standard they hold lower courts to.People honestly disagreeing with you on how the government should work is what democracy is all about.\n\nHow do you think the constitution was drafted? What do you think congress is for? What do you think voting does?House districts [average 760,367 people per rep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_congressional_districts), but since every state is guaranteed a minimum one house rep and the 435 reps are apportioned across states of varying size, you can have a variance that ranges from Delaware at-large (989,948) to Rhode Island's 1st (545,085).\n\nIf you consider 989k and 545k proportional... well... *shrug*The 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act kinda threw a wrench in the whole design.Yes, I do mean the Senate, which is one of the most undemocratic structures government can possibly have, besides just a dictator.\n\nThe Senate is a house of the bicameral legislative branch.  Ie, there are two houses of Congress.\n\nI used \"house\" rather than \"the House\".This is a fine example how so many people don't know wtf they're talking about and yet still get upvoted because other ignorant people like the message, skewing Reddit's perception of reality.[removed]Yes. They believe that garbage. Except this dude also seems to think that throwing around fake credentials and gawd means he can't be wrong. \n\nHe's the same kind of joke that the people forgetting to log in to their burner accounts to cosplay as a black person are except he's pretending to be a lawyer. Probably salty that his pic showed up on the \"behold the master race\" subreddit.Good luck getting either party to vote for a massive expansion of the courts that will be filled with candidates the other party gets to pick.No answer? We have one federal Supreme Court and it\u2019s in D.C.\n\nThe same Constitution that created it also grants Congress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d inferior courts as they see fit.\n\nYou have yet to demonstrate how any of this implicates equal protection at all, let alone to the extent that it would restrain Congress from exercising their article III power to determine not only how those courts operate but whether they even exist.\n\nYour arguments are absurd and transparent, and your behavior is obnoxious.It was drafted by a bunch of slaveowners refusing to cooperate with a handful of abolitionists unless they got free bonus votes, guarantees that their slave patrols wouldn't be disarmed, and that no matter what, *women* wouldn't get to vote. There was no democracy involved in the establishment of our nation.That\u2019s just a handful of the districts that have a weird anomaly like that of the 435That just capped the number of seats, not proportionality. This last census we saw some states lose seats and some gain based on population change. The real problem is gerrymandering the districts and closed primary systems.I think it\u2019s an innocent mistake probably was thinking senate and typed houseDamnnn I just got lawyered so hard.Way to miss the point by about 40,000 ft.A handful of districts containing millions of people, which is kinda the problem.\n\nIf we were talking about 9k versus 5k seat districts in a House delegation of 43,500 we could at least scratch this as marginal.  But we're talking two orders of magnitude larger scope.\n\nThe idea of representative government at the scale of millions really does begin to break down.  How do I have a representative advocating for my behalf in the legislature when its impossible to even get in the same room with my elected rep without a $5000 lunch ticket?Except that proportionality doesn't properly reflect the growing size of the states population anymore.\n\nThis goes into detail on how this can cause some states to be over-represented and some under-represented \n\nhttps://apportionment.us/Ladewig&Jasinski.pdfBoth are real problems.  We have some districts that have 4x constituents, than others, which enables packing districtsNo, I was quite purposefully pointing out we have a horribly undemocratic house in every state, and at the federal level.  Since they all mirror the bicameral legislative branch.\n\nAnd we did that to appease slave owners, and for no other reason.Maybe, but I see the sentiment so often in here it just makes me wonder. Is civics still taught in school?[removed]Oh, sorry, did you want me to address that Congress exists to thwart the will of the people and ensure that, despite direct democracy having been proven to work in those states that allow it, we never get a chance to shape the federal laws which can overrule state laws using that same democracy? That voting exists to preserve the *veneer* of democracy, even as politicians choose their voters rather than the other way around through gerrymandering, and the vast majority of Americans will never have any effect on the presidency with their votes because of the Electoral College? America is a failed experiment, and has been flawed from Day 1.Those states that get screwed on house representatives are benefited many times over by their representation in the senate. I doubt they would want to change the system.Well you\u2019re right about civics I\u2019m second guessing myself now maybe they will chime in and let us know! I suppose that\u2019s why I made the comment, just in case it wasn\u2019t accidentalprob not, and def won't be in rutherford county now that they have approved #hillsdale heist with their cult curriculum and censorship.  sold out on their children's future.  kudos to robertson, montgomery and maury counties for saying no....> Those states that get screwed on house representatives are benefited many times over by their representation in the senate.\n\nIts not an issue of \"state\" benefit, but of constituent benefit.\n\nThe Senate is an awful institution at any scale.  But we used to have House districts on the scale of 15k-30k people.  Now they're thirty times as large and raising all of the same fundamental problems with constituent attentions.  If I've got a problem that I need my Congressperson to solve, I need to have thousands of dollars in disposable income to be so much as noticed.What size do you think districts should be? Even if you tripled the house size they would still be big and still be growing.\n\nItaly recently voted to shrink their parliament significantly supposedly saving a billion a year \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54244025.amp\n\nEach rep makes 174k a year plus they get money for staffing, furniture, travel stipends, they have a pension too. \n\nUnless it\u2019s something really small like you mentioned (30k people) I don\u2019t think 400k or 900k makes a difference in accessibility> What size do you think districts should be?\n\n>> [That in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, these words be struck out, to wit: \"The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative, and until such enumeration shall be made;\" and in place thereof be inserted these words, to wit: \"After the first actual enumeration, there shall be one Representative for every thirty thousand, until the number amounts to\u2014, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that the number shall never be less than\u2014, nor more than\u2014, but each State shall, after the first enumeration, have at least two Representatives; and prior thereto\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment)\n\nI think going back to Madison's original intent would be a good place to start.  I might even go smaller.  New Hampshire has 3000 person districts.  I might even go further and suggest that the idea of House Districts in the modern era doesn't work well.  \n\nIf I could just go completely back to the drawing board, I'd give every American a write-in ballot slot for House and grant a given candidate a seat if they could rally 30,000 votes from anywhere in the country.  That solves a host of problems - gerrymandering, partisanship, people knowing who their house representatives are and having reps who enjoy an interest in engaging directly with their voters, money in politics (since the value-add of surplus voters is minimal relative to the networking effect of a dedicated base of supporters), federal politics being increasingly divorced from geography - that historical geographic districts carry with them.\n\n> Italy recently voted to shrink their parliament significantly supposedly \n\nIt also happens to consolidate power in the hands of an increasingly partisan and nationalist legislature.  Relatively easier to whip 201 votes than 330, especially when you get to do the redistricting.\n\n> saving a billion a year \n\nOr 0.1% of the national budget.  I mean, if you care about the money, I'd just peg the Congressional salary to the median residential income.  That's around \u20ac45k.  Oh, hey look.  I just saved Italy four billion a year.\n\n> I don\u2019t think 400k or 900k makes a difference in accessibility\n\nI think it doesn't matter in so far as it phases a lot of people out of the process entirely.  But marginally, there's a very obvious numerical difference between 400k constituents and 900k constituents, assuming you plan to engage with more than a handful of political insiders on a regular basis.",

What he wants to do is destroy faith in government in order to establish a Libertarian billionaire utopia. He\u2019s still working on that, it just doesn\u2019t involve donating to candidates because he has already helped turn the election process into a shitshow.[removed]Or maybe he\u2019s backing a dark horse in the wings. Regardless, I don\u2019t trust this guy at all.For those unfamiliar with Thiel (from 2018):\n\n***Palantir has secretly been using New Orleans to test its predictive policing technology***\n\n*The program began in 2012 as a partnership between New Orleans Police and Palantir Technologies, a data-mining firm founded with seed money from the CIA\u2019s venture capital firm. According to interviews and documents obtained by The Verge, the initiative was essentially a predictive policing program, similar to the \u201cheat list\u201d in Chicago that purports to predict which people are likely drivers or victims of violence.The partnership has been extended three times, with the third extension scheduled to expire on February 21st, 2018. The city of New Orleans and Palantir have not responded to questions about the program\u2019s current status.*\n\n*Predictive policing technology has proven highly controversial wherever it is implemented, but in New Orleans, the program escaped public notice, partly because Palantir established it as a philanthropic relationship with the city through Mayor Mitch Landrieu\u2019s signature NOLA For Life program. Thanks to its philanthropic status, as well as New Orleans\u2019 \u201cstrong mayor\u201d model of government, the agreement never passed through a public procurement process.*\n\n***\u201dThey\u2019re creating a target list, but we\u2019re not going after Al Qaeda in Syria,\u201d said a former law enforcement official who has observed Palantir\u2019s work first-hand as well as the company\u2019s sales pitches for predictive policing.*** *The former official spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss their concerns with data mining and predictive policing. \u201cPalantir is a great example of an absolutely ridiculous amount of money spent on a tech tool that may have some application,\u201d the former official said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not the right tool for local and state law enforcement.\u201d*\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd)He\u2019s such a turd guzzling scumbag.\nLiterally just an awful person.\"We have a problem with poor candidate quality.\" - Mitch McConnellImagine being gay and donating to Republican culture warseither:  \n1. he is lying  \n2. he spend money directly on online advertising, without giving it to the candidatesPeter Thiel is the Roy Cohn of his dayIs Thiel the one who kills young kids for their blood?Pete's the economy crashing guy. Get with it peopleWow! When you've become so much of an authoritarian shit show that even Peter Thiel thinks it's too much.\n\nTime to read the room, Republicans.Trump sucker\u2026but he\u2019s got dozens of shell companies who will!I don't believe him. He is a fascist who loves this shit, and they are giving him free reign to rat fuck his way to more profits.No point throwing money at a party that just wants to curtail personal freedoms and has no other policy ambitions.  GOP only wants to restrict what drugs you have, what medical procedures you have, how private companies like Disney operate, what beer you drink.  Biden will easily win.Man looks like he keeps teenage boys in his basement. Such a ghoul.Because he knows that no amount of money is going to displace Biden. It\u2019s not often that a sitting President loses re-election. When they do, it\u2019s because they royally fuck up. \n\nTrump - a treasonous and morally corrupt person that drove up debt, spending, is responsible for thousands of deaths based on his horrendous COVID response, and alienated entire sects of Americans based on his views. \n\nBush Sr. - looked the American people in the eye and said \u201cread my lips, no new taxes\u201d, then promptly raised taxes\n\nCarter - the economy fucked that saint.Why does a gay billionaire support republicans against his best interest? Follow the money. He is the epidemy of republican mindset; Fuck eveyone, just lower my taxes because all I care about is my pocket.Narrator voice:  He will.He won't fund candidates, he'll fund organizations that fund candidates.He\u2019s just going to fund a super pac so his money won\u2019t be so easy to trace back to him.This vitch deserves a federal prison cell next to Trump. And being taxed into poverty.you better find some trickle down shill to fund, because we are going to tax the shit out of your billionaire ass.This just means Thiel will be making donations stealthily like a ThiefI always found it interesting that Peter Thiel, married to a man, loved funding anti-LGBTQ candidates.Same guy just got New Zealand citizenship\u2026.News about a POS, he definitely has a can of gas that will be thrown into the dumpster at some point.Because he knows 2024 is lost. Trump (or Desantis) has to win all of Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia and that's just not happening with abortion and other rights on the line. His picks couldn't get it done last time before Roe was overturnedThe Republican party is a machine that converts white people outrage into tax cuts for rich people. If it isn't working properly, some of those rich people are going to sit out.Bullshit. It's all being funded into PACs.Wonder if he doesn't want any more scrutiny into his life or stuff like this:\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2023/03/23/peter-thiel-jeff-thomas/Yes he absolutely will. It just won\u2019t be disclosed, or it\u2019ll be dark money through a PAC. Or he\u2019ll just happen to buy the Republican campaign manager\u2019s ranch for 500% of what it\u2019s worth. \n\nIf a Republican \u201cmega donor\u201d kept up his donations from 2015-now, nothing that\u2019s happened in the past 2 years should change his mind. He\u2019s all in on the culture war, white supremacy, brinkmanship politics, and coup attempts.\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is that it\u2019s no longer the best idea to be that way openly.Much of the GOP would happily strip Thiel of his wealth and put him in jail for being gay.Doesn't calling Peter Thiel a republican understate how insane he is?Well, have you seen the cost of teenager blood recently? Gotta save somewhereYou mean the gay super villain who hates women and non-white people doesn't care for daddy desantis? I can't imagine why.He'll just donate to PACs to fund them insteadI'll take that as *hopefully* being realistic.Maybe if Hulk Hogan was running?Sure, he'll just donate to PACs with dark money that will fund candidates in 2024.Until he does and says that woke democrats made him vote fascist. Because he is one.Won\u2019t bribe*I'll believe it when I see it. Dark money is real.Is that because Putin is writing checks directly this time?Funny how money will make ***gay immigrant*** billionaires support ***anti-gay, anti-immigrant*** parties...LOL bull shitUS is an oligarchy, these billionaires buy elections for corrupt politicians so they will collectively give them tax breaks. It\u2019s disgusting.Yeah don\u2019t buy this for a second. Proxy leversOf course he won\u2019t, his super pacs will.Narrator: he willPeter Thiel and his ring of Bond villains is the closest thing to a real life conspiracy theory you can get. \n\nPeople genuinely trying to destroy society to better fit their billionaire appetite.  It\u2019s not just greed, it\u2019s ideological.Not directly of course. Plenty of other ways to fund them that are not as regulated.Maybe he won\u2019t fund *candidates* but he didn\u2019t say anything about super PACs.He says that. I don't trust a word this man says.Alternative title: gay man realises the fascists he has been funding might come for his rights next.Haha! Gay libertarian surprised to learn that total freedom means people are free to indulge in anti-gay bigotry.   \n  \n\nWe need a bot that just posts a reminder every time \u201clibertarian\u201d is mentioned on Reddit.\n\n\"Libertarians are like house cats: absolutely convinced of their fierce independence while utterly dependent on a system they don't appreciate or understand.\"I'd like to live in a country where 'megadonors' don't exist.Won't fund candidates **on the books**. \n\n\nHe's already funded a shitload of PACs.He'll go full Koch brothers & fund a system to get what he wants.Which Supreme Court Justice has a mother that needs a house?Peter Thiel, absolute horrid pile of shit..When this fucker finally goes into his bunker in New Zealand I hope somebody backs up and places a load of cement over his air shafts.I\u2019d bet anything he\u2019s going to just dump a bunch of money into the campaign of whoever wins the Republican primary.I don\u2019t believe him.Yeah right.  This pos will just hide itMissing a \\*wink\\* in the article titleIf anyone had enough money to be a mega donor, we aren\u2019t taxing them nearly enough. How about we fix that?From Wiki: Clarence's Citizens United opinion \"would have struck down the reporting requirements\". The whole thing stinksRepublicans are down to bare bones extremist supporters. Their hate and lies arent working anymore. We have real issues to deal with now, a direct result of their strongarming through unpopular legislation as well as being openly corrupt, stupid, or racist.  2024 is going to hurt for them. I imagine after the landslide loss the party may finally start turning back to sanity but it wont matter and its not likely. They have disillusioned entire generations and in 20 years or less the word Republican will be as synonymous with evil and hate as Nazi is.He'll do it in private now after getting embarrassed in 2022.What a load 9f bunk this article is.  He is not stopping his funding of candidates...lolSure, and pigs will begin flying. As if I\u2019d believe anything that a eugenicist oligarch saysHe\u2019s gonna try getting laid insteadHe will. It\u2019ll just be by proxyWhy?  Because they won\u2019t win. Why? because of abortion alone?  YepIn the words of Public Enemy \"Don't believe the hype\".Just Supreme Court justices who don\u2019t need to campaign.Yeah, right.\n\nHe\u2019s an asshole who only cares about money - of course he\u2019s going to fund candidates.Probably busy siphoning teenager blood into his systemThe fact the ohrase megadonor exists means our democracy is not really a democracy.He doesn\u2019t want to piss off Trump or DeSantis.So he says. Charles Koch pulls this stunt every few years and the money never stops.I bet he\u2019ll fund misinformation instead.That\u2019s probably not trueSure he won't...Fuck peter thiel for killing deadspinI don't believe you.Maybe because he knows it\u2019s a lost cause.Tucker and Don off of Fox and CNN \n\nSteven Crowder's wife is divorcing him\n\nTed Cruz caught in damning coup attempt tapes\n\nNo 2024 money from one of the main Republican money men\n\n\n\nRepublican losing week please keep up\n\n~~let's be real, don being off the air is net good~~> Thiel is married to businessman Matt Danzeisen, with whom he has two toddlers. Concerns about his family's safety have weighed in Thiel's decision to step back as well, the source who knows him personally told Reuters.\n\nHow on earth can someone be gay with two toddlers and still identify as a Republican these days. That's unbelievable to me after everything the Republican Party has presented over the past few years to undermine and attack families like Thiel's.Uh huh. _Sure_.Oh shit, Thiel is probably betting on a military coup.If you believe this, I have one of the Hawaiian islands for sale.Ah Elon Muck\u2019s fuck buddy.Bullshit. He's still going to funnel money to them through super PACs. He just doesn't want his name associated with the shitty policies he will still very much be responsible for supporting. Zero credibility douchbag.Yeah ok, whatever you say PeteThere ain't a snowball's chance in hell I'm believing this freak. Fuck him, fuck everything he's ever touched, and fuck anyone who's enabled him.Let it be known that Musk and Thiel\u2019s entire agenda is to destroy the US and takeover. They are backed up and have the blessing of the world\u2019s most powerful fascists and the dark forces from within this nationOh he will just through shell companies 501(c)3s and 504's. Totally dark money on its way.Translation: He is funding all of them and playing the field, but won't admit it because it will make Trump mad.Peter Thiel is a true piece of shit. He's a despicable, hateful, greedy, self absorbed asshole. The world needs far fewer people like Peter Thiel.At least not so any one can trace...Fuck this guy with a sandpaper dildo. To pretend that the Republicans haven\u2019t OBVIOUSLY been heading in this right-wing, pretend-reality, authoritarian direction since Obama won his first term is to lie to one\u2019s self.I\u2019m calling bs on that one. He just found a better way to hide the flow of funds and his influenceBecause he knows 2024 is lost. Trump (or Desantis) has to win all of Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia and that's just not happening with abortion and other rights on the line. His picks couldn't get it done last time before Roe was overturnedI love how republicans are always whining about George Soros like they didn\u2019t have this chucklefuck throwing millions at them. Well I guess now they don\u2019t lolThe new future of dark money, you can disavow those in public you support through back channels, which NO DOUBT he is doing.Oh how thoughtful\u2026 get fuckedWhy did your ex-boyfriend \u201cjump\u201d off that balcony, Peter?He definitely wouldn\u2019t use dark money to support lower taxes R candidates who pinky swear they don\u2019t \u201chate the gays\u201d, then act surprised when they immediately caucus with Rs who openly want to put him in the kind of place that has an \u201cArbeit Macht Frei\u201d sign over the entrance.  Nope, he\u2019d never make that mistake.  Again.He's lying to you.Funding a PAC is technically not funding a candidate.Peter Thiel is insane and a menace.What did the GOP say that pissed you? \n\nDid they say \"gays are the reason hurricanes occur\"? \n\nDid they say \"Dont say gay\"? \n\nDid they say \"gay rights are not equal rights\"?\n\nWhat exactly did they say? Which one got you? When in the last 50 years did they say it that got you?Oh so he\u2019s just going to stop telling the public who he\u2019s funding. That unlimited dark money in politics doesn\u2019t just stop.According to chatgpt, here are some ways for Peter Thiel to anonymously donate to political parities.\n\nhere are a few ways that some individuals may choose to donate to politics anonymously:\n\n1. Donating through a third-party organization: Some organizations, such as donor-advised funds or 501(c)(4) groups, may allow individuals to make anonymous donations that are then directed to political candidates or causes.\n\n2. Donating with cryptocurrency: Some political campaigns may accept donations in the form of cryptocurrency, which can be more difficult to trace than traditional forms of payment.\n\n3. Donating through a shell corporation: In some countries, it may be possible to create a shell corporation or LLC that can be used to donate to political campaigns anonymously. However, this is not always legal and may be considered a form of illegal campaign finance.Horse shit. The dark money will flow to those most likely to destroy the country\u2026 that\u2019s his ultimate goal: theistic, technocratic monarchy hybrid with fuckwads like him and musk at the top. Basically what it is now, but outright.yes he will, absolutely he will. He just doesn't want to PUBLICLY give money to Desantis, Trump or whoever else because they are flinging shit at each other and it's not clear who will emerge as the leading candidate. Trump is apparently blasting desantis in polling but Trump is also facing very real charges and multiple court cases that could put him literally unable to run for president next year.\n\nThiel will donate 10s of millions to superpacs along with all the other billionaires around.Didn't we resolve to call American oligarchs oligarchs a while ago?Good. That fucking racist POS is like a gilded age vaudeville villain made fleshSeems like the Republicans are happy to accept his cash, but:\n\nWhat did he get for his donations, anyway?\n\nAny R-E-S-P-E-C-T? \n\nOr was it just tax cuts? 'Cuz Republicans will always do that, for free...I call bullshit. He'll spend hundreds of millionsHe means that his multi-billion dollar tax-free Roth IRA will be contributing a shit ton of dark money to 501(c)4 orgs which will contribute to political orgs which will contribute to candidates.A single person makes headlines for \"not donating\" to any candidates. Is this democracy in America breathing it's dying breath?Totally understandable, it's hard to find fascist candidates that are willing to tone down the homophobia, transphobia and misogyny.What\u2019s worse than a greedy billionaire? A Christian fundamentalist greedy billionaireI still miss Gawker. Fuck this fucker.I\u2019ve often wondered if these American Oligarchs get together and brainstorm on how to destroy the America as it becomes more progressive. Just like Elon Musk was dared by his Wealthy friends into buying Twitter. Did they discuss how this could stop the resistance or how Billionaire John Malone bought CNN. It reminds me of the old Star Trek Series episode The Gamesters of Triskelion. Kirk, Uhura, and Chekhov are trapped on a planet where abducted aliens are enslaved and trained to perform as gladiators for the amusement of bored faceless aliens. Or Deep Space 9 you have the Ferengi culture is depicted as hyper-capitalist, focused on the acquisition of profit as the highest goal. That sounds like all these American Oligarchs even more. They don\u2019t just want to be Rich beyond their dreams. Just Google US Subsides (Google gets them too) and see how much Taxpayer\u2019s Money goes to those with Wealth.>Thiel is married to businessman Matt Danzeisen, with whom he has two toddlers. Concerns about his family's safety have weighed in Thiel's decision to step back as well, the source who knows him personally told Reuters.\n\nI just don't understand how smart people can be so stupid. Does this Cretin not know they hate him? Greed is the only answer I can come up with.Person who should no longer exist will shadow fund seditionists who will use their power to destroy you and everyone you care about but hey no need to do anything about that they aren't important enough to get off the computer for are they? How selfish, stupid, weak, pathetic, short-sighted, is the modern American left? The current crop of Americans for change could never accomplish anything like our predecessors who EARNED Civil Rights, Labor Rights, Women's Suffrage. These losers would tell you that what these groups did was impossible in the modern day. \n\nThey don't want change they want something to whine about. If you want change you're not getting it whining online and you aren't getting it from the Federal Government who allow confirmed Insurrectionists to hold positions the constitution says they can't hold. So if you want something done do it yourselves or don't do anything and allow the GQP to take over and destroy you and everyone you love simple as that. If you can't be bothered to be asked to lift a finger to defend yourselves and those you love fuck you, you aren't part of the solution you're part of the problem.The Republican party never really had a sturdy leg to stand on in terms of policy positions, but  over the past decade or so, they've completely abandoned really any semblance of it.  They're focused almost entirely on the culture wars that they have created to stoke fear and anger and rile up their base.\n\nThey don't know how to govern.  They just want to help rich people, take rights away from women and minorities, and spread fear and hate to justify it all.So basically, a gay libertarian leaning Republican donor has issues when the conservative party starts leaning into its socially conservative base. In other news, the sky is blue.So basically he is not publicly funding themJust his companies will\nIDontBelieveYou.gifI see this as a tactic to fool the democrats and liberals and everything in between that the Republicans are weak and losing market share. I hope most don\u2019t fall for this tripe.A gay Republican is the definition of self-delusion.I don\u2019t believe him. He\u2019s a known liar. He has a ton of LLC\u2019s that can contribute to destroying the ideal of America, so he will likely do so in a way that doesn\u2019t implicate him directlyLobbying is \"legal\" bribery. Should be outlawed at every levelGood to see after causing a bank run, he can still participate in shitty \u201cprivate\u201d behavior, while publicly claiming non-participation/ no-fault. What a champion of capitalism!Doubt.One of his subsidiaries will do it instead, or he will donate to a PAC that will support those candidates anyway. He just won't do it directly.He will, he\u2019ll just launder the money betterI do not believe him.the same guy who opined that democracy is incompatible with freedom.Can\u2019t blame poor Peter he only had a supposed $50M, probably much much more in reality, tied up in probably one of the shittiest banks to ever come onto the scene hahahahhahaPeter \u201cI Support Pizzagate over anything liberal\u201d Thiel.How fun would it be to watch Senators play Survivor or Big Brother in order to get electedThis fucking guy, amirite?\n\nFirst of all, he\u2019s a gay republican.   \n\nNope, actually that\u2019s all of it.  \n\nFuck Peter Thiel.I'll believe it when I see it. Republicans aren't known for honestly.Interesting if so.  And if the reason is accurate\u2026 shit, I\u2019m agreeing with Peter Thiel? Now my brain hurts.All his money is going towards conveniently getting his money out of banks before runs occur. \n\nAnd getting transfusions of blood from young men.That's a lieI don't plan to either.Doesn't want to waste his money on a lost cause.I did nazi see that coming. We'll see if he changes his mind. (he will)Peter Thiel is a braindead, black-eyed demon and it's probably worth ignoring his quote on this. He is a great example of the Libertarian to Fascist pipeline and a better society would have marginalized the shit out of him.Suuuure.Good, candidates don\u2019t need hundreds of millions to do whatever it is to go campaign and crudsounds good to meYes\u2026yes he will. He will do it through the system he has created. He wants people to think the Republican Party isn\u2019t insane and corrupt. It still is massively broken and dangerous for our democracyHe's lying.  He'll support whomever gives him tax cuts and deregulates his businesses, and that's republicans.  Never, ever take a conservative billionaire at their word.https://www.npr.org/2023/04/26/1171937810/no-labels-arizona-ballotI'll believe it when I see itI'm sorry you mean Peter thiel, the man who literally has the blood of the young injected into him so he can live forever?\n\nYeah I totally trust what this guy says.If ever, ever, ever there was a time for a reasonable third party candidate, NOW is the time.Why did his lover mysteriously die ? Lock him up!I can guarantee he'll fund someone ultra far-left in moderate areas and intentionally try to provoke negative sentiment towards dems in general. That's the playbook for division when you have no good candidatesHe doesn\u2019t really need to\u2026 full blown dementia shouldn\u2019t be hard to beat\u2026 gonna be a priceless debate.That's ok, mayo man Kenny has been donating lots to DeSantis.Im shadowbannedI\u2019m not voting in 2024. I\u2019m tired of picking between two bad choices. Biden is losing his mind and Trump is\u2026. Trump. I\u2019m not gonna go to the poll and waist my time on a third party. I\u2019ll just sit back and watch the dumpster fire knowing I have no control over anyone but myself.He didn't get to be a Billionaire by wasting money. He has no need to donate to ensure the gop win. The democrats have done tht for him by refusing to hold a primary.It doesn\u2019t matter it looks like the Swamp has succeeded in electing whom ever they want.  Just look at some of the brain dead Senators that were selected and the current President.Count me out as wellHis carts already full?Must have bought enough senators the last voting cycle. I'm looking at you JD vanceGreat. Thanks \ud83d\udc4dYes he will.Bullshit. Nice try PeetsI do nazi this happening.sure_jan.gifHe\u2019ll wait until 2028 when JD Vance runs for president.He is busy funding grifters pretending to be left to make their audience vote RepublicanLike that\u2019s believable . He needs candidates to support his greed .*today. \n\nCheck in every day before he changes his mind for one reason or another. \n\nCan\u2019t call him a liar otherwise I think that might be libel.Let us hope this starts a trend\u201cI have done enough\u201dAlready owns them.Well thank god for small favors. \ud83d\ude44I don't blame him, The nutjobs he funded in the last election didn't do very well, so a very bad RoI.Is he posturing after the Harlen/Thomas news?Theil, Murdoch, Musk, Melania, Gorka, can all go back to their country. Those countries need them more than we do.I think he might just be changing strategy; he can go about dismantling the Democratic Party like he\u2019s done to the Republicans. Think about it: he can find a Tulsi Gabbard-like candidate who can cause chaos there.Absolute scum of the earth.Here is a crazy idea, Peter should donate to the Democrats in both the House & Senate races to protect his, his husband & their kids personal rights. Before his past money/donations to the GOP strips them all of their personal human rights!!!I guess it's easier to just fun Supreme court judgesI absolutely don\u2019t believe this.Just say \"oligarch.\"Is the vampire finally broke, or was the rampant homophobia finally \"too much to bare\"?\n\nOr is it there a pending investigation involving the supposed \"suicide\" of his last partner?I think the wives, mothers and daughters are getting to these guys. Sometimes the only people that can check them.I, too, will stop buying dumb stuff as of immediately.  Nothing but wise purchases and healthy foods from now on.How about we repeal citizens united ruling so billionaires can't control elections?Probably still smarting from the eye-watering amount of money he dropped in 2022 for very little return.*Presses 'X' to doubt.*It\u2019s becoming clear that documenting donations is optional. Cue the Kathryn Hahn wink GIF.Yea sure\u2026 which PACs does he fund again\u2026Bullshit.Well, not in the open. He certainly will have dark money and surrogates donate for himHe will probably still find Super PACs.Sure he won\u2019t.  *wink* *nod* \nThat\u2019s his signal that his Republican dogs will have to bend over and open wider, and agree to sell us all up the river more than they have been.No, Putin won't let him do that.Yeah and I don\u2019t have to work today\u2026This Nazi is lying. What a danger to American freedomVerify first - he is likely to change his mind... againWhen does his trial for murdering his lover start?His blood boy must be on vacation, rejuvenation not working well.On the other hand... could be played by Daniel Craig one day...So he's the one funding the No Labels org?This guy reeks of evil\n\nThe whole Founder's Fund mafia is evilNo one is extreme enough?LOL.  Sure he won't.Good. I wish he'd get on a rocket and fuck off to another solar system.Why the fuck is MEGADONOR a thing?  (My phone did all caps automatically which is as weird as having legal MEGADONORs in politics jgWell if Trump couldn\u2019t crash the government in one term, no point in trying a failed experiment twice. And no one else is even close to being successful at it.I predict he will fund Republicans in 2024.The damage has already been done.Yeah, I feel like another massive tax break for him is unlikely.His dark money PACs will, instead.Is he still into Sea Steading? Can he just go away to his Rapture-esque distopia and leave us alone?Thiel is a modern cryptofascist: someone who believes that an ideal society involves the domination of a fully-automated system that is to the sole benefit of a very select class of \"elites\" and that, once established, the masses become completely disposable, their obsolete, uselessly-arranged atoms only serving to divert resources away from the Ubermensch.\n\nIt's the sort of viewpoint that's more common than you'd think in places like Silicon Valley, and it's shocking to see how easily their train of thought can be pushed to casual affirmation of genocide.\n\nThiel is likely intelligent enough to see that the GOP focus on cultural issues is bad for business, and likely draws undue attention to him personally as he is gay. He'll stop publicly donating to them, but will almost certainly privately keep the spigot flowing since he still very much wants the GOP to be in power.God, I hate this assholeHe's lyin'! Chop him! Chop him!Uh huh yeah okay sure thing Pete.Won't fund them **publicly** but he'll dump untold amounts into dark money Super PACs.He won't. His companies/charities will.Not directly he won't.Directly. \ud83d\ude09Ya right, he\u2019ll just find a sneaky way to do itCould all of the megadonors please sit this one out?How does a gay billionaire rationalise donating to the GOP in the first place? Is it all about tax breaks and deregulation? Don\u2019t billionaires realise that they grew wealthy on tax payer subsidised infrastructure.Bro finally took his first hit of acid and realized what a scumbag he\u2019s been \ud83d\ude02I hope this means he is expecting them all to lose lolBullshitHe's gonna go live in a floating bunker in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.Saw a post from Kim.com on Twitter in a slanderous style about how the democrats are catering to LGBTQ. Like it was a bad thing they were appealing to a lot more people than the republicans. And that's supposed to be the democrats fault... Like.. politics is literally a popularity contest.Gotta save enough to get Tuckey a cozy spot in The Daily WireThis guy is going to end up Ex Machina\u2019d by a first-gen blood bot at his New Zealand bunker.After trump, i'm not sure i can take someone with a combover seriouslyHe won't even donate to DeSatan?  SAD !This feels like a \"leopard ate my face\" momentI believe he has already done enough damage since 2016.A case where ugly goes straight through to the bone.I think everyone just learned where the real investment for power was. :Looking at you supreme court.\n\nWhy waste time with candidatesDon\u2019t believe it.Maybe he's too busy trying to market his rich white people eugenics projects.Yeah right lolWhy announcing donations when there\u2019s always the dark money option.Isn\u2019t this the guy who literally started a bank run like a month ago?Such bullshit. Of course he'll fund candidates in 2024. And each of them more willing to be his valet than the last. He'll do it the Republican way in 2024; PACs and third party delivery.Looks like some candidates are back on the market!Yeah, sureHe looks just like Jim Breuer in this photo.  Culture war trenches will do that.***... publicly***So DeSantis will try taking his land?Oh, so now that his kids can\u2019t check out \u201cMy Two Dads and Me\u201d, he\u2019s gonna stop stirring the shit pot. WtfeThey\u2019ll take his money and then tar and feather him on his way out of townDoubtPeter Theil is the reason we never got donalds pee tape. His work on gawker by funding hill hogans suit against them limited our free speech.You can still bribe Supreme Court justices if you aren\u2019t a donor! You can also still bribe them if you are a donor\u2026. NvmThe odds that he has an SCJ in his pocket already are so good at this point. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be enough to keep him warm at night.That\u2019s because he will buy a democrat. Can\u2019t be spending money on losers.Honestly, I think people will quickly find that in modern politics there becomes a point where more money doesn\u2019t matter. People are locked into R or D regardless.No, he\u2019ll fund them in 2023, so the strings can be looser on that war-chest after\u2026 what is it 444 days before they can use a certain percentage of campaign funds for personal expenses?  I read it somewhere back in 2015-2016 because Trump was slithering out of culpability with that nugget. I remember it was like 8 years before you could fully convert and then some weird number of days before you could convert part as a stipend or some shit. Maybe I\u2019m totally wrong. I\u2019m second guessing myself now. Ugh.Yet he bought himself an Ohio senator that does nothing but inflame culture issues. Moron.Conservatism in the last few years has just been white nationalism. It\u2019s an ideology that panders to many Americans\u2019 bigoted and xenophobic impulses, their resentments and their grievances. He was ok with this before so I don't know why he suddenly got a conscience.He\u2019ll just fund pacs who will endorse or support specific candidates.Yeah rightWhy waste money if it is just going to be a blood bath in the close races where it matters? It is the first smart thing this idiot has said in 20 years.Well, the Democrats don't have SBF anymore. Seems fair.they always say this shit. they have no trust left to exploit frankly. it isn't even news at all after so many times these rich assholes told this same lie.But his superpac sure as fuck will!!He won't fund them legally.  He'll just buy them outright in other ways.Bullshit. He's plenty happy that the masses are focused on social issues while our billionaire overlords keep getting a bigger piece of the pie.That one of the hundreds of mega donors that they have.With how ugly this race is most likely going to be him not funding will be noticed on many fronts , and in the future he can demand even more return on investment for his donations. Id also wager if he does \u201cchange his mind\u201d mid race and makes a donation his demands have been agreed to by the Republican nominee.Lol, sure buddy. He'll donate anonymously and poor R idiots will feel inclined to donate more of what little money they have.He broke broke now and finally doesn\u2019t careSo for all the shit Thiel is and does he's saying he's more of an economic Republican than one who cares about the culture war du jour.\n\nIt completely tracks with what he's said in the past, but let's see him stick to this promise.I think he\u2019d like to keep the press away from the recent suspicious death of his kept boy. His husband is not happy about the situation.DoubtJust a reminder that Peter Thiel used a tax loophole to avoid paying taxes on $5 billion dollars.Oh I'm sure he'll find some underhanded, off the books way. These types can't keep their hands out of things.Wealth for the 1% has grown exponentially since 2020.  I'm sure somebody will step in.If he figured out the sunlight thing, we\u2019re doomedI get it, been too busy getting people knocked offGood for himHe's decided to cut out the middleman and give directly to Satan.Based billionaire? I'm glad the Republicans are focusing on something causing them to lose.They don't want his Woke Money, anyways...Funny how he seems to think they won\u2019t come for him and his husband eventually. His money won\u2019t protect him from the fascistsThiel is right about the issues that require attention, such as innovation and competition with China. Wouldn\u2019t it be a shame were today\u2019s Democrats top to bottom to make those their calling? JFK did that with \u201cputting a man on the moon\u2026\u201dWell nothing that can b traced back 2 him.Yes he willSo secretly then. Got it.I wish the world wouldn't have funded Thiel in the first place.he'll probably hide itBut he\u2019ll have a PAC? Or fund a PAC?Maybe he's finally having the thought that project a small amount of his megamoney isn't worth the fascism heading his way given the increasing rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community. Even \"the good ones\" are part of the out group at the end of the day.\n\nOf course, it's also telling he won't donate against them, since he can still get out easy enough.(Publicly)So what is he funding then?Well, being who he is, he's probably lying.Instead he will send $Millions to Dark Money PACS.That ROI is looking pretty slim after Blake Masters burnt all your money and JD Vance is proving that he can be a worthless investment even if he wins an electionDoesn\u2019t Peter Theil do that thing where he funds young gay lovers through a poorly disguised casting couch? I thought he was Bryan Singer\u2019s rapey homeboiBullshit.  He\u2019ll fund SuperPACs.yeah get rid of hot-button social flashpoint issues and see what's left of the GOP, real smart, thiel-- another billionaire who just *gets it*https://youtu.be/eSJ8XPnJK1oWhy, because he\u2019s confident the fix is in?It's because he's gay and he can't openly support them lol the hand the feeds is smacking those who try to bite>according to two people close to the businessman.\n\nHe\u2019s not even on record saying this and the two people are too cowardly to put their own names behind it. \n\nI don\u2019t believe this for a single second.Tax all billionaires out of all existence. They are an existential threat to us all.There should be no such thing to begin with across the parties.We will seeLol *sure*If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you.He\u2019s just gonna run a shadowy blitz of messaging or talking points.  He doesn\u2019t care who wins as long as his talking points are in the zeitgeist.Believe that when I see a dem controlled gov lolOK I don't mean to be Cole Phelps here but DoubtGuess he finally harvested enough blood to continue his research.We need to out all of these donors and have a dedicated sub and site for who they\u2019re tied to. When you click on a candidate, you should be able to see exactly who is funding them. \n\nIf something like this already exists, would love a link!My exact thoughts. No way this POS doesn't continue to fund candidates who will uphold his low tax bill and pet projects.He tried pretty hard to hide the fact that he was pushing and trying to legitimize junk science: \n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/environment/2019/01/a-science-journal-funded-by-peter-thiel-is-running-articles-dismissing-climate-change-and-evolution/\n\n> But whatever Inference\u2019s actual intentions, one thing is clear: The inclusion of demonstrably pseudoscientific writing alongside the work of highly regarded researchers puts the two on equal footing\u2014a false equivalence that gives creationism and climate denial an air of legitimacy that is not only unwarranted, but misleading to readers. \n\nGuy is a scoundrel.Also:\n\n> Peter Thiel, Republican megadonor, won't fund **candidates** in 2024Pretty much. Anyone that thinks this means he\u2019s not giving money and demands to candidates is on drugs.**Bingo**. Peter will allegedly still proudly be funding candidates using secret dark money.\"I don't know who this Theter Piel guy is, but he's fucking loaded and just giving money away.\"Yeah his business interest and lifestyle interest don\u2019t align. Zero to One bruhhis brand is probably worse than his money.\n\nHe'll probably fund some weird Republican AI bot that donates money to even crazier republicans.I mean we'll see, according to OpenSecrets he legitimately didn't give to Trump in 2020 despite his early support of Trump in 2016 being part of why he succeeded. It wouldn't be all that unprecedented for him to not give in '24Yeah he won't fund *candidates*... just the PACs and interest groups that will do the extra campaign work for the candidates.\"I didn't give any money to Republicans during 2024. I DID give $10s of millions to their personal super PACs though, because that is somehow different. Oh and don't stop me or my company's because money is speech!\"50 straight years of bigotry and bullshit is fine, but 51 is too much!The culture War stuff was originally theater to get economic Republicans elected.  That\u2019s who Thiel wants in.\n\nAfter three decades of edging, the culture war republican voters have made the GOP afraid to not actually start prioritizing the culture war in law.  That the culture war trumps economics.  Economics can be sacrificed in the service to the culture war with many Republicans now. That makes Thiel angry.The thing is, all the culture war stuff was just made up nonsense to get lower taxes on the rich and removal of worker, consumer and environmental protections. Everyone in charge knew that and the majority of the voters knew that. But the hardcore voters that got the rich those tax cuts were told it was all about abortion and \"the gays\" (which they hear as the Devil).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem with banging a drum full of nonsense for years is that you gradually get people who never got the memo that this is all nonsense and think it's all true. Similar thing happened with global warming. 1-2 decades ago, actual people in charge knew that it was real, but made noise it wasn't. But they were the only ones that the current generation heard while growing up, so they never learnt that it was all obviously made up nonsense. The cold war was also the same (it was a great game between two powers, ideology was clearly secondary, ie Yugoslavia in the early 50s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the evangelicals have caught the car with Abortion and hating gay people. They forgot that Gay people are rich too. In fact, the richest company on earth has a Gay CEO. As is Theil and some of the MAGA folk. At some point, it becomes like game of thrones and the septum. The rich aren't supposed to have these laws applied. Until they are.They\u2019ve been doing culture war stuff since at least the 80s. This is not whatsoever new.Chief funder of arsonists is surprised when fire gets out of control.He's gay, so he might be worried they would come for him eventually.\n\nProbably not though because of all the money.He\u2019s a libertarian. All he cares about is making more money, which is a huge segment of the Republican base. But the proportion of pure libertarians compared to MAGA folks has definitely shrunk over the past few years, so I\u2019m not that surprised that he\u2019s not happy with how Trump has affected the Republican strategy.he thinks the culture wars are getting in the way of profit.  he wants to screw over everyone not just the groups evangelicals hate.ThEy\u2019Re HuRtInG tHe WrOnG pEoPlELol is this the guy who wants to do an artificial island with his \u201cutopia\u201d being basically a fascist HOA but on a gigantic boat you can\u2019t escape by your own means?The guy literally wants corporations to replace the State as the supreme authority and organizing principle of World civilization. The right-wingers worried about a Soros \u201cNew World Order\u201d should worry about this guy instead.Feudalism. Rich \"Libertarians\" want to be Kings and Lords.he's not really alone either. Him and putin basically aligned interests in 2016 to bear the fruit of donald trump. A lot of the wealth gap is creating an anti-social future.[Libertarian utopia was already destroyed by bear attacks](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21534416/free-state-project-new-hampshire-libertarians-matthew-hongoltz-hetling). It doesn't work. Is libertarian billionaire utopia somehow different? Or will it just be a walled compound around the billionaire with everyone else stuck out with the bears? Shitshow indeed.What's the difference?So fascism?>Remember that Peter Thiel isn\u2019t interested in getting Republicans elected. What he wants to do is destroy faith in government in order to establish a Libertarian billionaire utopia. \n\nWhat in Sam hill are you talking about? Of course hes interested in getting republicans elected to government they are still the party that most ardently aligns with billionaire interests. \n\nI don't know Is what you Think is going on but it's very simple, and You're over complicating it. \n\nOnly 2 groups are represented in modern government, the Religious and rich.\n\nPeter tiel is just saying he doesn't care about the pop culture warfare the religious are waging inside his party.\nHe's not going to abandon his party just because he doesn't agree with a 100% Of their ideology. He's just trying to get capitalist Republicans into government not the religious ones that have broken into politics recently.\n\n>He\u2019s still working on that, it just doesn\u2019t involve donating to candidates because he has already helped turn the election process into a Shitshow.\n\nAgain refer to my simplified version. It wasn't the \" rich\" Who recently turned America's election process into a shit show, It was the religious. The religious in partnership with a very cunning self interested billionaire named Donald Trump and Co.\n\nA traditional rich candidates Performance in politics looks a lot more like a Hillary Clinton or a Michael Bloomberg. To be clear the rich don't need to do anything crazy like upend the rules of an election process. There's plenty of ways they can get what they want legitimately, they can just buy influence.\n\n>What he wants to do is destroy faith in government in order to establish a Libertarian billionaire utopia. \n\nHe already lives in this utopia. \n\nSo to recap There's only 2 groups in the United States that have political representation the rich and the religious. This comment by Peter till is just him saying he doesn't agree with others in his party. It's a lot less groundbreaking than you think.\n\n In reality he could just as easily switch sides to the dem party if the conservatives get too focused on christian issues for him. The dem party is just as much  the party of billionaires too, just with lot less Paula whites and Jeff Falwells.Billionaires in general are dangerous for society.  The extremely rich usually want to weaken governments for their short-term financial benefit, and can end up destroying countries over the long term.\n\nWhen individuals have tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, they have so much more money than the rest of us that it is actually difficult for our brains to understand. Pocket change to a billionaire is more money than nearly anyone will see over the course of their entire lives. There is no way that the state can afford to pay its public servants, including judges and political representatives, enough to keep them from being tempted by corruption when you have billionaires running around.You can report those. The sender can get banned.What is insane is that the party that he funds wants to make him illegal.[deleted]I love those Reddit cares messages. That\u2019s how I know I won an argument.> apparently Thiel is a redditor\n\nHe has a blood boy.  Dude has to be a power mod.I finally blocked RedditCares and a couple of other bots that they use to get around the fact that it gets blocked. I still get notifications that I'm getting messages from them telling me that if I want to see the message I need to unblock the user. \n\nBlocked should mean I go about my day without seeing that.It\u2019s like Musk: he has a cult of groupies who think his wealth means he\u2019s a genius who will lead the worthy to a better, more Randian future, and will tolerate no heresy against him.Receiving a RedditCares is a badge of honorSadly enough, his boyfriend 'committed suicide' after breaking up with him.That just means you must be right.He\u2019s not even maga. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about America. He wants to start his own libertarian island nation. He\u2019s closer to anarchist, philosophically, but without all the fun>edit: apparently Thiel is a redditor. I just got invited to consider suicide via RedditCares.\n\nTeh Earmth Is Healimg.Wait... I've gotten 2 of those.\n\n1 was after I mentioned in a thread about mental health, that at one point in time I had suicidal ideation and it's significantly easier to get a gun than it is to receive mental health care. (I do not currently have suicidal ideation. I hospitalized myself. I got help. I'm medicated and seeing both a psychiatrist and a therapist.\n\nThe other was apropos of nothing. I guess that was a passive aggressive move.>edit: apparently Thiel is a redditor. I just got invited to consider suicide via RedditCares.\n\nSuch a chicken shit dogwhistle from the people that need to have a long look in their hate-filled mirrors.Report the Reddit cares, the admins can take action and have for me in the past. \n\nAlso agree w you. No way this guy is keeping his money out of this.He just won't disclose it. There are enough PACs out there to give plenty of money to candidates who support their initiatives.Or he\u2019s funding  troll farms.\n\nNo receipts, cash only, no FEC reporting.Of course this scumbag watched the movie version of Minority Report and decided to create the damn Torment Nexus.\n\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/sa0eh3/dont_create_the_torment_nexus/)Yes he is. Seems everyone has already forgotten his lover who recently \u201ccommitted suicide\u201d.He's one to talk.Imagine hating yourself that much.You do realize the culture wars & their fallout don't touch people in that wealth bracket, right?3. He is attempting to exert some influence on the direction of US politics, specifically within the Republican party, by withholding or threatening to withhold funding in the 2024 elections.Or Kendall Royno, many live on after he\u2019s somewhat drained them.I've heard he keeps a harem of twinks to harvest their blood to stay young forever, people are saying. I'm just asking questions.people are saying itNah, Thiel is very much about making authoritarian states happen. The GOP is just too unstable at the moment to be of any use to him.The flaw in your logic is that you are asking Republicans to read.You are assuming that Thiel is not gaslighting us.....intending to pour money into only the Dark Money PACs where there is no accountability.LikelyYep. A lot of folks on the left, myself included, despise Biden with a passion\u2026 but he\u2019s better than any of the alternatives, so\u2026 you know. And not voting simply is not an option. You know, because of the alternatives.Wait, why?  I don't agree with his politics, I wish he hadn't helped so many right wing wannabe dictators: campaigns, but I didn't see anything in this article or even anything I've heard about him that deserves the sentence you're passing on him.  Unlike Trump, I haven't heard about him actually breaking any laws, assaulting any women, stiffing any contractors, endangering national security, attempting any coups, etc.I thought he was a US citizen. But, you are correct though it isn\u2019t recent.\n\n*He (Thiel) was made a Kiwi citizen in a private ceremony in Santa Monica in August 2011, despite officials conceding he did not live in New Zealand and did not express any intention to move here.*\n\n[https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/revealed-how-peter-thiel-got-new-zealand-citizenship/UO6WOVE5D26PAXXCDRTMUPQEW4/](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/revealed-how-peter-thiel-got-new-zealand-citizenship/UO6WOVE5D26PAXXCDRTMUPQEW4/)\n\nSo, how in the heck has he been able to be a mega donor in US elections without facing criminal charges or civil lawsuits? Aren\u2019t there laws against this? I think there are but I\u2019m not expert.the house and senate are certainly both up for grabsOk... But don't talk about \"tax cuts for the rich\", that's COMMUNISM!  \nBtw did you know TRANS PEOPLE exist?!He'll give money to super PACs, and they'll find republicans.Theil loves the GOP for the control he can have over the impact to business and money.  He was fine with the anti-gay messaging as long as he felt safe.  \n\nIts the usual - it didn't affect me - oh now it does.  He really didn't care it affect millions others.Unnamed sources familiar with his thinking have confirmed his intentions.Don't blame the \"swamp\" for shitty conservative candidates with issues the average American doesn't give a shit about lmaoNot one bit. He will fund a Super PAC that will dole out the dollars.The presidential primary race is shaping up to be bloody. Endorsing any candidate is going to create more friction than usual and everyone knows that. There aren't any good returns on investment at the national level right now.\n\nFunding the strangle hold at the state legislative level would be a much better use of his money until the GOP Thunderdome is over.I can definitely see this POS funding republican candidates not running for the presidency, but other offices that are federal and/or state level. \n\nI honestly wonder who the next batch of crazies will be in 2024. \n\nIf empty G, high school dropout BoBo, pedo gaetz, and liar santos are what the GOP offers for fresh faces, sheesh.Every Republican candidate of any significance signs Grover Norquist\u2019s euphemistically named Taxpayer Protection Pledge. Theil doesn\u2019t have to worry about that.Or maybe he just focuses on judges and school boardsI wish he'd just bite off Frodo's finger and fall into Mt. Doom already.Funding their mouthpieces like The Daily Wire is MUCH more effective than funding them directly.Imagine waking up one day and realising you're responsible for holding the whole species back. \n\nThere should be a specific 'crimes against humanity' subcategory for people that actively work to undermine humanity for personal gain.Yep. Trust nothing Thiel says. He's probably seeing the anger at his actions and trying market himself differently to undo the \"eat the climate-destroying rich assholes\" vibe he's given himself.he's responsible for Musk and Trump amongst other things.He's just using the Heartland Institute playbook.Scoundrel is reserved for Saturday morning cartoon antagonists. Thiel is a bond villain level megalomaniac, it's just his evil plots are far more banal.I don't often wish for the untimely demise of individual people, but in his case...Let's be real though...\n\n>Peter Thiel, Republican megadonor, won't fund candidates in 2024, **yet**This is the kind of guy who will make sure Leonard Leo has all the money he needs to corrupt the courts and Mitch McConnell has the slush funds heeds to make more corrupt appointments.Also:\n\n>The source who knows Thiel personally said he had cautioned that he could still support candidates who have worked for him\"There a better ways to poison the well.\"It'll go into PACs.There are a LOT of ways his money can make its way into the political arena to help Republicans.  \n  \nFor instance, look at what Elon did in the past 10 months.  \nOr what Harlan did over the last 20 years.I actually am on drugs and I don\u2019t think that.gotta go back to their roots and start discriminating against the blacks again51 is fine too you just can\u2019t do the stuff that pisses people off too much and threatens the shit he actually wants enacted.A lot of this stuff makes me immediately think of the comedian Ron White. Also Garrison as Trump doing stand up, which is a Ron White schtick.It used to be all lip service to get poor people to vote against their own interests on economic issues. Now the true believers are getting elected which is scaring donors.The thing with culture wars is if you actually **win** it, then there\u2019s nothing to fight about anymore and the issue becomes useless.  The point is to fight about it endlessly, not to win it.Roe v Wade gave the GOP their eternal war to fight. They could push any and all abortion restrictions they wanted, a judge would immediately stop enforcement. They'd appeal and lose. Then they'd rile up the voters as still needing to fight. Repeat ad nauseum.\n\nIt never really hurt them since all the pro-choice voters knew their stuff would get struck down. \n\nThey were never meant to actually overturn Roe v Wade. Now they're scrambling since it's clear that these policies won't get struck down by the courts and the voters actually do care about these rights.The Simpsons once made a joke about Fox News \"Not Racist, But #1 With Racists\". It was also pretty accurate for the GOP as a whole at the time. You can say that they were bigots for not caring about minorities and LGBT+ individuals but they weren't bigots in the sense that they had personal issues with them. They just saw using bigoted voters as a good way to get elected. However, there has been a massive shift in the party. People want to say that the Republican party hasn't been good since Lincoln is fine, but pretending that late 00s/early 10s Republican party of people like Mitt Romney and John McCain is just as bad as the current Republican party of Drumpf and Meatball Ron is just not true.Well the problem is that Republicans drummed up all the culture war stuff as a way to get bigots to support there election, while their real agenda was to service rich people, and there aren\u2019t enough rich people to vote people into office.  Now those same republicans are getting a little uncomfortable that the culture war stuff is real.\n\nSo it\u2019s like, you want tax breaks, so you promise a bunch of homophobes that if they elect your friend, you\u2019ll outlaw homosexuality and murder all the gay people.  You don\u2019t actually want that because you\u2019re gay, but it\u2019s a way of getting a bunch of stupid homophobes to vote for your friend, and you friend has promised to give you tax breaks.\n\nBut you don\u2019t realize that when your friend is spouting homophobic nonsense, he believes it.  He does intend to make homosexuality illegal.  So now you\u2019re in a tough spot.\n\nYou just intended to pander to a bunch of idiots so you could get what you want, but you didn\u2019t intend to fulfill your promises.  But those people only care about your promises, and don\u2019t care what you want.  And those people are the ones who are actually in charge.Just like in the 2016 presidential election, there were two types of Republican voters: the ones that *thought* Trump would start \"the wall\" on day one, and the ones that *knew* Trump would start tax-cuts-for-the-rich legislation on day one. \n\nWe all know who got fooled in 2016.\n\nIn 2024, there will be two types of Republican voters: the ones that *think* (R-candidate) will start persecuting \"the gays\" on day one, and the ones that *know* (R-candidate) will start tax-cuts-for-the-rich legislation on day one.REDMAP was created specifically to do what Republicans are doing: capture state houses and use that to drive people to the house, senate and presidency.\n\nTo capture statehouses, they gerrymandered them or created a insanely divisive culture that drove people either to the sidelines or to the polls to vote for the crazy culture war flags of guns, forced birth, or a miasma of conspiracy nuttery.\n\nThe republicans min-maxed the weaknesses in democracy writ large across the united states.Right, \u201cculture wars\u201d are just distractions to keep the rabble fighting amongst ourselves so we don\u2019t notice the wealthy republican donors hoarding everything of value for themselves.They tied social and fiscal conservatism together to get votes and now they are complaining that social conservatism has taken the reins over fiscal conservatism.Nixon / Goldwater - southern strategy.   Dixiecrats could be persuaded to vote republican using the right dog whistles.  States rights, individualism , patriotism etc.I'm sure the chaos of having different states with different laws, judges issuing random injunctions, businesses making decisions and/or relocating based on their social values all get in the way of his moneymaking.\n  \nKeep the lower classes hungry and working hand-to-mouth, keep taxes low and eliminate regulations, but don't cause chaos.  Those aren't the politicians he pays for.Yup. The guy wants to make the city of Rapture from Bioshock. But he would prefer it to encompass all of North America.Listen to the Behind the Bastards episode about Seasteading. My favorite part is that people on the libertarian utopia boat can\u2019t be trusted to have hot plates or microwaves in their rooms so they have to get a meal plan from the cafeteria.And when the workers rebel or the robot workers break down?\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Sure I\u2019m stuck working menial jobs for low pay right now, but it\u2019s only because of all these pesky rules and regulations. If we can get rid of those I\u2019m obviously going to rise to the top due to my inherent value as a (white) person.\u201d\n\n- Most LibertariansHe wants a cyberpunk dystopia where the highest class are essentially untouchable gods and everyone else exists to serve them.He only \"wants\" that because it supports him staying on top in a society where everybody wants what he has and he has easy levers to control the narrative so as to deliver palatable messages to the rest of us so we'll continue to support his egregious wealth and power. He'd be just as happy if all humans collectively decided to declare him god-emperor for eternity.\n\nAkin to pharaohs and kings claiming divine authority then using religion to suppress the people to stay on top. Except he wants to do it through corporations, because it's the era he was born into.\n\nHe's just another sociopath narcissist who wants to rule the world and lucked into the power to do something about it.\n\nThe vast majority of all human problems come from these exact people and our unwillingness to do something about them.I\u2019ve gotten so many and reported them and never heard back from Reddit about it.  Doubt anything ever happened, because Reddit *doesn\u2019t* actually care, ironically.How can you report them?  I\u2019ve always started to and then the form you fill out doesn\u2019t quite have options to match the situation of maliciously sending those.You can also preemptively block redditcares so you don't get the messages.Hey, Hitler tolerated Ernst Rohm (until he didn't)The GOP has turned against vampires?!?!>him\n\nHim?

The concept of it is great, when applied reasonably, the problem is most aren't reasonable.

It's \"super PACs\" that have no limit on how much they can spend, but they have a restriction that they *can't give money to candidates directly.*\n\nSo a super PAC cannot give money to a politician. Instead, they can spend money on things like advertisements that aren't sponsored by the politician. You can think of it as if the super PACs are running their own campaigns on the behalf of specific politicians, but without interacting with the politicians. Running their own campaigns in parallel to the politician, sort of.\n\nNow, super PACs are legally required to publicly disclose who has donated to them. However, the loophole here is that wealthy donors, like perhaps Peter Thiel, can give unlimited to money to company A. Company A then gives that money to the super PAC. The super PAC then discloses that company A gives them the money. The public will have no way to know who gave the money to company A, so we're in the dark and hence the term \"dark money\".\n\nJust sharing this info so people can fully understand exactly what's going on in the USA here. I doubt many people are aware that there is a difference between PACs and super PACs, or that super PACs cannot directly give money to political candidates.\n\nIf you're interested in a specific example of a super PAC, you could start with [Priorities USA Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priorities_USA_Action) who are probably still the biggest super PAC working on behalf of the Democratic party.Just was catching up on that, here's an archive of an intercept article for anyone interested.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230324011103/https://theintercept.com/2023/03/23/peter-thiel-jeff-thomas/If you are unfamiliar, Mitch McConnell actually said this about his own party leading into the last midterm election.Oh absolutely. Their privilege outweighs any marginalized identities. See Jenner, for instance with a trans bigot. \n\nBut it still surprises me a bit every time. It's just so hard for me to imagine being that selfishDing ding ding.\n\nEvery four years the part that is left unsaid\u2026\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026..until I am confident I will get the quo for my quid.\u201dOh, that\u2019s not even a \u201cpeople are saying\u201d thing - the blood boy joke in Silicon Valley was literally based off Thiel.Thats probably accurate.Ya, this isn't directly about disagreements in policy or or even their abhorrent conduct.  Its about a guy seeing the odds are not in his favor this time around and not throwing away a bunch of cash for these clowns to burn.  Publicly.Good point.Hating a person is different than actively doing harm to the country or breaking a core promise. \n\nLove him or hate him, he has done neither and is very likely to be re-elected because he\u2019s a known quantity.Who do you think financed the insurrection?Dude he runs his own private NSA and sells access to the actual NSA and probably a lot of other people.  Why?  Because it would possibly be illegal if the government did it but now they\u2019re paying someone else after the fact.Nope, thank the republicans on the Supreme Court via CitizensUnited.Also by giving them a taste of what life is like without his assistance, he can demand more in the future.> GOP Thunderdome\n\nBlunderdome more like>The presidential primary race is shaping up to be bloody. Endorsing any candidate is going to create more friction than usual and everyone knows that.\n\nIf these people were logical though they wouldn't even wonder. On one side, you have business as usual, the guy you know, who's been in politics forever and is unlikely to change many things but will bring stability and let you make your money as usual. On the other side, you have either a candidate who's turning his state into a fascist hell one unconstitutional bill at a time and is picking petty battles with corporations he doesn't like, or the most corrupt and stupid President in history, a guy who's likely to be indicted and might decide one day to renege on international trade deals because he didn't like that the Prime Minister of this or that foreign country had a nicer tie than him. Corporations love their tax cuts, but even that shouldn't be enough to play Russian roulette and endorse either De Santis or Trump.I like this term. It seems fittinghello, REDMAP? Someone realized you still exist, are still the primary goal and all this circus around the presidency while the fault, is not really the goal.>\tThunderdome is over.\n\nPretty sure Master Blaster is just dead. They\u2019ll find some other mutant cretin to fill the void soon enough.I think it will be the biggest joke of a race ever. Trump is not showing up to any debates and he's going to win the R vote by a landslide. Biden will win D primary. No real other realistic scenario unless one of them suffers health problems.I don\u2019t know how bloody it will get, Trump might just run away with it.  From Thiel\u2019s perspective why spend money if you assume the cycle will be spoiled by Biden spanking Trump again.Bloody? So far it\u2019s shaping up to be a complete blowout for Trump. He has a *massive* lead and no serious challengers.Can we also acknowledge that the next presidential race is TWO GOD DAMN YEARS AWAY! The collective stress and anxiety we feel as a society by having political stunts shoved in our faces that in theory don't matter for a few years anyway......cannot be good for humans.>\tMost importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\n\nPer Thiel in his essay \u201cEducation of a Libertarian\u201d.\n\nWhile also stating:\n\n>\tThe decade that followed \u2014 the roaring 1920s \u2014 was so strong that historians have forgotten the depression that started it. The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2014 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2014 have rendered the notion of \u201ccapitalist democracy\u201d into an oxymoron.\n\nThe 1920s saw rampant poverty (the idea that it was \u201croaring\u201d for most is as mythical as the free market as some estimates put poverty rate near 40-50%), a major resurgence of the KKK, Jim Crow and Segregation, decline in the gains labor made in the previous decades, various forms of political oppression, a shoddily regulated economy built on a house of cards that would thrust the world into the Great Depression when it collapsed, etc, but to Thiel and his \u201clibertarian\u201d buddies that was the last time to be genuinely optimistic about the politics. Such is the outlook of a piece of shit ultra wealthy white guy that desperately just wants to be in a time and world state that gives him the most power possible.I don't think he/they do that anymore.  For some reason, the Trump presidency killed any influence Grover had over Republican candidates.Their ground game is so underrated.They never realize it. They see it as preserving the past instead of ruining the future.> Imagine waking up one day and realising you're responsible for holding the whole species back.\n\nThis is the essence of conservatism, though. The conservation of the current state of things -- the reinforcing of the status quo. People like Thiel would view your realization as their inherent goal: keep things the way they are.In the show Extrapolations, it\u2019s a crime called Ecocide and sounds about right.Don\u2019t forget Zuckerberg as wellThat bastard killed Deadspin.Thiel heavily funded Blake Masters in the Arizona Senate election last year.\n\nThat's Basically A Nazi Blake Masters\n\nThiel doesn't give a FUCK if a candidate pushes culture war social issues.>Thiel is a bond villain level megalomaniac, it's just his evil plots are far more banal.\n\nThey will still destroy governments and make the world mostly unlivable if he's allowed to succeed though.Also he will say his name isn\u2019t spelt with a comma at the end and use that as a loopholeWell 2024 is still like 3 years awa-OH MY GOD>Peter Thiel, Republican megadonor, won't fund candidates in 2024, ~~yet~~ unless they stop being 100% anti-LGBTMcConnell, though, is a horse with a bad hip now \u2026.>who have worked for him\n\nThis is the problem with the whole mess, the politicians work for billionaires, but the have to convince the voters that somehow it\u2019s in their best interests too. \n\nMakes it pretty obvious why the Rs want to fuck up the election process, they\u2019re just looking to eliminate the middle man\u2026I still do. But I used to, too.I mean, that\u2019s basically what the Republicans problem is; white people are finally starting to see they too are being affected by this bullshit.  White women need miscarriage care.  White people have gay and trans kids - increasingly so.  \n\nAlso, generationally we have stopped getting more conservative as we age.  So they aren\u2019t getting those growing numbers as people get older and accumulate a little wealth (we\u2019re still getting older, just not accumulating the wealth).As if they ever stopped!And once you win you have to worry about you being the next culture war target. Fascists eat their own once they eat all the minorities. They have to have an enemy.Conservatives don't seem to understand that when they run out of enemies, they will turn on themselves. If they got their dream of a white, Christian ethnostate, they would start fighting for which brand of Christianity will reign supreme.There's also the point that 'winning' the culture war would destabilize the country and threaten to bring the whole edifice crashing down.\n\nThere might not be much of a tech or financial sector left if the yahoos get their way, which may finally have occurred to some of the less-dense big money boys.Its more like the point of it is to keep them distracted from the fact that they're pushing extremely unpopular economic and fiscal policy. \n\nWithout the culture war bullshit, they can't publicly run on anything. If they say they're going to be running on cutting corporate taxes, taking away social security benefits, privatizing all healthcare, and etc, they lose their votes. \n\nThe sadder thing is its not like the democratic party can take advantage of that because establishment democrats hate regulations just as much as republicans do lmfao.One problem is that it's a lot easier to take away people's rights than it is to build a giant stupid border wall.Here's the problem though: we're getting way too close to the candidates that **will** start rounding up \"the gays\" on day one, and the GOP know they can't do jack shit to stop it from happening.Three types of voters in 2016 \u2014 you missed the \u201cI don\u2019t care for him but I absolutely loathe Hillary, he\u2019s probably just saying that stuff to put on a show, and how bad can he really be?\u201d voters.\n\nThat \u201cHow bad can he be\u201d bloc of votes won\u2019t exist in 2024 \u2014 not for Trump and not for DeSantis. They\u2019re both very much on record about how they will govern and that they will take action on their rhetoric in spite of how blatantly illegal or unconstitutional that may be. Some moderate conservatives won\u2019t buy into that, and independents will be scared off by that as well.I\u2019d prefer FerngullySeriously, I've always gotten big Andrew Ryan vibes from him and Elonmorons who played BioShock (or saw fight club, or American Psycho, or..) and thought \"aw fuck yeah, that's awesome!!\" scare me so muchInteresting. He musta quit early and never gotten to the bit where he's beaten to death with a golf club.With many, *many*, more \"company stores\".You'll have the freedom to obey your betters!Its almost like in a society we have rules that are for the safety and wellbeing of everyone.Or when the maintenance on the boat is so high that it stops being profitable and they just file bankruptcy and let the passengers starve to death in the middle of the ocean. This is what people mean when they want to \"run government like a business\" - downsize areas that stop being profitable.Come to think of it, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever met any non-white libertariansHey now, you can't group them all together like that, that's super unfair of you! There's also the libertarians that are like \"I'm your standard Republican, but with a superiority complex. Also, I want to smoke weed and bang teenagers!\"What about the bears?So they're looking for a hereditary feudal aristocracy where any semblance of a government exists solely to protect the people lucky enough to fall out of the correct vagina. That's also why they're so insistent on eliminating estate taxes. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/12/16/132031116/a-history-of-how-we-got-from-estate-tax-to-death-tax>Reddit doesn\u2019t actually care\n\nReddit ONLY acts when negative media coverage could potentially hurt platform value. This is unsurprising as this shithole is run by an alt right dweeb who fantasizes about owning slaves:\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-richI have received confirmation that action has been taken when I reported mineI got one a few days ago (my second ever), reported it, and reddit got back to me almost immediately.  I got the impression they take it seriously.\n\nIncidentally, the comment that prompted that redditor to submit a reddit cares was me complaining about the scummy bait and switch marketing the director of the christian horror movie Nefarious openly admitted to.  I guess me quoting the directors own words was enough to offend some right wing evangelical.The form should default to \"this is targeted harassment towards me\". When it asks for a link, take the permalink of the Reddit cares message. You can write in the text box that the feature is being abused.\n\nWorks like a charm.

It's Thiel's. Full of gay neolibs and libertarians. Had the unfortunate experience of dating one briefly when I lived in SF.It's fucked up but while reading through and seeing the comments from his family - I can't help but wonder if they were paid to say or not say certain things.  Step dad emphasized that he spoke to Peter many times but won't say anything else, then his brother posts something about how he had mental health & addiction issues but the investigation isn't over?  It's unsettling.Not even the first time he's made these remarks.  Remember the \"I'm not a Witch\" Christina O'Donnell ad back in 2010?  Or the Indiana candidate Richard Mourdock who blew up his chance at a lifetime in the US Senate because he decided to claim children born of rape were God's gifts in 2012?  Or the outed pedophile Roy Moore fucking up a Republican win in *Alabama* in 2018?\n\nDemocrats have had crazy luck in the US Senate just because of Republicans who straight up shit the bed for no discernible reason in the middle of a general election run.That makes sense.I hate how right you are.Grooming the future Presidental Candidates.He\u2019s far from the only mega donorThat's a disgustingly accurate observation.Yeah, the GOP is overrun by morons, but this guy is an evil genius. No way he is just stepping back. He's merely recalibrating his approach.While also keeping his shoes cleanCan't we just get beyond Blunderdome?\n\n(Sorry to hijack your comment, this is a MST3K reference I MUST do to retain my good standing in that community)Chunderdome. It makes me sick.GOP Thunderdome - two cowards don't enter, one man leaves!He has the mind of a child!He may have to do it from a prison cell.  Not likely but possible.It's not good and it should be illegal [but](https://youtu.be/VYOjWnS4cMY)He is proof that capitalism, and capitalists, will end humanity if we don't end them first.Its unreal that someone would look to the roaring 20s and say \"TAKE ME THERE PLEASE\".  \n\nIts like asking to be sent back to Atlantis 10 years before the Atlantic ocean swallows it. Thiel doesn't see the Crash, the Depression, or the Second World War as direct results of decisions made in the 20s. He just sees *the 20s.* short term profit for private industry. Democratize the losses across time and space.I also am fascinated by his impression that welfare recipients are somehow a \"constituency\" that are \"tough\" for libertarians, as if there aren't white republican/libertarian voters on welfare.He claims to be a libertarian but he's actually an Economic Royalist. Real libertarianism is much closer to the writing of Kropotkin than any propaganda Murray Rothbard or his followers like Thiel have pushed in the US.He forgot the other name for that time. The Gilded Age.No, they see it as causing derision that allows them to push culture war narratives so they can profit off the divide both economically and politically. This enables them to push their clearly-not-fit-for-office stooges onto the culture-war-sensitived populace, pushing through legislation that entrenches their wealth and control.\n\nThiel thinks his riches and supposed intelligence make him a very special person, and he thinks he alone is smart and rich enough to push the human race forward, but he thinks it's only achievable by him leading the reigns, so he'll do anything he can (and wants) to make that vision a reality, even destroying our democratic system in the process of it stands in his way.\n\nThis is just Howard Hughes all over again.\n\nThis is why we shouldn't allow billionaires to exist. They think they are unique geniuses and very very special because they are sociopaths and also everybody treats them like they are very very special because every ody wants a slice of the pie. So they use their wealth to entrench themselves and their ideas and try to remake the world around them in their image, which they have the funding to do to various degrees.\n\nThey think the money that people spent on their products and services are implicit \"dollar votes\" for the strength of their character because they are already self-obsessed narcissists and now they see themselves as economically-validated very-special-people. And of you disagree, well who are you to them? They have all these billions of dollar-votes validating their beliefs in themselves. It's a runaway sociopath/narcissism train, and everything in their lives appears to be evidence of their supposed unique specialness. It's little different from pharaohs and kings claiming divine authority.\n\nBillionaireism is literally a mental health disorder. No sane, sound of mind person would care about and help others so little when they had so much power to do so.[removed]Joe Rogan, Alex Jones and Ben Shapiro all have close ties to him as well.I am still salty about Gawker.Exactly. There's no moon lasers, just a slow manipulation of the highest and lowest strata of society for capital-optimal misanthropy.We are WELL past the point of any of these people feeling shame because they lied, cheated or got caught with their pants down.That is probably the defense he\u2019d use for being on Epstein\u2019s list of palsPresidential primaries are less than a year away. Ads and serious polls should be starting soon.It's literally next November, 1.5 years away, and the primary voting will begin in like 8 months or so.Enjoy the next 21 months before President Floridaman makes our country a caricature of modern authoritarianism for four years.Meh, he's always played the \"but I'm the special exception\" for the most part.\n\nThere are times where he's pushed back, but he, for the most part, has been mostly okay with courting and supporting anti-lgbt politicians as long as they can give him a .000001% tax break.That\u2019s one of the issues, yes\u2026.he knows they are going to go hard right for the primary\u2026.Turtle with a cracked shell.IswydtI'm vaguely aware of studies that show increasing wealth changes people. What I'm curious about is when those studies took place and if having previously struggled in life affects the result.\n\nLike a person that grows up with an easy life, then gets rich, it's easier to see how they might not develop empathy or compassion to the same degree as someone who struggles through financial hardship and then gets rich. Is the person who struggled more like to help, since they directly know how hard it is to be poor, or less likely to help because of some \"bootstrap\" element that makes them think they worked harder to get out of that situation, so other people in that situation needs to put the work in themselves.\n\nCurrently, we have a vast majority of a generation (or multiple generations?) who have financially struggled through life. If/when we ever end up with financial control, will we be more empathetic and giving to those without, or more \"I finally got mine, why would I give it away?\"\n\nI'm really curious to see how my generation ages. I'd like to think we will be more kind and giving than those that came before, but only time will tell.> Also, generationally we have stopped getting more conservative as we age.\n\nI have a theory that this is no longer occurring because we've reduced the amount of lead in homes/buildings and gasoline.No, but they need to focus. -- Thiel, probablyDon't we allI\u2019ll go anywhere that has Robin Williams rapping.I have. They\u2019re equally idiotic.They exist, often don't directly identify with Libertarian. They are essentially market idealists. They recognize racism. But their argument tends to circle around governments being the core problem around its existence. Ultimately, they too, are oblivious to the idea that Massive Corporations would simply occupy all the roles they currently attribute to the \"government\" in a \"free market\" utopia.I know a lot of non-whites that have adopted libertarian talking pointsI have a coworker who is an immigrant from South America and she is a libertarian. She likes Ron Desantis and Joe RoganObviously, the free market will provide an answer. If the bears were an actual problem then an entrepreneurial individual would create a bear-catching business and sell their services to the affected individuals.\n\nBut the training and equipment to catch bears wouldn\u2019t exactly be cheap. So maybe he could pre-sell his services to the town. Everyone pitches in a little bit of money to get his business started.\n\nAnd bears \u2014 while being an omnipresent threat to everyone \u2014 usually only ransack one place at a time, and you can\u2019t really predict where they\u2019re going to strike. So maybe today it\u2019s Mr. Johnson\u2019s cabin, and maybe he doesn\u2019t have the $1,000 to pay to get rid of the bears so they destroy his stuff and eat all his food. But tomorrow it may be Mr. Miller\u2019s cabin, and even though he has the $1,000 to pay the bear exterminator, the bears are now well-fed and emboldened from raiding Mr. Johnson\u2019s cabin, so they\u2019re even more dangerous.\n\nSo maybe it makes more sense for everyone to pay a little bit at once for the bear catcher to just rid the town of bears once and for all. And maybe to keep him on retainer in case the bears return.\n\nThat seems like a no-brainer plan for a libertarian town to handle out of control bears.\n\nWait\u2026Reddit literally had a sub that was a known safe haven for pedophiles and they proudly allowed them to stay up.

HOW THE HELL DO THESE PEOPLE SLEEP.Right, but fundraising for elections isn't easy even in a good year. Combine that with the fact it will be harder to fleece their normal donors for money since they will be throwing it at Trump's \"legal fees\" like a drunk sorority at a strip club and at least some of his usual recipients will feel enough pressure to get the message.\n\nWhile the party as a whole might not find its checks bouncing a lot of small time republicans will notice the dip in funding, especially during the primary season when the GOP is less generous.[*jams an oily rag into peachy175's mouth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEI_udV88i4)Johnny Longtorso is proud of you.Would you like some lukewarm pork?>one fascist Nazi bitch leaves\n\nFixed thst for you.\"He got the nomination so we can't charge him, all investigations are on hold, and I'm dropping existing charges.\" -Garland probably[deleted][removed]I got banned from commenting in r/news for making a similar comment.Sounds like a libertarian, to be honest.

When my best friend and I get into fantasizing about what we'd do if we won a large lottery so much of it is about helping people. Increasing research and the expansion of human knowledge. These fucks can just sit on their piles of gold like a dragon in llore and use it to demand further sacrifices be made to them. To have so much power to do do good, relieve the suffering of others and instead use that power to fuck even more people over is basically the definition of evil.You make so many good points and frankly, this should be flagged for /r/bestof.\n\nThese culture wars we fight, while they may be genuine and substantive to some, ultimately their purpose is to keep people from realizing how stagnant their wages are, how we've just come to accept our politicians are mouthpieces for our grievances, that we don't realize how cancerous for-profit healthcare is but more than anything, these culture wars, as you point out, are to stop us from seeing the insatiable greed of these billionaires is draining prosperity from the rest of us- and is fueling the rage of those who fall prey to this culture war propaganda.Spitting absolute facts, it should be illegal to have so much wealth as a private individual. Even corporations must be reigned in, without doing so their tendency to monopolize is incredible. It's as easy as only letting them have so much of the pie, the rest of that problem sorts itself out *somehow*.Yeah, some really great points raised. If we look at Racket Bosses we see clear criminals. We can see past the custom suits, the valet service, the penthouses, and the front businesses. We see crime bosses. \n\nHowever, we're socialized not to see the same for Billionaires like Thiel. If Thiel ensures a violent Criminal is voted into office, he's not seen as a Crime Boss himself. If Thiel profits from exploitative labor practices that look alot like indentured servitude in another region, we don't see that the same way as the Crime boss that profits similarly in this region. \n\nTo be a Billionaire, you tend to operate *alot like a sociopathic Crime Boss.* They are rackets that carry a degree of prestige.All true and accurate; thank you for adding this context. I just can't be bothered to distinguish between the various strains of conservatives at this point -- it all feels like a distinction without any real difference. They all ultimately want the same thing: to retain their power, or obtain even more.Russell Brand also.\"Peter Theil changes course, pledges full monetary support to X, the winner of the republican primary in 2024\" \n\nAn AI could write the futures headlines at this point.yeah, im thinking he is just tired of risking funding the wrong candidate. He will just wait and bribe whoever wins.if you dont want the authoritarian options, get like minded people registered and out to vote.  AND vote in the primaries.>'I never thought leopards would eat MY face,' sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People's Faces PartyIykykAs someone who grew up with decently wealthy parents and then stopped communicating with them for a decade and was then \"poor\" until I got a decent job 5 years later (idk if I was actually poor so I'll put it in quotes lol), it *drastically* changed the way I look at the world. Far more than anything else ever has, anyway. Moved me faaarrr to the left. Now granted, I'm a fairly empathetic person to begin with so that probably affects things, but whatever. \n\nIdk it just made it abundantly clear to me how relative the whole human experience is. Things are so, so, SO much easier when you don't have to worry about money and all the things that come with it. When you have money and resources, it's infinitely easier to handle things simply due to the decreased mental load. Not to mention all the other ways money helps.Yup. It's looking more and more like wealth damages your brain. And the more extreme the wealth, the more extreme the damage.I saw a survey recently that showed millennials being less conservative as they age compared to Gen Z and Boomers so it's a good trend imo and gives me hope. I know i've only gotten more liberal since moving to a red state and I'm an elder millennial.  \n\nhttps://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1608746369505976323/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1608820278955749377%7Ctwgr%5E56d08584058f41e3f1b634d4341582a13917ab44%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-2896739389232910222.ampproject.net%2F2304132133000%2Fframe.html>If/when we ever end up with financial control, will we be more empathetic and giving to those without, or more \"I finally got mine, why would I give it away?\"\n\nI believe the former will be the norm. I'm 40 now and finally in a good place financially. I have no problem sharing what I have with those that need it. If that means more taxes, so be it.

I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform, but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except Donald Trump.\"It led to him financially supporting Hulk Hogan's suit against them, which was pretty much the end of Gawker.It was an open secret that he was gay before the Gawker post.Mmm I don't think that's a fair comparison. Thiel has more power than any pathetic politician. While the US is getting fascist-y, it's very different from Nazi Germany. The businessmen hold the true power in the US. Politicians mattered more in the past before corporations fully seized power.It's the [Crazification Factor](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crazification_factor)\n\n> Obama vs. Alan Keyes. Keyes was from out of state, so you can eliminate any established political base; both candidates were black, so you can factor out racism; and Keyes was plainly, obviously, completely crazy. Batshit crazy. Head-trauma crazy. But 27% of the population of Illinois voted for him.[5] They put party identification, personal prejudice, whatever ahead of rational judgement. Hell, even like 5% of Democrats voted for him. That's crazy behaviour. I think you have to assume a 27% crazification factor in any population>HOW THE HELL DO THESE PEOPLE SLEEP.\n\nHaving lots of money and power is a great sedative.During the daytime, usually in a coffin.[removed]Parker Posey: \u201cI use a wonderful, over the counter drug - 'Ultradorm'. Don't take the whole thing, just half, and you will wake up without even the tiniest hangover.\u201d>that   \n\nFixed *that* for you.>But cancer has conquered the whole organism, so obviously it's the best, and has all the best solutions. And in the end of days, when the skies are as fire, the market will scoop up the faithful and whisk them away to heaven for all time, with you stuck here.\n\n>Plus, look at ~~all the resources it's pillaged and used to coerce people into doing what it wants by making their ways of life impossible, effectively doing a genocide!~~ people it's lifted out of poverty!\n\n>Ugh, when will you filthy commies ever understand. I don't even know why I bother talking to you.\n\n-every boot lickerThe wild thing is that they feel comfortable just being around in public.This is why it pisses me off so much when people respond with braindead takes like \"wealth is zero sum\". Yeah, okay, wealth *can be* zero sum, we can create where before there was naught, but that doesn't mean that billionaires won't turn that against us as an economic weapon to make us *absolutely and abjectly fucking miserable* as they sell us \"quality of life\" goods that don't actually make anybody happier. It's really cool that we have mobile phones and the internet but that amounts to precisely nothing if every person in society fucking hates their life.\n\nOh, and also, only the *creation* of wealth is not zero sum, but the *ownership* of wealth absolutely is; either you have it or I have it. If your labor creates my wealth, there is more total wealth in the system, but you still didn't get any of it. Anybody who disagrees can just think about this scenario: we go into business together, put in *exactly* equal amounts of capital *and* labor (including literal calories and time), but when we sell the output, I claim 90% of the profit and you only get 10%. Wealth has been created for both of us, are you totally completely satisfied with that outcome, or are you gonna advocate to receive a higher proportional payout? Billionaires operate by being the 90% receiver.\n\nAnd like, I *guess* that could be fine, except knowing the unfairness of a transaction (even one where both parties profit, but one profits far more than the other) inherently makes humans unhappy. So, by nature, even if we generate more material wealth than ever before and everybody has more than even the kings of old, everybody ends up unhappy *anyway* if the assholes won't share. *We crave fairness more than we crave things.* That in my opinion is our most noble trait, and billionaires by nature antagonize against it.\n\nOh, and lastly, most billionaires aren't even in the business of wealth creation. It's far easier to transfer wealth than to create new wealth, especially when you already control all the levers of power and can economically coerce people to cooperate with your will.\n\nSo fuck billionaires, fuck their sociopathic, narcissistic behaviour, and fuck their economic coercion imposing wealth inequality and fundamentally inhuman unfairness.\n\nNO GODS, NO MASTERS!Huey Long's [Share Our Wealth plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_Our_Wealth) actually suggested something along those lines once upon a time:\n\n> *  a maximum INHERITANCE of $5 million ($100 million in 2022);\n\n> * a maximum annual INCOME of $1 million ($20 million, 2022);\n\n> * and an individual's private WEALTH/FORTUNE to $50 million ($1 billion in 2022).\n\nAnd honestly, seems super reasonable considering the man proposing it. In 1942, FDR actually proposed an even lower maximum income of $25,000 annually. He even wanted a 100% marginal tax on all income over $40,000, but that got worked down to 88%.Yup. Russel Brand even showed up to the bill maher podcast with a folder of notes to talk shit about zelenskiy and maher called him out on it.\n\nPeter Thiel is the money behind all the bigotry and insane right wing shit you see on the Internet, he is the boogeyman who bought the conspiracy theory community because he is (one of at least)the big rich guys pulling the strings behind the curtain.Gives me some hope, for sure. I hope that trend line continues as more millennials start earning more, receiving inheritances, and achieving positions of power/influence.Well shit. Disregard the DM I just sent.Wild.  I always report them and have never seen any confirmation like that.\n\nEdit: I just went back a year and reported a bunch again.  Let's see if this works now.So weird. GOP hates gays but he showers them with cash. Are taxes really worth that? Guess to himHe rich enough to pay the gay away, apparently.Yeah he didn\u2019t want to be openly gay. He was outed against his will.All because Mr. 7 of 9 couldn't get enough at home.It's not crazy, it's the purposeful manipulation of everybody by the rich. Remember when Bloomberg was literally able to just buy his way into a presidential primary! Utterly broken sysyemIt\u2019s funny you say this. It always reminds of a Ben Shapiro retort to a Malcolm Nance challenge I watched when they were on the Bill Maher show. \n\nHe said essentially, \u201cI sleep on a big pile of money\u201d when he had no answer about CRT. \n\nHe was mostly drowned out by Nance applause, and it ended up being glossed over. \n\nIt was so telling in so many ways though. It really is just more proof that right wing propaganda is just a grift for them. \n\nIt\u2019s also a sphere in which hacks like Shabibo and Bannon, and the whole staff of the daily wire, that couldn\u2019t make it in legitimate media, found a place where their hackery would be appreciated and they found the adulation they so believe they deserve.  Everyone of them has attempted and failed in Hollywood. So they made their *own* club to circle jerk each other. \n\nThe moment is around 9:07, but I\u2019m posting the whole segment because I love watching Nance own daddy\u2019s favorite daughter, Ben Shapiro. \n\nShapiro is a hack shill who will be famous for being on the wrong side of history every time.\n\nEdit: apparently something went wrong with the you tube link? Here it is again. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/dwgsbZ1MsAEAlso the whole \"non-millionaires aren't human\" and \"poor people are evil\" narrative helps.Also a great way to get sedatives of choice.Read: trying to get out of being a star player on that list of folks just in case shit DOES pop off, as conditions continue to worsen in the U.S. Frankly, if things go that south he'll have bigger things to worry about.You could argue that even ownership of wealth is not zero sum since a dollar in a regular person's pocket will be spent quickly and go through more hands while a dollar in a rich person's pocket is invested and just lying around.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_moneyWe\u2019d have to also redefine income to include stock grants. The people that are making that much annually in income are mostly pro-atheletes, musicians, actors, and entertainers.Most of the rich Republicans (outside of the True Believers) don't actually give a shit about any of the culture war bullshit. It's just a way to maintain control so they can keep siphoning money into their pockets.Gues he hasn\u2019t really payed attention to the ~~Lincoln Log~~ *Log Cabin* Republicans> the purposeful manipulation of everybody by the rich\n\nFor all the bullshit propaganda, Obama wasn't any kind of Communist.  The dude was loved by the banksters, by the telecom monopolies, by the MIC, by the industrialists.  And that goes straight back to his Illinois State Senate career.  It wasn't a mystery.\n\nBy contrast, Keyes was an End The Fed guy.  No sane rich dude actually wants to end the zero-interest state sanctioned borrow for rich dudes nor do they want to end global dollar hegemony (which only exists because we have a globally loose money supply with petroleum as a backstop).  Even as a Manipulative Rich Guy, supporting Alan Keyes is crazy behavior.That\u2019s true actually",

Or maybe they've managed to remove that video from last week of him cackling like a startled witch when confronted with his candidate status?

I had never thought about it before and hopefully it wouldn't end up mattering here, but is there technically any actual Constitutional barrier to someone being both President of the United States and governor of a specific state at the same time?Florida wants to get rid of him too.Everyone in Florida knew he was running for President when they elected him - his supporters didn't care.  \n\nCrist hammered on it the one debate DeSantis went to.Why bother passing laws if you just change them at will and then change them back.  This is what fascism looks like.  Just alter the rules for yourself.They can\u2019t remove the bigger huddle to his ability to be elected - his personality. That personality only works in the sweaty fascist armpit of Florida.Florida changing the laws so the Governor of Florida spends less time in Florida might be the most Florida thing I ever heard of.How is this not the best example of how fascist Florida is becoming?\"The law says I can't do something? Change that law!\" says every fascist, including Ronny.I got to ask; what does DeSantis have on these people?

It's kinda standard procedure when you control the legislature. Let your guy run and keep his job. And, honestly, having a President from your state generally means opportunities for money and career advancement. So even the opposition might play along. It's not like he wouldn't be replaced by a Republican.> Did they figure out a way to make him not be a war criminal who assisted in the torture of detainees at GitMo?\n\nThat's definitely not a hurdle in the Republican primary.Well stated sure spite full people love to but not so much for regular peopleOr Trump?That is by far his greatest liability, well, that and his outright fascist leanings.  \n\n\nThe Mouse has whupped his ass soundly. I doubt that there will be any recovery from this debacle.Republicans only have a platform to further enrich themselves and the corporations/lobbyists who bought them.

Forward... to yesterday!  \n[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062974/characters/nm0943978](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062974/characters/nm0943978)Yeah you\u2019d think Trump would lean on some people. Of course he doesn\u2019t deign to mix with state legislators though so while he may have worshippers he doesn\u2019t really have allies.That would be hilarious.I don't know about any Constitutional barrier, but it would lead directly to conflicts of interest: what's best for the nation *versus* what's best for your own state (for example state economic rivalries for boosting local growth).As Trump demonstrated, there are surprisingly few barriers (at least ones officially written into law) preventing someone who is of age and a natural born citizen from becoming President.I wish we could, he\u2019s ruining the state in so many ways.The kind of people who like DeSantis are scattered all across the country. I think DeSantis has a real shot, in the same way that Trump did in spite of seeming absolutely repulsive to me.Best case scenario is that they fight bitterly and do a lot of self damage to their teamNope. Jeb was Governor until 2007. He ran in the primaries for the 2016 Presidential election.The point of the law is so that they can hold the door closed on a democrat and swing the doors open wide for a republican. Like how Putin changes the rules and can suddenly be president for life.The people with the money will continue to do what they want.I think you might be missing the point of the criticism. \u201cStandard procedure\u201d or not, it\u2019s anti democratic and also just simply bad policy.It's an advantage.Srry but liberal politics are not it. \n\nWe've been thrown into a recession because of silly inflationary policy. \n\nAs home ownership costs become higher the Biden government wants responsible citizens to take on additional fees to try and convince wall street to purchase debt of lower fico scoring borrowers that represent higher default risks. \n\nHe'll be gone and we'll be in another boomer sponsored economic crisis tied to mortgage defaults. \n\nYou can keep giving your vote to the politics of failure but I'm good. \n\nI want to see effective policy not wealth transfer so more corporations can profit off poor decision makers.\n\nDemand more, demand better from the American POLITICAL SYSTEM.My exact point, demand more demand better.No conflict. He doesn't care about FL interests nowLiterally the state has taken a nose dive since he came into leadership. I'm sure he'll get rid of term limits he if loses the Presidency (which he will).Yay, let\u2019s let him ruin the country instead!I don\u2019t think he has a shot, Hillary was cancerous to the dnc, and everyone thought trump had no chance so they didn\u2019t vote.\n\nNow that Roe falling has galvanized the democrats, and pushed Republican voters to abstain couple with the enormous amount of self sabotage and infighting the GOP has committed I really don\u2019t see them taking the WH until they can rehab their image and actually make a platform.I disagree. Trump got lucky running against a unpopular democrat after a contentious Dem primary. A lot of Democrats stayed home, assuming no one was nuts enough to vote for Trump anyway.  DeSantis is essentially a boring Trump mini me. If he gets the nomination or if Trump gets it, a lot of Republicans will stay home this time on Election Day, same as they did in 2020.You got it right on the nose!Correct.It's really not. \n\n> It wouldn\u2019t be the first time lawmakers changed the state\u2019s resign-to-run law to help a candidate they liked. In 2007, as then-Gov. Charlie Crist was being considered as a running mate for Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential bid, lawmakers removed the requirement that federal candidates had to resign from their current office.\n\n> In 2018, lawmakers changed the law again, explicitly outlining the requirement for candidates running for federal office to resign and removing an exception for presidential and vice presidential candidates, saying federal candidates must resign no later than 10 days before qualifying for office.\n\nIn fact, that 2018 law was supposed to have already fixed this.\n\n> Some have interpreted that law to say that a Florida candidate running for federal office wouldn\u2019t have to resign from their current elected position as long as they\u2019re not also trying to be reelected to that position.\n\n>Those include Sen. Travis Hutson, R-Elkton, who is sponsoring SB 7050 and introduced the amendment Tuesday. Hutson wrote the current resign-to-run law in 2018.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary,\u201d Hutson said of his amendment. \u201cI think my bill (from 2018) was crystal clear.\u201d\n\nI hate DeSantis as much as the next guy but this was never gonna end any differently.>Srry but liberal politics are not it. \n>\n>We've been thrown into a recession because of silly inflationary policy. \n>\n\nNot in a recession, no matter how hard the Fed is trying to cause one with rate hikesIf you listen to conservative media, DeSantis has been the greatest governor of Florida and made it the best state.Hasn\u2019t 2016 taught us not to be so confident?I choose to believe you because I want to lol. I'll vote either way though.The fed has to raise rates to reduce the money supply after all of the printing the current government has done. PPP Loans, child tax credits, unemployment extensions, etc... All inflationary actions. \n\nGDP has contracted consecutively for two quarters. Politicans can deny it but yes we're in a recession. Ask any business owner, read the news about labor and layoffs.That's the scary party, there is reality and the alternative universe they live in!!! \n\nFor the average Floridian: home & rental prices have increased, education is failing / teachers are fleeing the state, science is no longer \"valid\" and doctors are fleeing the state, insurances have skyrocketed, good paying jobs are nowhere to be found to keep with the housing crisis, personal freedoms are being encroached by our local government, guns have no boundaries to keep out of the hands of the wrong people and climate change is going to take Florida by the balls in the next couple decades wether MAGA likes it or not. I'm sure I'm missing some....They have mastered blaming democrats for every failed policy of the republicans\n>GDP has contracted consecutively for two quarters. Politicans can deny it but yes we're in a recession. Ask any business owner, read the news about labor and layoffs.\n\nNo it hasn't, and the inflation we experienced was mostly first supply chain issues from COVID and profiteering. \n\nThe reason the Fed is still raising rates was more to do with business not liking high employment numbers. They're trying to cause a recession to raise unemployment and break worker's negotiation power.[removed]",

Republicans are now struggling to raise their voter turnout without either driving suburban fiscal conservatives away from the party for GENERATIONS or resorting to blatant (OK, with no other plausible rationale) voter suppression.There's no constitutional mechanism for a nationwide plebiscite, nor any requirement for Congress to pay any attention to the results of such. There's certainly no way to force any state to hold one.\n\nShould this sort of issue, as well as gun control, be submitted to all voters to express an opinion? Yes, but . . .

Try to fuck up everything, and then blame the Dems because things get shitty.The world economy is cautiously optimistic the US will avoid default, because causing such a catastrophic world crisis for no apparent reason would require superhuman levels of idiocy and ineptitude.\n\nThey are not properly accounting for the GOP-led House.> GOP leaders were projecting confidence. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pass it tomorrow,\u201d House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said as he headed into McCarthy\u2019s office later on Tuesday.  \n\nI remember Majority Whip Emmer saying the exact same thing after the second day of voting for Speaker of the House not 5 months ago. It's like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.I think they'll put us in default and crash the economy this time. They are reaching the end gameDoes anyone in the Republican House *really* believe that defaulting would cause a world crisis? These people aren't bright at all, but they sure are anti-American and would do anything to make America look bad and possibly start a war that they or their children wouldn't fight in.WCGW\n\nMcCarthy is gong to get royally humiliated by the pro-insurrection pro-Putin wing of the GOP, and he'll deserve it.What could possibly go right?\u201cAn essential element to get my vote for any increase in the debt limit would be enacting work requirements starting in fiscal year 2024 \u2013 NOT 2025 as the legislation is currently written,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) warned on Twitter.About the only thing that you can do is stand back and let the Republican Party continue to show their ineptitude to govern. The Democrats just need to try to be there when everything goes pear-shaped and the Republican party needs to be bailed out, once again.It\u2019ll probably be get voted down because as RINO like McCarthy doesn\u2019t have the guts to put in the real cuts we need. This is a good start but it doesn\u2019t go far enough by far.Why is it \"debt limit\" and not \"national budget\"? These politicians are pulling a scam on us. Both sides need to pull it together and negotiate a budget they are both happy with instead playing chicken with the US dollar.Every time Republicans shut down the government they get blamed for shutting down the government. This will be especially true when the ship is being steered by the utterly feckless Kevin McCarthy.\n\nIt would be a failure even more spectacular than the _last_ time they ran this stupid play. Remember when Trump had them shut down the government for a record 35 days in a tantrum over funding for his idiotic wall of racist futility, then eventually he caved, instituted a fake \"national emergency\" so he could drain money from legitimate national defense programs, only got a few miles of wall built anyway, and called it a great victory? That is the kind of adults we are dealing with again here.McCarthy couldn\u2019t manage a good shit let alone the house. What a loser.> blame the Dems because things get shitty.\n\nAnd Tucky [thinks that's really funny](https://youtu.be/Xz_u92u6eI4?t=795).Then some Dem voters fall for it, unfortunately.  They fall for the GOP tricks and GOP media.I\u2019m really hoping the holdouts are serious. The handwriting has been on the wall since Kevin obsequiously weaseled his way to speaker. And almost any Republican will have the same problem with MAGA cliffplungers.> Why is it \"debt limit\" and not \"national budget\"?\n\nBecause it's solely about the debt limit.\n\n> Both sides need to pull it together and negotiate a budget they are both happy with instead playing chicken with the US dollar.\n\nThere is a budget. It was passed at the end of last year (IIRC). Money has been earmarked for various expenses and in some cases will have been spent already.\n\nWhat's in the way now is an artificial construct that prevents the federal government from being able to pay for things that were already voted for.This isn\u2019t a \u201cboth sides\u201d things. The right needs to pass a clean debt limit increase like they do whenever a Republican is in the White House. \n\nThere should be zero negotiation with people who want to take the global economy hostage over money that was already spent.Both sides doesn't enter into this. This is solely MAGAs doing and this isn't about the budget. it's about paying our billsAlmost everyone is gullible to some extent.There's a lot of dems who take gop arguments at face value.  They refuse to understand that every word put of their mouth is a lie, meant to distract.\n\nI keep seeing articles about how such and such repub is a hypocrite, but the authors don't realize the Republicans love the hypocrisy. \n\nBeing able to do whatever in front of others, while claiming to be in support of another thing and not being called on it (or just being able to ignore being called on it) is their favorite thing to do.Yeah isn\u2019t that the truth no matter how thorough I am I still have accepted a couple stories that were bsAbsolutely.\n\nIf a Republican stands up and says \"Democrats just can't cut it!\", it will be a group of politically self-loathing Dems and Independent leaning Dems somewhere vigorously agreeing and piling on parroting ALL of the Republican talking points about the Democratic Party. They don't get how they are being used and are very ripe for misinformation and disinfo. This is why Russia and Chinese troll farms love the far right...and the far left. It has gotten to the point where Republicans don't even have to do much because too many Dems/Independent Dems have become political doomers about their own Party and by extension, their own country.\n\nI mean...the Republican Party is RIGHT THERE! Actively tearing down the country. \n\n\"But the Dems! \ud83d\ude2b\"",

It's so depressing.John Roberts will go down in history as perhaps the most worthless Chief \"Justice\". If Biden gets enough Senators after the election on board with court-packing I say do it.SCOTUS should be the vangaurd for policing any unlawful act, even if it is one of their own. They make enough to be above bribes and lobbyist influence. Not to mention, the job calls for above  board honesty and truthful decisions. Corruption has no place in the highest court of our country.Just because you preside \"over\" the law does not mean that you are \"above\" the law.Where are the checks and balances that are supposed to apply to the Supreme Court?The only question really is, does the SC have any ethics left? It seems obvious they do not, and are easily bought and captured already by their wealthy backers.It's time to stop calling it SCOTUS. Call it the ICOTUS, the Illegitimate Court of the United States.I can't imagine anything more grotesque in the grandeur than the lifestyle Qlarence & Qinni Thomas have become used to.\"Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the chief justice of the United States is exceedingly rare, as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence,\" Roberts wrote.Hillary Clinton testified under oath before Republican led committees for 12hrs!! Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration knew Republicans were just fishing and hoped to impune Clinton's reputation. She still showed up. Congress is still Congress even when people you didn't vote for are in the job. \n\nPer the United States Constitution Congress has an oversight component for the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice is disrespecting our institutions by refusing to participate. By refusing to meet with the judicial ethics committee  There is no good excuse for this!\n\nIn the future Congressional committees will be worthless if officials from the Judicial and Executive Branches can just continuously refuse to participate. Roberts isn't merely avoiding questions about Thomas. He is weakening our institutions.What's the constitutional solution to a Supreme Court gone rogue?Forget the Supreme Court\u2026let the people decide social issuesWhat are those? They are above the law.They\u2019re not questions. They\u2019re facts. They\u2019re corrupt and need to be replaced.This has Kagan or Sotomayor written all over it. Probably another rape accusation or bribery scandal uncovered in one of their pasts, right? She likes vodka, ok? She likes letting off a little steam with the girls and having a martini or four. She liked it back then and she likes it now too. She likes vodka! What\u2019s the big deal.Almost certainly. Corruption in the legislative branch one thing, corruption in the executive that's another, the judicial branch ooof. It's okay though we could rely on the legislative to clean it up. Oh wait congress will probably not be able to impeach because of party loyalty. YikesIt can lead to something. Just get most of Congress to agree on shit.What, exactly, do you think Roberts should be doing?  It's not like he has the authority to fire anyone.  Think what a disaster that would be.\n\n- He could publicly condemn one of his fellow justices, but that's not exactly going to be helpful the next time he's trying to wrangle votes.  \n- Call for ethical guidelines?  Sure, but without enforcement, it's pointless.  What's he going to do if (when) someone violates them?  Indeed, what if someone flat out says they're not going to follow them?\n\nI get that the SC is a mess, but what do you think Roberts can do that he isn't?Well, we're in an exceedingly rare set of circumstances aren't we?House impeaches, senate removal via conviction in a senate trial. Same as the President.\n\nWon\u2019t happen GOP will protect their own no matter what the crime. We\u2019ve seen that.The legislative has to clean it up that's it (impeach). The justice department could try and charge but even in the event of a conviction a supreme court justice would still be on the supreme court.Part of what's coming is SCOTUS being almost sidelined by dueling Circuit Courts.What are the chances that we\u2019ll have a dem president with dems in control of the house and the senate? Do you think this is possible? I almost think the extremism on behalf of the right is a reason why it\u2019s possible.Oh... Easy then...\n\n/s> He could publicly condemn one of his fellow justices, but that's not exactly going to be helpful the next time he's trying to wrangle votes.\n\nThis very statement right here is what he can do. If wrangling votes in what is clearly a wild court overturning long-standing precedent, engaging in clear bribery and unethical behavior is more important than at least maintaining the credibility of his court in matters of ethical concerns, then he is a cad himself which we all know and defending him isn't a good look. \"Lay with the dogs and you're likely to come away covered in fleas.\"\n\nIf Roberts had any credibility before it is long gone and he is equally as culpable for the degradation of the Supreme Court  as his fellow judges he doesn't openly condemn for unethical behaviour.For one, he could testify in front of the senate. It currently appears as if he's hiding or scared. And I think he should at *least* be privately asking Clarence Thomas to step down, that's literally the bare minimum.\n\nEdit: I'm unsure how I feel about Gorsuch at the moment (besides that he sits in a stolen seat) until more details come out, but every day Clarence Thomas remains on the Supreme Court is that much less legitimacy the institution has.He can say that Clarence Thomas's corruption is unacceptable and that he should resign or be impeached. The probability of CT resigning or being impeached goes up considerably if he does. So much of democratic change is just setting the conditions for something to happen. Also, JR doesn't need to worry about wrangling votes; CT is always going to vote which ever way benefits the conservative movement.Even if the Democrats took control of the House, Senate, and White House, they wouldn't likely have enough to impeach and remove judges - especially not a Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe two thirds vote is a double edged sword. On one hand, it makes it virtually impossible to remove a corrupt judge. On the other hand, it also means that Republicans can't remove a judge for \"being too woke.\"I didn't say easy. But it is simple. 60 senators. That's all you need.So game it out for me: Roberts goes public, saying he thinks Thomas is a crook, and should resign, be impeached, or arrested (maybe all three).\n\nWhat happens then?\n\nThomas is still a SC justice.  He still gets to rule on constitutional matter brought before the court.  And now, neither Thomas nor any of the other conservative justices will work with him.  On anything.  Indeed, it seems quite likely they'd begin actively working to thwart and undermine him at every turn (because of course they would).\n\nOther than Roberts being able to say \"Hey, I did what I felt was ethically right,\" what benefit do we get from a condemnation?  Having the chief justice call out a fellow is hardly likely to make people think *better* about the SC.Wait until we find out most of them have shady dealings.\n\nLaws are for the poors.> he could testify in front of the senate\n\nYes he could.  And what's he supposed to say when they ask him to comment on the behavior of his fellow justices?  Support them?  Speak out against them?\n\nWhatever happens, he's still going to need to work with these people.  And what little leverage he has would be utterly destroyed by any hint that he thinks there's a problem.\n\nAnd what would he get in return for losing any remaining vestige of control?  How would him testifying help... anything?\n\nIt's almost unheard of for a SC justice to testify before congress.  There's been what, 2 occasions in the history of the country, both on fairly mundane topics.  Setting the standard that the SC is at the beck and call of any congressional committee seems a dubious precedent.\n\n> every day Clarence Thomas remains on the Supreme Court\n\nI'm not arguing about that.  I just don't see what you think Roberts can do about it.\n\nI suppose he could publicly call for Thomas' retirement/impeachment.  What a train wreck that would be.  Imagine how the other conservative justices would respond.\n\nLike you, I'd like to see Roberts do more.  I just can't think what that would be.it might be easier to expand the court, it's been done 7 times before according to google.Damn, that is so fucked. I get why it shouldn\u2019t be easy to remove a judge and why that is important, but we definitely need an outlet to remove a corrupt judge. There should be rules with accountability connected to it, that includes removal.So... Impossible. Right?They need 67 to impeach, not 60.Are folks really talking like there are no federal employee rules or regulations that can be pointed to? [Oh, there is.](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/regulation-bribery-united-states) Read [the CFR.](https://www.ecfr.gov/)..if you dare. \n\nAs a prior federal employee, I've taken hours of training, part of which was anti-bribery and corruption. The guy lied on his [SF 714](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/financial-disclosure-report), a comprehensive and detailed report. The government frowns on even the question of bribery and here these guys are doing just that.\n\nWe just don't have the people with guts enough to uphold laws, rules, or regulations and Republicans at all levels are remaking this nation into their own selfish greedy image at all levels, federal, state, and local, because of that outrageous gaping hole in our judicial system.It doesn't really matter.  Even if there were some sort bipartisan consensus for a bill requiring some sort of ethics rules, in the end it still would require 67 Senators to remove a SCOTUS justice, and that's just not happening unless the party controlling the Senate also controls the White House and knows that justice would be replaced by someone who would rule the same way.\n\nThey can pass any ethics requirements they want, but in the end it's all meaningless.",

Just a little bit louder and a little bit worse.\n\nThis is truly the song that never ends.Since the 2020 election, Trump has only become more extreme, which scares off independent voters. In the meantime, Biden has passed meaningful legislation and anyone with a brain can see all the scaremongering about him making America communist was Republicans blowing smoke.a lot of scaremongers out there. Biden beat him once, i dont see whats changed since then that makes trump any more appealing this time.All Biden will have to do is play the \"Greatest Horrors\" of 2016-2020, It hasn't been long enough for people to forget.Can Trump even run for his self-admitted third term? Yeah, he never bothered to show up for his second term. Total slacker. But, now he wants a third term?it\u2019s almost like this already happened in 2020\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33I mean, voters chose between the two last time, and look at how much Republicans didn't like the results.So the gop has to beg Trump- after he has already declared - to tuck tail and withdraw. Ain't gonna happen.\n\nMore likely they may quietly participate in his political assassination- perhaps they will give the DOJ some ironclad evidence that will somehow disqualify Trump.  Clear the way for DeSantis.Like they already did.They\u2019ll claim it\u2019s stolen if they don\u2019t win\u2026. AgainIn the eyes of the new republican guard, any doctrine other than their own is illegitimate and should be dismantled, even at the cost of democracy. Their desperation knows no boundaries, and america is slipping into a state of paramilitary violence because of it.I've despised Biden ever since he was Clinton's point man in Congress during the War on Drugs, early 90s edition. \n\nThere's no way I'd ever vote for him. Fuck that guy.\n\nThe other other option is Trump, you say?\n\nOh goddammit...\n\nI won't hesitate to vote for Biden again, if he's the nominee. \n\nBut he still really sucks.Will voters get to choose or will red state legislators/sec of state make a decision for them?Yeah, all the headlines right now are about Biden's approval rating, but he hasn't even started campaigning yet to talk about what he's gotten done. Or they are saying that X% of people want someone else to run besides these two.\n\nThe only number that matters is a poll of Trump vs Biden, which everything right now has Biden over Trump by 5-10 points and again, Biden hasn't started campaigning yet. Once he is spending time talking about his record and what's gotten done, and as Trump's trials all start to get going, Biden will only get a bigger lead.\n\nWould I like a younger, more intouch President? Absolutely. But that isn't on the ballot. Honestly, youth isn't really an issue when you're combatting fascism.One candidate is an emotionally unstable fascist who attempted and failed a coup against the US government and is now a convicted criminal. The other candidate is a level-headed moderate who is old. \n\nHmmm, tough choice...They won't like them regardlessYeah, we don\u2019t want Trump again either, but that\u2019s what we\u2019d get.Which is why the Kennedy plant\u2026I am concerned about what happens if Joe suffers a catastrophic health event.\n\nWould independents back Kamala Harris?  How does Kamala poll in that kind of scenario?\n\nPlans need to be in place, ready to go.\n\nPlans for a running mate should be lined up, at least in secret.\"How many times do I have to teach you a lesson, old man!?\">As he\u00a0[announces his reelection campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/25/biden-running-president-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2), President Biden is extremely vulnerable. According to\u00a0[NBC News polling](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-poll-nearly-70-gop-voters-stand-trump-indictment-investigatio-rcna80917)\u00a0out this week, his disapproval rating is at 54 percent (just two points shy of his all-time high) while a whopping 70 percent of Americans say they don\u2019t want him to run again. With those numbers, his campaign should be politically dead-on-arrival.\n\nWhy are we doing this? Is there really an incumbency advantage when 70% of the country doesn't want you to run? The entire point of the article seems to be that the country is going to vote against Trump regardless-- so why not run someone who motivates voters a little more?If voters have to choose between Trump and Biden again we all lose.BUt wHAt AbOUt vOTeR fRAUd?If the last vote was stolen, why the fuck would he run again? When Bush had a hanging chad problem in Florida, he just gangstered himself in. Democrats realized that the rules changed, so the underlying problem had to be fixed\u2014less someone else do the same damn thing again. It was, and it didn\u2019t. \n\nYou\u2019re right, Trump. Nothings  been \u201cfixed\u201d. No reason to run and lose again. Right?\n\nSide note: should you really be able to run for president 4 terms now that we have term limits? I mean, fuck. All this winning is giving me the vapors.['About half US Democrats want Joe Biden to run again'](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12ucde2/about_half_us_democrats_want_joe_biden_to_run/)\n\n['Nearly 70 percent of Republicans support Trump's 2024 WH bid'](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12zousn/nearly_70_percent_of_republicans_support_trumps/)[There is another...](https://i.imgur.com/iT4go4T.jpeg)us liberals are so cool istg \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e\n\nedit: i\u2019m actually a democratI hope so. I\u2019ve seen a lot of posters who didn\u2019t like one specific thing Biden did and seem willing to not vote for him because one single choice he made wasn\u2019t what they wanted.  I hope there aren\u2019t a lot of people dumb enough to not vote over something like this.Honestly, I'm an independent. I voted Biden last time and I'm planning on voting Trump this time. Biden made a lot of promises that he didn't follow through on. Student loan debt being one of the biggest ones. Trump might be evil but at least he was entertaining. I'm sure he made a lot of promises that he didn't follow through on either but I wasn't aware of his platform and I probably wouldn't care about anything he was promising to begin with. At this point I'm just willing to vote to let the world burn while I eat popcorn.Seriously, Biden is the most tame Democrat they could hope for in the White House. I can\u2019t even fathom the venom had Bernie gotten elected.It only comes down to a few ten thousands of votes in a few areasI\u2019m pretty sure Biden will win, but voter\u2019s attention spans are short the immediate fear of the consequences of another Trump term will have faded and less engaged voters may feel comfortable staying at home. Also inflation hurts Biden, this could be mitigated if Republicans take most of the blame when the country defaults though.Inflation not saying Biden wont win or that he is responsible for inflation but it is really hurting a lot of people and many will desperately vote for anybody besides Biden or Trump.The first election took place during the first year of the pandemic when a sitting president was actively working to help the virus infect and kill.  That is the only reason Biden won.  Now people care about the economy and inflation which aren't helping Biden.I think you might well be right.  \n\nIf the GOP run trump he loses again.  Particularly as the GOP very foolishly allowed the wedge issue they\u2019ve been pushing for decades - abortion - to resolve in their favour.   Now a shitload of evangelical single issue republicans who held their nose and voted for the \u201cimperfect vessel\u201d don\u2019t need to hold their noses and vote trump, as they\u2019ve got the ruling they wanted. \n\nTrump has said he\u2019ll run from a jail cell, and once again he will have the full force of Russian influence on his side.  And such is the cult of his personality he will still influence voters who will sit out if they feel he\u2019s been nobbled.   \n\nSo either he needs to be fed a hamberder with extra polonium relish, or someone in the RNC needs to slip out something genuinely disqualifying about trump.  \n\nBut god knows what that is.  In that the GOP happily backs idiots, liars and sexual offenders to the hilt, what is genuinely disqualifying for trump?Of course they willYou could say that the early nineties was a long time ago and he\u2019s changed since then. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true but it\u2019s not that far fetched either. He was in the Obama Administration after all.So why does he suck? I was a kid in the 90s and I've liked what I've seen of him since his VP candidacy in 2008Right?!?  I hate that I am forced to vote for Biden or a fascist.  It\u2019s not a contest. I will never vote for fascism.Lol and who would vote for someone who is getting locked up?I'm not sure what you mean.  What does he have to do with any of this?  If he's very lucky, he may just get to the convention with a few dozen delegates.Kamala would probably run with Pete as her VP. Kamala is the biggest name after Joe thanks to being the current VP, and Pete was one of the highest performing candidates of 2020 and likely would have been 3rd or 4th overall had he not dropped out early to consolidate support around others. Pete also performs well with younger and minority demographics thanks to being young and bilingual, areas that Joe has struggled with recently.\n\nBernie might show up again to make some noise and vanish towards the end of the primary, as is tradition.>Is there really an incumbency advantage when 70% of the country doesn't want you to run?\n\nThat 70% is disingenuous. It includes Republicans. The number of Democrats who agree with that is 50%, which admittedly is still high but a lot of that sentiment is due to his age (if Democratic voters are concerned with his age they probably should have considered that in 2020 and nominated someone else, but here we are.) \n\nHistorically though when a sitting president is seriously challenged in the primary that president loses (Bush Sr, Carter, Ford.) It's moot though because no viable Democrat is going to challenge Biden. \n\nThe other problem is that if Biden chose not to run that would just be used as fodder by both Republicans and the media to frame Biden as a failed president. Again though this path was set when Biden won the primary in 2020. \n\nFWIW, I don't like Biden either but the reality is no matter what issues I have with him the alternatives are far, far worse. Just have to hope that negative partisanship (voting against the other guy) is sufficient motivation.\n\nEdit: As an aside, there are plenty of viable candidates outside the ones who ran in 2020, including a handful of effective Democratic governors. But I mean who heard of Pete Buttigieg in 2020 before he ran? Just because a politician might not have a national profile doesn't mean they're aren't any viable alternatives. But it's moot anyway. Come 2028 there will be plenty of Democratic challengers.)Because the bench is weak and running a new candidate instead of keeping the incumbent makes you look bad.\n\nBiden is a known quantity and most people, even if they're tired of him, will grudgingly vote for him over Trump. Name a viable Democratic frontrunner to take over, because it sure as hell isn't Harris or Pete or Warren or Beto or Sanders.There is simply a lack of viable alternatives. No one may be happy, and no one ever has been *happy* about Biden, but no one can voice anyone they want instead... which is a problem. \n\nI would love Whitmer to run, but she is probably not enough of a national figure to really pull in voters. Hopefully that changes by '28. Well, that, and enough boomers and antivaxxers, sorry to say it, hmm \"*recede into the emptiness of the great beyond*\" that it won't be such a nailbiter because, heaven forbid, a woman dare run again.Unfortunately no one is stepping up that has a chance i will gladly vote against Biden in the primary.not at all, we'll do just fine with Biden, like we have been.Nobody wants that.[deleted][deleted]What>  I\u2019ve seen a lot of posters who didn\u2019t like one specific thing Biden did and seem willing to not vote for him because one single choice he made wasn\u2019t what they wanted. \n\nReddit isn't real life.Honestly the worst thing he\u2019s done so far is breaking the union strike for Railroad workers. That was pretty shitty of someone trying to claim that they are the most pro union president ever and Democrats should have been on the side of the workers no matter what. I\u2019m not gonna vote for someone else because of that but I don\u2019t blame people who dislike Biden.This is the most pathetic point of view I have read all day. Voting for Trump is absolute moral bankruptcy.This is such a bad take. So, so, so bad.\n\n*Florida* ... Yup.Today's word of the day: Sociopath.Jesus fucking Christ this is the stupidest thing I've read in weeks. You're logic is this - Because the Republicans sued to stop Biden from implementing his student loan forgiveness program, you want to put more Republicans in charge. \n\nStupid is as stupid does.This is not a game.If Trump is president again, here are a few things that *will* happen:\n\nAbortion *will* be banned nationwide to some extent (6 week ban most likely)\n\nTransgendered people *will* be banned from the military (again), and denied care generally.\n\nOur democratic institutions *will* be that much more eroded.\n\nOh, and student loans would be forgiven already if it weren't for TRUMP'S judges!Just don't vote. I ran into too many aloof white guys with that whole \"it'll be funny/let the world burn\" attitude. You say that from a place of immense, temporary privilege, because when fascism supplants democracy, it won't be satisfied with culling just minorities.\n\nHoping for your country to burn is literally the most self-destructive, unpatriotic sentiment one could utter. Just leave if you hate it that much.And Floridians wonder why the rest of us mock \"Florida man\" I know, I'm from Ohio, but that's even too stupid of a take for us up here.> At this point I'm just willing to vote to let the world burn\n\nFlorida flair checks out lol. WTF happened to that state?Those areas are largely where current Republican policy moves are angering many women and independents.It comes down to an antiquated system that's been used a few times now in the past two decades to subvert the majority voice of the American people. \n\nLet's call it what it is.And don't forget the Saudis and OPEC will jack up gas prices in the run up to the election because they know that influences voters.Trump started the inflation with his tariffs, all passed along to American consumers, on damn near everything bought form Canada, China and Mexico.  93% of that was passed along to you and I, and them durn foreigners only paid 7% of the import duties.  Trump was warned he would set off an inflation, and characteristically, was sure he knew best.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know best, and personally set off the inflation.\n\nThe Democrats know this and are planning to wrap it around Republican necks.that is one thing im a little afraid of-that a bunch of dumb assholes would be like \"yeah, trump (or desantis)-is a nazi, but eggs are expensive, fuck Biden.\" While they dont realize neither of them have ANY good solution to it. But im hoping its not such a great number that it gives the republicans the election.no, thats really not the only reason he won. But it didnt hurt.People were sick of the fucking clown show and wanted a NORMAL, sane president again.the economy is the shit pile trump left in bidens hands, its not his fault.Maybe the truth will come out that he shot someone on fifth Ave\u2026oh wait.He was in the Obama admin.\n\nAnd carefully sequestered as a completely impotent VP.He drafted the laws putting an entire generation in prison with mandatory minimums for things like crack cocaine possession. Meanwhile his own son was busted for coke in the 80s and Biden used his connections to get him community service.  Biden also voted for anti abortion legislation. Basically any bill that took people's personal liberties away he had a hand in either writing or pushed for them to pass. He is a very evil and power hungry man, don't be fooled because he was vice president for a black guy.His purpose is to make the democrats look as crazy as the GOP, stir up controversy, and hurtle insults.  The whole why won't Joe debate me, the DNC is rigging it again, is a good example.>Historically though when a sitting president is seriously challenged in the primary that president loses\n\nWell what are the stats for incumbents where 50% of their own party don't want them to run? My point isn't that someone should rise up and challenge Biden now. My point is that the Democratic party should have had a plan-- there could have been, and maybe even still could be, a very natural transition supported by Biden and the party at large. A plan to use Biden as a stepping stone to a candidate with the longevity and motivation for 8 more years. But instead we're sticking with Biden despite the lack of momentum literally using the same strategy as 2020 because \"what else do we do\"-- you and me aren't supposed to be deciding that man, the apparatus of the Democratic party that recruits, vets, and develops leadership is. \n\n>The other problem is that if Biden chose not to run that would just be used as fodder by both Republicans and the media\n\nThe solution here is not to be terrified of doing things that give Republicans fodder-- they create fodder out of nothing. The solution is to create our own fodder-- a campaign that motivates people *for* something or someone. \n\nWe can all agree to vote for Biden if he's the guy, but what is he going to do to turn out the vote better than any other non-Trump candidate?>Biden is a known quantity and most people, even if they're tired of him, will grudgingly vote for him over Trump. Name a viable Democratic frontrunner to take over\n\nThe part youre not saying is what would it take for a potential Biden voter to stay home or vote Trump? If Harris, Pete, Warren, Beto, or Sanders were the nominee, would Dems really allow a fascist takeover? Maybe they would hold their noses and just vote for them-- maybe they would actually prefer those candidates and their energy and ideas. But I have a hard time seeing them staying home or turning to Trump, because the entire reason Biden has broad support is because he's not Trump. \n\nThe reality is that if any one of those people sees less than 70% of the country wishing they would not run, then they're probably worth kicking the tires. You're making Biden out to be the safe pick-- but personally I see him carrying among the highest risk of disillusionment and losing momentum. Unfortunately if I turn out to be right, people will just rush to blame stupid voters rather than holding a national party accountable for having a winning election strategy.>I would love Whitmer to run, but she is probably not enough of a national figure to really pull in voters.\n\nThat's just self defeating. Biden left a lot of votes on the table too, and as the article points out we know hes not popular. Why would you take it for granted that Whitmer wouldn't pull in voters? So many people are voting for Biden because he's not Trump. Whitmer is also not Trump. What specifically about Whitmer do you think would make Biden voters not turn out or switch to Trump?That's really not how it works. This is the highest office involving national political parties and billions of dollars. We're not just sitting here waiting for someone to \"step up\". A transition strategy should be part of the plan-- the party should be recruiting, investing in, building up leadership among its ranks. \n\nDo you remember how big a deal it was when Joe picked Kamala as VP? It wasn't a normal VP pick because the very widely held assumption was that this would be the person to take over where he left off in 2024 once the present danger of 2020 was out of the way. Are we really saying that if they ran Kamala, she wouldn't do as well or better than Biden, who 70% of the nation doesn't want to run, against Trump? Is she just not \"ready\"? If that's really true then it's a party failure, and there should have been some idea of where else to turn, other than depending on Republicans to be terrifying fascists again.Having a president that takes the job seriously after.... the other guy.... brings a sense of stability and calmness that I think voters appreciate.And that probably includes both of the candidates themselves.[People can change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvIA1GwW9Hg)Depends on how extreme Cheney is, but I'd vote for it if people get to live their lives like normalWe all need to. The executive shouldn't be in any party right now.12You should be blaming that on the GOP though as they are the ones that withheld the last item the unions wanted.  Biden continued to work with the unions and helped some of them reach an agreement on it even after the vote.  Allowing that strike wouldn't have been good for anyone so it simply could not happen. It would have wrecked the entire economy.\n\nThis is misguided at best to try to blame Biden on it.  But yeah this is the kind of thing that I worry about.  Same with the Willow project which got misconstrued in the press and people seem to think Biden could have stopped the project which he couldn't.  He just worked out a much better deal instead of putting it in the hands of the courts.Yeah okay. That wasn't really basing my decision on morals. So I guess that's accurateThat mindset is how Florida became Florida.>Florida  \n>  \n> ... Yup.\n\nor RussiaI'm just as annoyed by this person as you areGood, because it's not very funOkay let me go ahead and address those points one by one\n\nI haven't gotten laid in like 3 years and I have a vasectomy so an abortion band does not affect me.\n\nDon't really care what the military does as long as they're not pointing guns at me. Although I admit that really sucks for trans service members. Honestly, I hope they can find the affirming care they need.\n\nI feel like the institutions are falling apart regardless of who's in charge. My line of thinking is, the faster it burns to the ground, the faster we can start building something better on the ashes.\n\nAnd if they really wanted student loan debts to be forgiven, Biden had the home team advantage in the house and the Senate for a whole 2 years. Why couldn't anything get passed into law instead of trying to do executive orders? He talked a big game but I don't think he had any intention of following through.Gas won't be 10 dollars a gallon and I may be able to afford a house*I'm not white though. I'm Thai/Vietnamese.They\u2019re also areas where republicans are employing extremely effective gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics.might be giving democrats too much creditBiden left those Tariffs in place.Yup lots of voters vote completely on how they are currently doing financially. The reality is presidents do not have that much control over the economy but they get blamed anyways.Well quite.  \n\nHe\u2019s a firebrand Republican that calls people RINOs\u2026 and was a registered dem for years and went to Chelsea Clinton\u2019s wedding\n\nHe\u2019s the guardian of moral values who\u2026 is thrice married, boasts of grabbing \u2018em by the pussy and barging into dressing rooms full of naked underage girls.\n\nHe\u2019s the most staunch defender of gun rights who said\u2026 \u201ctake the guns first, go through due process second\u201d\n\nHe has amazing people skills, and only hires the very best people\u2026.  Many, many of whom have been convicted of offences.\n\nHe says \u201conly mobsters plead the fifth, but\u2026.. pleads the fifth when he is actually on the witness stand.\n\nI could go on all day.  Politics is sport in the US.   Some people just like the red team and there ain\u2019t a thing you can say to change their minds.Biden was more visible with Obama than whatshername is now.I'm 52 years old and have been politically engaged from a young age, and I cannot remember a single case of a sitting president participating in a primary debate. The Democratic party not sponsoring any debates this year is in no way unusual. I don't believe Carter debated Ted Kennedy back in 1980, and I'm almost positive it hasn't happened since then.   \n\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Mary Anne Williamson and Robert Kennedy Jr. should just sit down and quit whining. It's like they want participation trophies or something.I don't disagree with any of this and I was hoping this is what would have happened to begin with - Biden as a bridge to a more dynamic candidate.\n\nApologies for misconstruing your original point.\n\nEdit: \n>The solution here is not to be terrified of doing things that give Republicans fodder\n\nJust wanted to respond to this - it isn't Republicans that's the problem, rather it's the media penchant for amplifying GOP talking points (and Democratic inability to effectively respond. Might be an issue with leadership though as younger Dems don't seem to have that issue.)Regardless of anything else, Biden is well-known and has been involved in the government for decades. He was VP under Obama, he even featured in Parks and Rec, which creates awareness even among the more politically braindead.\n\nOnly people who follow politics will know much about Whitmer. Name recognition has value and cache. I mean, McConnell is not liked by anyone in Kentucky but has been voted in for decades because he is an established name. Trump coming in with multiple endorsements puts him on better than expected footing nationally. I don't honestly believe a lot of swing voters will vote for an unknown over a known quantity so long as at least some of his policy positions align with theirs.\n\nEdit to add link about McConnell unpopularity vs incumbency advatange: \n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1203211/favorability-mitch-mcconnell-us-adults/#:\\~:text=In%20a%20survey%20of%20U.S.,of%20the%20Senate%20Minority%20Leader.VERY much so.\n\nIt is nice to have a president I can ignore without worrying every single day he's going to cause WW3 with a tweet.> Depends on how extreme Cheney is\n\nCheney campaigned on Democrats aborting babies AFTER they were born.  She's every bit the whackjob that the rest of the GOP is but would prefer we funnel money to oligarchs and bomb brown people in the Middle East rather than the current GOP plan of \"funnel money to oligarchs and kill brown people at home\".Which people?What were some of the last items the Unions wanted and the GOP blocked?Just curious why you say he didn\u2019t follow through on student loans given they did exactly that but were blocked due to Republican lead lawsuits which hasn\u2019t yet been decided by the Supreme Court.Trump ran on making Mexico build the wall, and then tried to take money from the military and other programs, and never filled his one big promise.\n\nBiden has already put through the infrastructure bill he promised. He's even been continuing to fight for student loan forgiveness despite numerous delays caused by overly litigious Republicans\u201cDoesn\u2019t personally affect me, so fuck everyone else\u201d \n\n\ud83d\ude44Ahh are you also part of \"walk away\" or whatever it was called. No one is buying any of this, go to bed you have school in the morning.>I haven't gotten laid in like 3 years\n\nNo surprise there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Honestly, I hope they can find the affirming care they need.\n\nYet you plan to vote for the party aggressively fighting against them getting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why couldn't anything get passed into law instead of trying to do executive orders?\n\nBecause he tried and was blocked. Personally I don't agree with that effort in the first place, but to say he didn't try is categorically stupid. And executive orders isn't how that's supposed to work.\"An abortion ban doesn't affect ME\"\n\nOnly one party speaks like this, I'd be willing to bet money you didn't vote for Biden>I haven't gotten laid in like 3 years\n\nThis explains a lot\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I admit that really sucks for trans service members\n\nGender treatments are getting banned by republicans in multiple parts of the country, it's not just service members, it's civilians. If you gave half a shit about trans people, you'd obviously know this. and wouldn't be toying around with the idea of voting for people making that shit illegal3 years... Maybe try talking first. It's not that hard to make a connection if you try.So you\u2019re saying it\u2019s all about you?[deleted]Okay, doesn't change anything. You're definitely not helping yourself with this level of sociopathy.In every Biden-won swing state but Georgia and sort of WI (we'll see how their liberal SC handles things) Democrats have control over how elections are oversaw either through the SOS or legislature, if anything there will be less voter suppression in these states now after 2022friend of mine, he happened to be unemployed unddr Obama, but his business got better under trump, hes convinced trump fixed the economy. He doesnt realize his success being under trumps admin was a coincidence, and due to his hard work, only.Or guy that needs mommy's permission was after him.I don't disagree but the whole DNC rigged the primary has been a winning play for the GOP.  They just need to keep a few people home and they win.  And this is the kind of thing that keeps a few people home.  For example my parents were bitching about super delegates in 2020.What you say describes some successful candidates, but not all of them. Clinton and Obama were relative unknowns in their first terms. Name recognition goes a long way-- but it's also something that the party could specifically be trying to boost. My whole point is the partys entire purpose is to identify leadership, recruit, vet, promote, and develop it. \n\nThe choice of Kamala was critical because it was the opportunity to set up a successor.  If she just doesn't work for whatever reason, they could have used this entire administration to boost another name. This isn't some big secret-- big names generally become big names with the support and eventually direction of the party. \n\nBut it's not necessary to win an election on any level-- especially now at a time of such polarization. Literally every argument to vote for Biden would apply to any other Democrat-- I genuinely don't think name recognition makes the difference between \"the Democrat\" and \"the MAGA candidate\"-- and the article in the OP seems to indicate that most independent \"swing\" voters align with opposing MAGA as well.>Cheney campaigned on Democrats aborting babies AFTER they were born. \n\nI was aborted *on my birthday* and am still a little peeved about it\u2026Everyone, cause trans people existing and having health care doesn't stop phobics from living how they wantThe biggest thing was paid sick leave.  Biden put it up for a separate vote to congress but the GOP blocked it because they said they would not pass anything that included that.Because he\u2019s a moron who does no research. He actually said that he\u2019s not voting for Biden because he didn\u2019t follow through on \u201cpromises\u201d, but that Trump probably did the same thing he just wasn\u2019t aware of his platform and at least he was \u201centertaining\u201d so he has his vote.  \n\nThis is somebody we don\u2019t need to care about or listen to.They\u2019ve already said their vote is basically intended as entertainment. Not voting at all would be better than intentionally choosing a candidate whose aim is to bring misery and authoritarianism to the country, but hey, their vote is theirs to make. Who are we to attempt to stop the downfall of American democracy by such selfish voters?I don't know what that is. And if I showed up to a school at 35, I'm pretty sure I'd get arrested. Or I'd be getting like a college degree or something. I guess that's also an option but I haven't been to a school in like...going on 15 years now I think. I'm way too lazy for that.\n\nEDIT: Because I realize people are going to ask \"well if you're not in school, why do you want student loans forgiven\"? I got an associate's degree and did a couple other classes. I never really finished up any kind of degree because of aforementioned laziness but I'm never going to use any of what I was taught, I feel like I got scammed into taking out the loan and going all those years ago. I would just really like it to stop following me.Believe what you want, man. I voted Biden. He wasn't my first choice, but the DNC wasn't willing to put Bernie up to the plate for the last two elections, so I took what I could get.If I'm being honest, it's not that I can't make the connections. Most of my friends are female. Some of them are exes that I still maintain a friendship with. I just don't think I'm really good at relationships. \n\nMy last ex strung me along for \"medical bills\" that ended up just being tattoos and piercings. The sad thing is, I would have gladly just paid for tattoos and piercings. She didn't have to lie to me. I called her out on it and once she was caught, she just ghosted me.\n\nThe problem is I have terrible taste in women and I'm also not a very good judge of character. I can respect her grift. She got me real good and I was incredibly gullible. I can't trust myself to make good decisions there, so I just decided I'm better off on my own.Most people don't agree with me. But that's the thing about people, they're all different. Also, I've grown to be kind of a dick so I would hope most people aren't me. \n\nThat being said, a lot of people in the world try to conform to each other and their groups, it's part of how we build societies through shared goals and common values. I think that's natural and built into the way our species has survived over the course of our existence. \n\nI'm somewhat antisocial so I don't have a tribe. My values are all over the place and I don't apologize for them or plan on changing them to fit in. Even before I was jaded, I was not really the type to go out much. I branched out in my '20s, but now that I'm in my '30s, I isolate like like I did as teenager. I'm just more bitter now and less hormonal.It legit took me a good four almost five minutes to figure out you were talking about Pence.So having to just deal with those injustices in our everyday lives is \"normal\"?There are countries that are burning to ashes you are free to move there if that is what you think is entertaining, but I hope you don't and I hope you look around and see that we live in an amazing country full of potential. I have a vested interest in saving this country. I'm sorry that your 35 \"lazy\" years as you say in this country make you want to burn it to the ground. I'm fighting for it to be the best it can, sometimes our bodies or our relationships or our countries go through tough times, we shouldn't give up on them we should fight for them. There is a clear cancer in our society and the answer is not to sit back and see if it wins. I don't know you and I don't know what happened in your life to make you quit on everyone else but a lot of us still care deeply about others, many of which barely have a voice in any of this. So maybe sleep on it, wake up and realize you aren't being bombed liked Ukraine or sent to work camps like China or being thrown in prison for calling a war a war like in Russia and say hey this country is pretty great maybe I shouldn't laugh and do nothing as it falls into fascism. Or feel free to argue why women shouldn't control their own bodies, trans people should be arrested for living their lives, and children shouldn't be able to read anything not approved by right wing Christianity, because voting for the GOP is directly supporting these ideas. Either one would at least let me know who you are a little better.As a fellow independent the \"Me, Me, Me,\" thinking isn't consistent.  So you filled out the wrong bubble on your last ballot by accident....that doesn't make you an independentI think you should tell more women you dont want them to have the right to an abortion, that'll surely get you laidWell we haven't got the mind control down yet, and our existing laws don't let us round them up.I suppose it's all a matter of perspective, man. If cancer kills you, the cancer also dies. Cancer never really wins. It always ends in a draw. But serious talk, I totally realize it could be a lot worse. Lot of worst countries to live in. I'm just so sick of everything that's going on. Admittedly I'm kind of apathetic to problems that don't really affect me. That's a personal defect to my personality. Wasn't always like that but that's kind of where I am now. I'm neutral on the abortion thing. I don't really care one way or the other but I agree with you that trans people shouldn't be arrested for living out their lives. I just want people to be left alone. And being a Florida resident, I'm well aware of the book bans and I don't really approve of it. But then again, I don't really have any kids in school so... While I don't like it, it's not a hill I'm really willing to die on. While I'm also discussing shit going down here in Florida, I'm also not a fan of this weird tit for tat going on with the governor and Disney. I don't think a huge corporation like Disney really needed special governance over the area but I didn't like the governor stripping it from them as a retaliatory thing. Seems petty and authoritarian.What makes me an independent is that I didn't choose a party. I don't vote in the primaries. I don't really like either party. I'm not religious or fiscally conservative so I don't really fit in with the Republicans. But the Democrats seem too scared to run candidates that are really looking to make any real changes.  So I get to vote between corporate backed redneck religious nuts and corporate backed liars who tell me some of the things I want to hear and then never follow through.\n\nI've tried voting for the people that give me promises that I like. I'm thinking it's time to switch sides. Not because I like the other side but because I'm just kind of hoping it collapses in on itself. Don't get me wrong. I don't think the Republicans will make anything better. My voting for them would be  a \"fuck it. Maybe we can start over once it's all destroyed\" voteYeah me and my best friend get into it a lot when I bring it up. She doesn't like my, \"well, it doesn't affect me\" attitude. And tells me \"It does affect you because you know and care about women in your life. What if me or my daughter needed an abortion at some point?\" and while I feel for them to an extent, it just doesn't affect me though. I'm not really trying to date her anymore. We had our time and it didn't really work out for more than a few months. \n\n\nBy all means, she can advocate for it. I'm not anti-abortion or anything. I just don't care. I think it's all right to not have opinion on some things. I don't have an opinion on a lot of things, especially things I'm not really educated on. And I'm not educated on much. There are a couple things that even I'm knowledgeable about and still don't really care much.Okay, but a rational, realistic answer on the topic would be......>Admittedly I'm kind of apathetic to problems that don't really affect me\n\nThat means that you are a p.o.s.\n\nLearn some empathyI don't know what you want beyond \"they stop making laws targeting the LGBT, and reverse the ones they've already made so that people can live their lives they way they want\"\n\nIt's not complicated or a trick, people just get to trans themselves if they want to, and nobody tries to put them in prison or destroy their lives over it.\n\nLike if the government would focus on governance that'd be great, we have about 40 hair on fire crises that need attention, and we're here talking about some girl's penis.\n\nI also don't think \"everyone\" is particularly ambiguous, Americans of every race, sexuality, and gender that haven't hurt anyone. (To jail with anyone that has)Yeah, I'm okay with that. I'll admit that empathy is not nor has it ever been my strong suit. I exercised it a little more in my '20s back when I was a bit more self-conscious and worried about how other people viewed me. Now that I'm in my '30s though, I just don't give a shit. You can think I'm a P.O.S.\n\nHere's the thing, I don't know you. Why would I care if you don't think I'm a good person? There are plenty of people I know that don't think I'm a good person and for some reason still hang around so... I don't think being empathetic or caring is mandatory. It's been my experience that as long as you're there for people when they need a favor called in, they're willing to overlook a lot of stuff. I'm just doing me. I'll let people do them and if they want to hang around or leave, that's on them.See, now we're getting somewhere and I 100% agree with those ideas, however how is Liz Cheney, stalwart Republican of a stalwart Republican family, going to make any of that better?You aren't \"Letting people do them\" when you put people in power that actively try to strip away rights from people. Because you are a little bit bored\n\nIf you are so *above it all* and don't care, why even bother voting at all? Let the people who actually give a shit and care about people handle it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, if you just want to be an asshole, fine, do whatever you want. I don't expect anyone on the internet to have their opinions drastically swayed one way or the other.\n\nThe reason I'm calling you a POS isn't to hurt your feelings, or to make you change your mind, or to make you into a loving person. I'm doing it because calling people out for being assholes is the right thing to do.The word \"if\" means something you knowThat's fair, dude. You calls it how you sees it.Yes I do.  It's something along the lines of \"berry and nuts, then no one would ever go hungry.\" \n\nPlayful optimism died in 2016 (of not the turn of the century). The reality is there is no \"if\" anymore, just theater and the reality that comes from it.  And the more people go out there and say stuff like \"If she's cool..\" hurts any chance of anyone having normality to their lives, far more than it helps.Look, I do understand being apathetic towards our system. And most of the time I feel pretty hopeless about it too. I get it\n\nThere's a lot of shit that just seems to be getting worse and worse. and the \"fuck it\" option sounds more appealing every damn day\n\nGiving up and taking the easy way isn't going to help anyone. If that's not your goal that's fine, but I'd hate to think that I actively made innocent people's lives worse because *I* decided to burn everything down through not giving a fuck anymoreIt sounds like you get where I'm coming from, and have chosen to be a better person than me. Good on you, man. Seriously. I don't know how people can see the state of the world and continue to care.It's not easy, but nothing ever worth doing is",

What happens if someone breaks it? Impeachment. Oh\u2026The rub with Thomas is the deliberateness of his bullshit. Thomas has previously disclosed his lavish vacations. After a story was run in the media about it he stopped reporting. Not just stopped reporting but did performative counter media of his own where he claimed to be humble and enjoy the simple life. Claimed he preferred road trips through rural America in a RV sleeping in Walmart parking lots. \n\nThomas deliberately hid the lavish vacations and purposefully misled the public. Thomas has written over 20 books, participated in Documentaries, given interviews etc. Repeatedly describing his love for vacationing in rural Walmart parking lots. Meanwhile the whole type he was flying is private jets to exotic locations to board luxury yachts. \n\nThomas willfully concealed the truth and cultivated a false narrative for decades.Honestly none of the conservative justices can contribute anything useful in the ethics department. They\u2019re more on an example of what not to do.BRIBERY! It is not just an ethics violation that Thomas and Gorsuch engaged in.Yeah, we\u2019ll see.Bullshit. Durbin hasn't even spoken to Feinstein since she's been in the hospital and has already spoken out against forcing her to resign. Fight a battle you can actually win first, get her ass out of there and replaced, then we can talk somehow trying to convince the SCOTUS they aren't above reproach.Whenever I see a picture of Clarence Thomas sitting in his robe, his slightly closed shifty looking eyes follow me around.[deleted]I didn\u2019t know you could just refuse.  Why would you refuse?The right won\u2019t let anything of substance happen on this issue because they won\u2019t want a judge replaced. Feinstein being mia doesn\u2019t help the situation either.They\u2019re not going to do anything. Without Feinstein they can\u2019t even get anything out of committee. They can\u2019t subpoena either.Oh so we\u2019re just lying now? Here\u2019s how this is going to look. \n\nSenate judiciary has a bill for SCOTUS ethics\n\nKevin McCarthy doesn\u2019t bring it to the floor\n\nBill gets shelved\n\nIf Dems sweep in 2024 it can come out again\n\nIt passes, gets signed.\n\nAnd it is unenforceable and will result in no removals of arrests or even investigations by the DOJ.But can they do it with or without Feinstein?Im sure Feinstein is already on this..Actually, one Senator promised the hearing would \u201cproceed\u201d which means nothing.  They won\u2019t be able to make any meaningful changes in a closely divided Senate, so title of article is optimistically misleading.As a federal employee I can\u2019t accept a free $30 meal at a conference or any swag over $25 from any vendor. It should be the same for the Supreme Court and congress.Roberts has no control of this court.I can tell you exactly how this will end. Even if passed, it will go to the Supreme Court, and they will rule that this requires a Constitutional Amendment, not a bill from Congress.Oh golly gosh, not a senate hearing! Surely Scotus is terrified. No shit Roberts ignored them.Just to let you know. The rest of the first word has a term for politicized Judges. The word is \u201ccorruption \u201c. \n\nCanada had 8 out of 9 Supreme Court Judges nominated by Victor Orban fan Conservative Stephen Harper and Canada got precisely 0 weird political decisions.  \n\nThat\u2019s what happens when judges care more about the law than naked politics.They need the house tho\u2026Well unfortunately nothing can be done without Feinstein. So nothing will get done.This is sounding like the words of the declaration of Independence need to be read to everyone in government with a reminder that there were reasons America was started and it stemmed from political corruption and abuse of the people by a government that did not represent the people.I believe that I've heard a saying that's applicable here... \"absolute power corrupts absolutely\"The Court is not taking their ethics, reputation or credibility seriously. So, someone else has to.\u201cTestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare, as one might expect in light of separations of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence,\"\n\nI believe Roberts is deceiving himself as applies to a number of the judges on the Supreme Court preserving judicial independence.  \n\nWhen judges attend political sponsored events, accept gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, don\u2019t report income earned by their spouse and fail to report property sales at all or don\u2019t document the parties involved in the purchase that horse left the barn and is already in the next county.Uh huh.  They're going to make a bunch of very public noise about this now that it's in the news, and then when it dies down, they're going to mumble something about how their hands are tied and just forget about it.  Like everything else we ask them to do.\n\nWe need a constitutional amendment to fix this.  But that requires work on their part, and is a long term process, so it won't happen.What are the chances that they try to legislate something ends up going before the scotus?In before we hear about how Clarence Thomas is totally 'voluntarily' stepping down in the supreme courts attempt to throw him under the bus and act like it was all him. \n\nCan just see it happening because: \n\n1. As republicans they love opportunities to fuck over black people\n2. He's responsible for damn near all the bad press that has led to them being at risk of losing their unbridled power over the US now that people are screaming for ethics reform in the supreme court.Too late what about the crimes they already committed. It\u2019s way past ethics. These civil servants took bribes. That is a crime. These are employees of the people not king and queens. They should be in jail.Nah, it\u2019s not gonna happen. I now understand that power corrupts people and no amount of pressure from \u201cwe the people\u201d is going to change those entitled elitists. \nIt will become another dog and pony show with  a poor outcome. \nHope has died and I no longer believe we are a healthy republic with a system of checks and balances between the branches of government.It won\u2019t have any teeth.Did John Robert\u2019s give a reason for declining?Roberts, will retaliate, Kavanaugh, told us, he himself will, after his \u201ci like beer\u201d statement, you know, when he was seething madRoberts: \"You establishing a code of ethics on us unsettles our constitution. Not the actual Constitution but just our general sense of well being.\"I can't believe the stance of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the US is, \"you can't stop us from being corrupt, that is unconstitutional.\"\n\nNo one is forcing you to be Chief Justice of the SCOTUS, sir. If you don't like doing the job the right way no one is forcing you to do the job, but you will be forced to follow the rules if you stay in the position. All litigation about these fuckers and cops are operating on the presumption that they have the right to that position and that right supercedes oversight. As if no one else can do the job, let alone do it better. Send a letter to Roberts demanding he put into the record each time one of his Associate Judges has a conflict of interest with the case before them and demand the implicated judges recuse. If they don't, the case gets put off until the next Supreme Court session where the same thing will be done until there is a recusal or the implicated supreme court justice is no longer in the court.Can they do this with or without Feinstein?Meaningless without the House and we all know any reform won't pass MAgA land.That\u2019s kind of the long term rub here. Congress can pass whatever ethics laws it wants for all federal employees but they can\u2019t actually remove federal judges or justices without going through the impeachment process so these Congressionally mandated ethics rules would probably have little teeth. They might be able to use them as guides for future Impeachment motions, for instance, saying by law if certain ethical violations come up then the House automatically has to start corresponding Impeachment proceedings, but the underlying mechanism of requiring reaching the vote caps in the House and then Senate would still be mandated. \n\nNow hypothetically Congress could amend the Constitution to put judicial ethics directly into it which would give them actual force. But of course amending the Constitution with politically divided chambers is never going to happen as a practical matter. In theory though it is possible if down the road some supermajority Congress got fed up enough with SCOTUS to go that route.If you cannot provide a justification for the action then you will be the example of why is it against the law.And Kavanaugh. Who paid his debts off?Sigh.   One can dream. \n\nI'm sick of the self centered ego based bs that has become Feinstein.McConnell has stated publicly that they would refuse to seat her replacement.   She\u2019s probably resting up for those hearings because her attending is the only way her vote can be counted if they don\u2019t seat her replacement.> Why are we not subpoenaing these people?\n\nWhat body is the highest authority in determining whether a Congressional subpoena is valid?Not happening cause there's a Dem in the Whitehouse.And that's when we start ignoring their rulings.Constitution like the d&d stat. Not, you know, the piece of paper we wipe both *our* asses and *your* tears with\u2026 (wiping, of course, in that order)\u2026To offend John Roberts is to offend the Constitution, per John Roberts.There wasn't an ethics code in 1776 so.... nope.... and Manchin.  That MOFO cannot be relied upon.  this is just the kind of lube that he would use to screw his party with again.The House.  That's the real roadblockWithout her the JC is not going to be able to pass anything. 9-9 deadlock.I think it would take some huge blatant disregard for rules before the two parties would jointly amend the Constitution. We're talking blatant bribery from all the Justices in active cases. Clear text, in the public, \"whoever pays the most wins the SCOTUS decision\". Even then, I'm not sure we as a country could pull our heads out of our asses enough to get that done.A government employee that violates ethics rules could face more consequences than simply losing their job, like fines or even jail time. There's no reason why similar penalties couldn't be applied in this instance. It'd certainly be super problematic to enforce, and the first time they were the case would almost certainly get appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, causing some very, very weird conversations about conflict of interest, but it's possible.\n\nNow, are fines and/or jail time even good enough in these situations if the justice still stays on the court and hears cases for which they're compromised? I'd say no, but if we can squeeze out even a little justice, I'll take it.So if a Justice of the Supreme Court were to murder someone, I'm assuming they could be held accountable and jailed for that. Is there some way to amend the criminal code, so that jail time was the punishment for a breach of the Supreme/Federal Court ethics? It wouldn't remove them from the court, but could prevent them from attending court and voting on rulings. Or is that just opening a huge can of worms?Whoever's got law enforcement officers with guns on their hips, honestly.[deleted]Id say citizens united was when it started for meStart?We should be past that now, but our society writ large is lazy, apathetic, and not even remotely engaged.Whenever I see a picture of Clarence Thomas sitting in his robe, his slightly closed shifty looking eyes follow me around.Because you would just challenge someone to a duel and shoot them if they did something stupid or corrupt.\"The Constitution does not specifically allow the Legislative branch to enforce any policies on the Judiciary.  The Senate Ethics standards are hereby overturned in a 6-3 ruling.\"He\u2019s not on the Judiciary Committee.For sure, like I said it\u2019s hypothetical.This nation needs a fucking enema.Spoiler: we wouldn\u2019t change. There already has been blatant corruption and one side celebrated.Actually some might argue the reason some of those additional penalties might be available is the idea of the separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary. Depending on what Congress is trying to mandate the courts could argue they\u2019re overstepping their authority to micromanage how the courts operate internally.An even closer analogy than the murder one would be that a federal judge was convicted of bribery in 1991 while still being active on the bench. \n\n[Judge Is First Federal Jurist Convicted of Taking Bribe (1991)](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-06-30-mn-2566-story.html)\n\nNotice how in this case this federal judge was literally convicted of a crime that could put him in prison for 25 years but hadn\u2019t resigned and was still getting his federal salary because Congress hadn\u2019t impeached him. And while the judge specifically said that he would voluntarily not be hearing cases pending his appeal, hypothetically if he was really stubborn he could have refused to recuse himself from cases and kept working.\n\nThis story isn\u2019t all that far removed a scenario from Thomas. If the story gets more and more egregious about Thomas\u2019 shady dealings he could hypothetically run afoul of bribery or tax evasion laws, for example. But until he were actually removed through the impeachment process he\u2019d still be on the bench.Yes, completely ignoring the legal process and simply arresting a SCOTUS justice couldn't possibly backfire horribly for the White House and DoJ. \n\nThe chance of this happening is close enough to zero you can safely round it down.Sure they do.  They've ruled on subpoenas many times.  So far, they have generally deferred to Congress as having the right to subpoena testimony and documents, but would they do that for their own chief justice?  I would not bet on that.Honestly same. Lives in my nightmares.He has that strange side-eye look almost all the time. Except when he\u2019s on a yacht or drinking $10,000. bottles of wine.Oh, 100% there would be challenges, and quite frankly they could even have merit. Even without true merit, they'd be fighting an uphill battle. I'm simply pointing out that laws passed by Congress can write laws that would impose penalties upon members of other branches beyond impeachment, since the original concern was that any laws passed in this instance would be completely toothless in our current political climate.I'm not talking about completely ignoring the legal process, I'm talking (hypothetically) about enforcing a totally legal action against the Supreme Court that they refuse to acknowledge because they're corrupt. In that case, you could choose to follow a corrupt, illegal ruling because it's the Supreme Court and there's no one to appeal it to, or you could walk into John Roberts' office and take him into physical custody. All I'm saying is that *if* you did the latter, the fact that the Supreme Court said you couldn't would not matter that much. If the public accepted the arrest, then it would quickly become understood that the Supreme Court's self-immunizing ruling was corrupt and invalid, even though there's really no legal mechanism for that to be the case.It's interesting you took it that way.\n\nI took it to mean that cops are not famously known as radical liberals.  Most tend to skew the other way.[deleted]Fair enough.  I still believe this would backfire horribly, as it really does amount to ignoring the legal process because the outcome is unpalatable, and a hell of a lot of people would view this as a politically motivated arrest.  And aside from that, it wouldn't accomplish anything either, as Roberts could still easily refuse to actually say anything useful; he's not an idiot, and knows how this works.\n\nThere's just no realistic chance that this is going to happen whatsoever, even if Roberts were to get a subpoena and literally just respond publicly with 'Fuck off'.  I think it's only slightly hyperbolic to say that I'm about as likely to be elected pope as the Biden administration is to arrest the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS.The chance of the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS being arrested over this is zero.  I get that you really want reality to be otherwise, but it is what it is.  He's not going to be arrested, and anyone who seriously thinks this is going to happen is deluded.Oh for sure, there's no reasonable way this would happen. People wouldn't accept it, which would make it ultimately futile.\"People wouldn't accept it\" Just like people didn't accept Roe being overturned or an insurrection attempt?\n\nPeople will accept pretty much anything when they see that there's no consequences for the rich and powerful; maybe make some consequences.",

They want somebody in power to force you to believe what they want you to believe.>The House will be asked \"to determine\" if Zephyr's \"conduct\" on the House floor on Monday \"violated the rules, collective rights, safety, dignity, integrity, or decorum of the House,\" the letter reads.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity?

The obvious comparison to this brand of awful fascist bullshit is Tennessee, where the localities were able to reappoint their reps, but I'm curious how Montana handles itWhen is Biden going to invite Zephyr or Michaela Kavanaugh to the White House?Getting ready to pull a Tennessee on her.So fucking stupid, she did not do anything wrong.  The Republicans however are the ones that should be disciplined for their behavior.  \n\nI really am fearful for her.  I hope she stays safe.[deleted]This reminds me of the time Michigan State Representative Lisa Brown (D) was prohibited from speaking because she used the word \u201cvagina\u201d on the floor while arguing against an anti-abortion bill.Even my republican friends are saying this is wrong. They disagree with the protesting until I ask them to remember when anything got changed while being quiet. I\u2019ll remind them again in November.This is the first time I\u2019ve actually seen her name on anything. Her name needs to be on every article about her to really send it homeShe\u2019s going to be a state Senator by the time republicans are done. At this point republicans are the best campaign managers for progressive democratsThe Republicans are going to make a martyr out of her. Haven't they learned anything from the incident with the two Justins in Tennessee? It will also put the Montana Republicans under the microscope by the media. I very much doubt they are all squeaky clean.Thumbnail makes it look like she\u2019s casting a spellDonate to her campaign! https://www.zooeyzephyr.com/They apparently saw all the good press their buddies in Tennessee are getting and decided they wanted some of that.You know what they really want - they want corporal punishment for her.

Let them make her a martyr. The more attention called to their bigotry and bullying the better.\n\nIn a week or two we will have audio of them infighting and accusing each other of making them look like assholes.Oh I hope so, I really and truly hope so.Exactly. They're about to make her a national hero.Remind me what happened in Tennessee.The GOP seems to feel they are a privileged class that enjoys the protection of the law but is not bound by it, and the democrats a servant class that is bound by the law but not protected by it.They believe voters will not punish them for their actions. They believe gerrymandering and political chicanery will keep them from having to answer for the mockery practiced against members in the minority party. \nIt\u2019s up to voters to restore decency and fairness if they value it.If it comes to expulsion, [this article](https://www.ktvh.com/news/68th-session/republican-reps-stromswold-flament-resign-from-montana-legislature) outlines the process of replacement:\n\n>When a legislative seat becomes vacant, three nominees for the position are selected by the county central committee or committees for the party that currently holds the seat. County commissioners will then select the new legislator from that list of nominees.\n\nThat said, per legislative rules, expulsion requires an ethics committee, and constitutionally, referring a legislator for discipline requires 2/3 of the House to vote in favor.\n\nThis of course is if they follow their written rules and procedures or the state constitution.When someone figures out how to get to our family members who are caught up in the lies where they step back and reevaluate their political position, please make that tactic available.  \n\nI keep thinking this thing or that thing will finally be the last straw, but it just seemed like it all just makes them dig in their heels harder.I can't tell if you're trying to be funny or not and it scares me how accurate your comment could be.[Bot stole this comment. report them for spam and being a harmful bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12z473y/republican_leaders_seek_disciplinary_consequences/jhrqlg2?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)I'm sorry, *what*?So offensive!  (/s)I work for a nonprofit that did a lot of actions to get the Justins reinstated. I\u2019m really worried that if Rep. Zephyr is expelled we won\u2019t see anywhere near the same level of backlash. I\u2019m doing what I can to get it through to people but it\u2019s a rough fight.I hope so. She seems like the leader we need right now. She's courageous, smart, and very articulate.  I hope all of the decent people in our country rally behind her as we move forward to a more inclusive world.I think she is already there. If they didn't silence her, nationally no one would know who she is.Tennessee channeled some real Jim Crow era bullshit and expelled two Black representatives for protesting against gun violence on the floor of the House (and notably did not expel the white woman who joined them in their protest)\n\nBoth reps were reappointed by their districts and are still in the House, but yikesYeah it is so wrong what they are doing - I used to think their was a line they wouldn\u2019t cross - I was so wrong. Really at this point anything - anything could happen and a fair amount of the population would agree with it.Happened in Tennessee.  When the republicans were trying to expel the three democrats who joined the protest, they pointed out a litany of issues that hasn\u2019t lead to expulsion for other members including one of them pissing on a coworkers chair.  Can\u2019t make this shit up. Oh and the chair pissing was because a Republican was mad about shit that happened\u2026on Twitter.  \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/08/tennessee-descent-statehouse-mag-00091090How can we help?Not only that, once the two Dem Reps, people began taking a closer look at the asshole Republicans who voted to remove them. Tennessee Republican Rep. Scotty Campbell was forced to step down after sexual harassment allegations resurfaced as a result. So not only did the Democratic Reps. come back  with more support and national attention than ever before, one of the Republican pricks who voted them out was given the boot for some *serious ethics violations.* A fat roach fleeing from the light.\n\nIf Rep. Zephyr gets the same treatment as the Tennessee Three, I won\u2019t be surprised if we see a repeat of the same events. Republicans aren\u2019t exactly known for learning from past mistakes, after all.Of course, I remember that. Sorry, I'd assumed ~~you were~~ OP was referring to something trans related.Right before and after the house chair said that 1. They would not fix the gun problem and then 2. Asked the KIDS protesting and seeking gun reform, which firearm they\u2019d be comfortable being shot with.Thank you for asking. Stay informed first of all. \n\nIf you\u2019re in Montana, call your reps and be emphatic in your support of Rep. zephyr. And yes, always call them. Don\u2019t text or email. Call. \n\nIf you\u2019re not in Montana, spread awareness to your networks and tag organizations that can help like the ACLU, National Center for Transgender Equality, HRC, and anyone else you can think of. I\u2019m the type of person at my org who sees those things and sends them up the ladder (or at least tries to).Would be great if the Tennessee Three came to support her. Just really started connecting this type of Democrat and Liberal around the country.Thanks for sharing that bit of info about Campbell, I was not aware that happened. That's some straight up poetic justice right there!There's a *lot* of awful trans stuff happening lately and it's eating up all my attention, I get itThank you for asking.

Putting aside the overwhelming mountain of evidence that he has done some shady shit, having broken the trust of the American public in SCOTUS is a really bad and dangerous thing.  That's why recusal is a thing.\n\nHe and Gorsuch at the very least need to resign or be removed immediately in light of these recent revelations.  I won't hold my breath though.  Kavanaugh should have been removed a long time ago (or better yet, never confirmed), but he's still there, too.Am I the only one that thinks this is a terrible move? Democrats' messaging right now should be \"Republicans need to decide if this is consistent with their values and ethical standards.\"\n\nSaying \"forfeit, loser\" is just going to make everybody dig in and rally around him.Yeah resign, get his lavish pension, keep all his \u2018gifts\u2019 and continue going on expensive free trips with his buddy. Meanwhile George Floyd was murdered by cops for selling cigarettes on a street corner. Justice in America!This was true decades ago.> Markey calls for Clarence Thomas to resign: \u2018reputation is unsalvageable\u2019\n\nSeems like many people that don't like Clarence Thomas are asking him to resign.Reading is hard. I thought that read, \"Monkey calls for Clarence Thomas to resign. \"... and I was much more interested in the headline... \n\nI'm like... is this an exceptional Monkey? Did it use sign language to tell people? How does it know about C.T.? \n\nOr ... Were the writers just calling someone a Monkey? That isn't very nice, and possibly racist. \n\n\nThen my brain stops ADHDing and I see it's Markey not monkey, and I'm like... oh that guy. Not as interesting. \n\n\nNow I'm off to Google Monkeys in politics.Ok, which constitutional originalist judge should replace him?[deleted]Isn't it eerie how all of them use that line \"this is not how our founders of the constitution would have wanted it\".  It's exactly how they wanted it.Then they should also call for the criminal Joe Biden to resign.Biden could remove him with the stroke of a pen yet he does nothing.Not a chance.  At all.Isn\u2019t happening so long as republicans control\nthe house.The messiah of their party tried to overthrow the government, not a chance this asshat resigns.Won't happen as long as a Democrat is there to replace him.\n\nEven if there were a Republican President, I doubt he'd voluntarily step down.He\u2019s right about that. He\u2019s wrong to think Thomas cares.\u201cLol no.\u201d\n-Clearance ThomasThe Chief Justice just pleaded nolo on Thomas\u2019s behalf.Thomas has said that he loves making liberals mad. He\u2019s never going to give an inch, let alone resign.Lock him up!Can these people be a bigger joke\u201cMake me\u201d will be all he\u2019ll say.  And we can\u2019tCT isn't going to resign.Narrator- \u201che won\u2019t\u201dthere\u2019s no less than four fully compromised supreme court justices, get \u2018em the fuck outta hereJust resign?? Prosecute him\u2026Thomas is a piece of shit. That is all.I don\u2019t understand how these people have the \u201coption\u201d to resign. Of course they\u2019re not going to quit their cake job that pays millions, they should be forced out, aka fired.Future trips.Why would he resign? There's absolutely no Constitutional requirement to do so.\n\nSeriously, the best that can happen is that Congress passes a law to change it, or maybe even require an Amendment. It might be tough to hear, but anyone else believing otherwise is dreaming.Clarence do the right non-partisan thing to do RESIGN!!!! And write your book of lies or maybe you can be truthful not being on the bench.I misread that to say \u201cThomas is to resign\u201d and thought no way would he act honorably and do that.THEY DONT GIVE A SHIT. We have people in the house and senate that plotted to overturn an election and when faced with a mob of their own design, turned and blamed it on antifa. These people have no shame that bribes can\u2019t rinse away. Take action to root out corruption and greed or you will see the slow and agonizing crumbling of the country. Given how much of the gop supports russian propaganda, it\u2019s probably to late anyway.I read that as \u201cMalarkey calls\u2026\u201dPretty sure Thomas doesn't give a flying fuck about his reputation.Markey is sick and tired of all this malarkey.If the allegations at true, resigning his position is not nearly enough. Dude needs to be locked up.And this call to resign is going to compel him to actually do that by what mechanism? The Attorney General of the US has shown zero inclination to charge anyone in a position of power with any of the crimes that they have been linked to, so that\u2019s a dead end. The Senate is, at best, a 50/50 split and they have already packed the Supreme Court with people fanatically loyal to their cause so with no Constitutional method of removing crooked justices and without the congressional majorities in both houses to push through increasing the number of Supreme Court Justices the *alleged* crimes of any Justice are not going to be investigated and even if they were, there isn\u2019t a constitutional means other than a vote to impeach by the House and a  2/3rds majority vote by the Senate that can remove them, same as removing a President. Even if there is irrefutable proof that they have committed crimes or abused their authority.The day that Pauly Shore hooks up with Kate Middleton is the day this motherfucker will resign.Hard to believe there\u2019s arguably a more heinous modern day Benedict Arnold actively in government outside of McConnell.Lol, he's definitely not going to do that.>  \u2018reputation is unsalvageable\u2019\n\nBut power is undiminished, so he's going to stay right where he is, unbothered by the peasants petty \"ethics\" complaints.The small problem is Clarence Thomas don\u2019t give a f*** about his reputationHe might even do it, next time there\u2019s a republican president.He's already a Justice for life. He doesn't need a reputation and he knows it.Conservatives when corrupt seem to have more support, the more lies the better. An embarrassment to the US.Now, if you could just get 74 of your colleagues to agree, that would be worth a headline\u2026For a brief moment, I thought that Biz Markie was calling for Clarence Thomas to resign.Notice how they are trotting out the usual nobody senators to demand Clarence Thomas resign and not mounting a full scale impeachment effort. They want it to appear as if they are banging the table in rage while not actually doing it, because this whole thing would turn into a circular firing squad if they were to mount a serious investigation and what would come out on EVERY Supreme Court justice and senator, not just the ones wearing the opposing teams colors.He won\u2019t resign until the person picking has a R as their party.He'll resign, in about 6 months when the republicans can claim its too close to a presidential election to replace him. Cause you know, hes a partisan asshole.America needs a non-partisan movement to reform your entire political system.\n\n* Increase the size of supreme court, establish new bipartisan rules for nomination (must have 2/3rds majority of both houses) and set term limits. \n* End gerrymandering and establish common standards for election monitoring and voter access. \n* Strictly regulate the flow of donations to politicians, political parties and issue campaigns. Basically an anti-lobbying bill. \n* Increase the size of congress and introduce a new PR system for elections. \n* Introduce a more proportional system for senators - 1 for the smallest states and 3 for the largest.They thought a lot about safeguards against individual autocrats, but they didn\u2019t anticipate a two-party system where one of the two parties lines up behind tyranny.The Constitution spells out that they serve \u201cduring good behavior\u201d. To me arresting and convicting this asshat would Constitutionally strip him of his power. \n\nWe should do that.Alexander Hamilton wrote that the judiciary was the least dangerous branch of government in response to some eerily prescient concerns about it from opponents of the Constitution. I had to read some of the Anti-Federalist  papers from Brutus recently and they\u2019re shockingly relevant on that point. There were Americans who predicted this kind of scenario centuries ahead of time. You really can tell from the lack of checks on the judiciary that among the Founders\u2019 many mistakes was an excessive faith in judges.The founding fathers were scum. They used bullshit linguistic tricks to install a white-supremacist, genocidal, oligarchic government run by their family and friends, who are also scum. This is it working exactly as intended.\n\nEdit: I guess Howard Zinn isn't popular here.The constitution is toilet paper.It\u2019s a much different time now, of course. In those days there was a common enemy, the British. Everyone, for the most part, wanted the US to succeed against tyrannical overlords. \n\nBut these days we have no common enemy so the enemy is the opposition, and we spend all of our time and effort hopelessly fighting against each other.Not necessarily the better good, but at least self-preservation.\n\nBut power between government and many private entities has become highly intertwined and imbalanced, that a corrupt person\u2019s self-preservation cannot be threatened by the arm of the government.\n\nOne is tempted to say Cheney or Bush should have been set to examples, but this really is going further back.\n\nFundamentally, power is such a complex thing now, that we find it difficult to exact justice on those who harm the integrity of the system.Look, the government has to work toward the betterment of the wealthy, don't fret the good will trickle down to you eventually, once all your personal liberties are stripped.Well, it was also written when the gap between rich and poor didn't involve yachts.A lot of good faith put into it.  It's just a shame that there are a bunch of bad faith actors going around and fucking it up for everyone.Since the 70sYeah for about 200 years.that was not the case at the founding either.\n\nthe original checks and balances are specifically aimed at scounderels. \n\npeople at that time were as bad, or worse in many ways, than today's scoundrel.It wasn\u2019t the case ever. Slavery was both allowed and slaves were counted as 3/5ths of a person for deciding how many Congressmen a state would have to represent them, proportionately, in the House. The South wanted slaves to count towards their population but not as a full human, only 3/5ths of one- Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution.\n\nFurthermore the existence and political power of parties was completely ignored by the framers of the Constitution. Parties already existed, in fact they had existed for some time in the Colonies and even in England, which was still somewhat really run by a monarchy, so I think ignoring the political consequences and power of parties wasn\u2019t an oversight it was intentional. If your party holds 1 more seat than 1/3 of the Senators you can stop any President or Court Justice from being removed no matter what he did or how much evidence there is that they did it.Not only that, the clause that grants lifetime appointment was meant to curb interests from blackmailing judges.  The idea was that if you are appointed for life than someone can\u2019t tell you to vote this way or they will donate to someone who can have you replaced.\n\nIt was never intended to stop corruption directly, that\u2019s just the public completely missing the point.\n\nThe issue is that legally speaking, there is no clause in the constitution that defines a bribe and that\u2019s what Clearance Thomas\u2019 defense would fall back on if needed.The only protection our democracy has against bad faith actors is the assumption that a majority of the system will always be run by those acting in good faith and that, as necessary, those bad actors will be removed.\n\nThere is another assumption coupled to this - that those politicians who act in bad faith won't win reelection.\n\nNeither of those assumptions has proven true.[deleted]My god, that man is such a piece of shit. \n\nBtw, I know that\u2019s not breaking news. I am old enough to remember Anita Hill hearings so, we\u2019ve all known for a long time but occasionally I like to say it because it\u2019s just so fucking true.It is too bad that he will never learn that it is himself that made his life miserable. He has only himself to blame for any perceived misery.That shit is so dispicable I hit the downvote button out of reflex before I remembered I was reading a quote. Not a single decent, informed person who's acting in good faith believes that man should still be on the bench.I'm old enough to remember a time when a statement like this alone would have been enough to at least look towards impeachment.seems like we have 12 more years before he croaks or resigns or something.It was clear from the outset of his confirmation hearings that Clancy Thomas was\u2014and continues to be\u2014a small-minded, not-very-bright, unqualified candidate for the high bench. His sow of a wife by herself should disqualify him.\n\nThe right-wing partisans just didn't give a shit when Clancy was appointed.  They were looking for a black judge for window dressing, and this is what we got.  Thurgood Marshall, whom he \"replaced\" was also black, and one of the greatest justices of the 20th century.  Skin color has nothing to do with qualifications.  A brilliant mind and a true judicial temperament have EVERYTHING to do with it.\n\n JMHO, but I remember Clancy's confirmation hearings well.  Now we're saddled  with Orange Fatso's miserable appointees as well.  Add to that a chicken-shit chief justice and \"Simpering Sammy\" Alito, and there we are.\n\nIt ain't pretty.  Worse, there's a huge lack of real and impartial judges on the US Supreme Court.\n\nOrange Fatso told us he intended to weaponize the judiciary.  He kept his promise.Oh, the nostalgia....Current American philosophy of law: Law is Power and Power is Law; a good lawyer has good connections and can grease the palms. \n\nI am not happy about this cold hard new reality, but I have finally stopped pretending it away. \n\nI don\u2019t know how it can be fixed so long as the highest court is the epitome of that new reality. It has emboldened lower courts to be no better. It isn\u2019t going to stop on its own. Give it another decade and many more courts will be like this. It will become normalized.I'd bet all my money that if Thomas were convicted of a crime he would not resign and Republicans would not impeach/remove him. He would continue to serve on the court by just sitting in prison and fuming about how liberals are such big meanies.He's going nowhere.  That smirk of his speaks volumes, \"Bastards, you can't touch me and I am going to stick it up your butt every chance I get.\"Even if he did plan to resign for some reason, he wouldn\u2019t do it with a Democrat in the Oval Office.I'm not that old but it's not talked about enough that the republicans stole the 2000 election. Thats why \"stop the count\" was a thing in 2020 because it had worked for them before.\n\nI often wonder if 9/11 or the Iraq/Afghanistan war would have even come to pass. I truly view that as a critical down turning point for our countryi'm sorry but why are you posting this here?Half the time that doesn't even matter if it goes against the modern republican hive mind. They just call them a RINO, oust them from the party, and keep going. Liz Cheney died for the last shred of integrity the GOP had and even she's a piece of shit.Well that\u2019s a big pessimistic FU to all the people that make those really run and keep us out of real trouble we don\u2019t even know yet.No too many republicans have control still. Not enough votes for impeachment . The myth that Dems as a whole don\u2019t fight hard is perpetuated by eye for an eye bullshit. I\u2019d rather Dems not be the lying cheating assholes Pubes are thanks.For what?Biden can\u2019t do that. He absolutely can\u2019t.\n\nA Justice must be impeached by the house and removed by trial resulting in conviction in the senate. \n\nThe only other plausible and untested way would be if he went to prison due to being convicted of a regular crime. It\u2019s unclear if a Justice can serve from prison. (Probably not.)You could have just said that you have no idea how the Government works instead of making people read your insanely wrong comment.No, it doesn\u2019t work that way. \n\nFederal judges can only be removed through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction in the Senate.They also had way too much faith in judges. You can see it in the Federalist Papers that were published in response to Brutus. I had to read some of the Brutus papers recently and dude was eerily prescient about the dangers of the judiciary set up by the Constitution. It really is striking how few checks on the judiciary there are in relation to the sort of paranoia with which the Founders treated the other branches of government.What are you talking about? They absolutely descended straight to a two party system right away. Thomas Jefferson couldn\u2019t accept the fact that he lost to John Adams in 1796, both clearly had defined political parties, the democratic-republicans for Jefferson and the federalists for Adams, with Jefferson losing because of how the electoral college decided the presidency. Jefferson was quick to force changes to the constitution because he lost to benefit himself and his cronies.They kinda did. Washington even warned of it in his farewell address too-\n\n\n>The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n\n>All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.\n\n>However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n\n*George Washington  \nFarewell Address  \nSeptember 17, 1796*>\"However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\"\n\nGeorge Washington, farewell addressThey did worry about it, but they didn\u2019t enshrine it into legislation, so here we are.Or two of the two.Both parties line up to trough and the tyranny of money and the monied interests which is to maintain the status quo at all costs. If there is some erosion within society it will be in workers incomes and on the backs of those who least can afford it so saith the MONEY. Amen.\n\nThe beatings will continue until moral improves.both parties think you are talking about the other party. think about that for a minute and get back to me.Both of them are lining up, but I get what you mean.But the thing is, there are no safeguards possible against what you're describing.  If a country is actually a democracy, it means that they have the ability to vote for legislation ending that democracy, and the process of passing legislation always comes down to a yes/no vote.  Two options.  So for any bill, you're always going to have two coalitions.  How those coalitions form are immaterial.  The \"safeguard\" of having many political parties only made it easier for unscrupulous politicians like Harper in Canada and Johnson in the UK to gain positions of power by consolidating the right wing voters and splitting the left.  Any safeguard that can be implemented is only as strong as the integrity of the people operating it.  And ultimately, the people responsible for operating those safeguards are put there by the voters.  The severity of the problems that we have in the US now can't be minimized as just a flaw from the founding fathers.  It's a flaw from our culture, and it's that culture that needs to shift in order to start to fix them.sure, they exactly thought that very thought about the Whigs or the Tories. \n\n(not above tar and feathering the oposition> where one of the two parties lines up behind tyranny\n\nthe bombardment of Ft Sumter ?though, to be fair, it was somewhat shortsighted and very hopefully naive from their side.\n\nthey literally were running from tyranny. it was unlikely that wasn't gonna get repeated soon enough.\n\nbut we must have hopeYou start talking like that and they'll add an amendment to the constitution to 'adjust for modern day changes'.A grand jury indictment would be nice.Yeah, all the self-serving bastards should be arrested. That would entail most of congress, several members of the Supreme Court, most of the recent presidential candidates (and subsequently presidents).Well, arguably, the founders and the founding documents were predicated on landowners. As such, there is an inherent predisposition towards siding on behalf of the wealthy. That said, I agree with you, there was \u2018Faith\u2019 that leaders of the country would only authorize well qualified judges who were focused on law and it\u2019s application. Among others, one of the \u2018oopsies\u2019 within the constitution.I guess I still agree, it *is* the least dangerous, because it can only be so harmful if allowed to get this way by the more dangerous branches.Honoring the Founding fathers and constitution are basically American civic religion and some people don't take kindly to that being called into questionStop it, seriously. Look at the late 1700\u2019s and compare them to other nations. Western Europe was doing the exact same thing, Doesn\u2019t make it right, but \u2018normal\u2019 is defined by the period. You cannot take 2023 norms and apply it to 1780. Not only is it irrelevant, it\u2019s historically ignorant. Would it have been nice if founders did things 100% without the objectification and subjugation of humans? Given full rights to all citizens and provided a framework for how to deal with the subrogation of the communal whole? Obviously, but that\u2019s not how the world worked at the time. The world was almost exclusively monarchal, non landowners (lords) remained peasants, and owning humans was the last of the land. This was not an American failings, but a planetary one.I agree. It's widely acknowledged that things that are normal **now** are profoundly immoral. Slavery has been condemned in every era. Even if that idea was unpopular at times, it was still every bit as true then as it is today.\n\nWhen our descendants judge us, I hope they are blisteringly thorough in their criticism.Ouch. At least one of them was actually worth something. George seemed like a stand up guy. He even fought in the war he started.\n\nJackson was a piece of shit though 100%. And Jefferson And Handcock... and Franklin...\n\nLISTEN, THINGS WERE GOING PRETTY BAD UNTIL ABE SHOWED UP IM NOT GONNA LIE! ... then he got executed... also he shipped the blacks to the island nations because it was cheaper than sending them back home to africa...\n\nListen... Theodore was pretty based except for the whole massacre of the natives thing...\n\nALRIGHT BUT FDR GOT US THROUGH WW2 LIKE A BOSS AND SAID A LOT OF PRO WORKER SHIT... But he did only give workers 'just enough' to 'quiet the rabble'... and was ready to make our country entirely democratic (before the switch) by basically doing w/e he wanted and stacking the systems in his parties favor if the other side didnt give in...\n\nWasnt JFK just handsome, though? And Raegan, he was pretty popular, he was a movie star afterall! And who can forget George W, the silly monkey man dodged those shows perfectly. And Obama, our first african american president, wasnt he just great!\n\n...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, we had 1 diamond in the rough from the sound of things. And we were ready to make him king, and he turned it down because he believed in SOMETHING good, right? We've just been basically mining coal since we found that first diamond... but you say theres a chance!?!?!?Hit the nail on the head my friend, not your fault some scoundrels had their last refuge hanging on it...Then you have Kavanaugh losing his shit at his confirmation hearing and not even hiding his vindictiveness. Lashing out at the fucking Clintons for his fuck ups.It's the republican motto, 'in defeat vengeance, in victory malice!'Laws for thee and not for me!  I was very young when he was being confirmed, but not so young as I didn't know he was a shit bird back then, too.  Some men just want to watch the world burn I guess.Vindictiveness may not be what being a judge is about, but it is exactly what being a Republican is about. Hate and intolerance IS the platform.It's especially maddening for those of us who lived through it, because we've known for decades what a piece of shit he is. And the longer he's gotten away with it, the more brazen he's become.\n\nHe is not on board with the American experiment, because in his mind, it failed him, so he figures fuck it, he's gonna get his, and fuck everyone else. And the process that was supposed to be in place to preserve the integrity of the Supreme Court failed and continues to fail. We have to figure out how to fix it.Yep, the days of long dong silver.No you\u2019re not lolIt doesn\u2019t matter, as the Constitution says they only serve \u201cduring good behavior\u201d. If impeachment was the only way to remove them, why spell that out? Because it\u2019s not and he would be stripped of power the moment he is convicted.> I often wonder if 9/11 or the Iraq/Afghanistan war would have even come to pass.\n\nIraq - it's hard to imagine why any other president (or, in that case more importantly, vice president) would have thought that was an idea even remotely worth considering.\n\nAfghanistan - it's widely reported that in the transition of administration - (I don't know if you're old enough to remember those) Clinton warned the incoming Bush team that al Q'Aeda generally, and bin Laden in particular, was the biggest existential threat on the radar.* And the Bush team tossed the dossier, along with everything else that had the Clinton seal.\\*\\*\n\n9/11 - See above. Hard to say. Did you see *Charlie Wilson's War*?\n\n\\* *Of course, it wasn't. Climate change was an even more pressing threat, but Clinton had already pre-fucked that one.)*\n\n\\*\\* *OFC, pettiness and spite was not one-sided. When the outgoing Clinton team left, they reportedly took the 'W' keys from all the White House keyboards*Because post was about Markey.The Supreme Court was never meant to have as much power as they do, they gave themselves a ton of power and nobody ever questioned it.It\u2019s an aristocracy by another name. It\u2019s there to protect the ruling class not the public.Exactly. They knew it would happen, but they were too divided to make proper safeguards they all would agree with (because most wanted their own side to soon gain total control). It's actually amazing it has lasted this long.\n\nIf anyone thinks the \"founding fathers\" were all aligned, then I suggest you read some of what they actually wrote, before it's lost to history.It happened quickly after, but the Constitution isn't designed for it. They didn't *anticipate* it before writing/passing the Constitution.Wtf George Washington was a communist?To be fair beatings ought to continue to intellectually lazy both sides-ists with no actual solutions or any visible work toward those solutions anyway.\n\nA healthy skepticism of large institutions as a rule is fine, but firebrands and iconoclasts defined by said skepticism are vastly more dangerous to society as the GOP has taught us the last hundred years, they ironically become the easiest to manipulate needing to convince everyone they know something the masses don't.I only see one side taking away rights.Flat earthers make documentaries. What's your point?Do you think both parties are equally accurate in their beliefs of the other?The irony is that they trusted judges to judge within the confines of the law. One of the biggest case of oppsie daisies ever that we just cant stop making as a species. A judge is supposed to uphold the law and side within legality, who could of thought a judge, what is a human, could be bought/controlled/have an agenda.\n\nMadness!\n\nThey also trusted politicians to act in good faith, and that said good faith would/should win out over the bad. Id like to know wtf Franklin was smoking, probably that dank kush from Jefferson's family farm if you know what im sayin\\~\\~\\~! Racism is bad.Western European countries have better governance systems now precisely because our constitution is so terrible.Thank you for this. I\u2019m so fed up with the contemporary desire to extract historical figures from historical context. There is an arc to history and an evolution of ideals.  What was advanced by the enlightenment thinkers of the time set the foundation for liberal democracy just like DOS set the stage for Windows. Are we do for a further upgrade? You bet, but stop with the nonsense about how the early framers were so shortsighted.>Stop it, seriously. Look at the late 1700\u2019s and compare them to other nations. Western Europe was doing the exact same thing, Doesn\u2019t make it right, but \u2018normal\u2019 is defined by the period. You cannot take 2023 norms and apply it to 1780. \n\nWhen my government is still based on the norms of 1780 in the year of our lord 2023, I absolutely will apply 2023 normsGotta own the cowardly things we've done and left undoneFuck. This is gooodAll while trying not to draw any attention to how he was on the legal team investigating Bill Clinton, and that he was the literal person asking outrageous questions about sex so as to make anyone watching at home shocked, and to associate any of that with Bill.\n\nLike every conservative cry, it\u2019s protection. He went in on the Clintons. It\u2019s like how thieves assume everyone else around them is a thieve.That\u2019s not their words, but it\u2019s common enough that it may as well be, similar to how everyone associates House Trump with \u201ca Trump never pays their debts\u201d instead of their actual house words of \u201cPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.\u201d  The actual words of the Republican Party are \u201cI got Mine\u201d.Repubs: Poor losers; worse winners.Reddit doesnt allow the use of words in a way structured in a sentence that would be needed to 'fix it', because the thing that was supposed to stop that failed WAS supposed to be the thing that kept it working.\n\nWhich means you gotta fix that first. Heres the funny part, the thing that was supposed to keep that thing from failing, failed as well so you gotta fix THAT too. Problem is, is the other one that failed was suppose to be prevented from failing by the supreme court which failed and now we've come full circle. So the 3 things that are supposed to make sure eachother dont fail, have all failed each other and thus failed themselves. Which means they failed us. Which means WE have to fix it... which reddit wont allow me to say how because its not something that can just be fixed easily through conversation. And it wont be fun, and we ALL have to want it and participate. If 1/2 - 1/4 the nation disagrees then it cant be fixed. And too many would be quick to try to grab that vacuum which we'd also have to be against.Christian Nationalists, & other fascists like the remaining members of the GOP, don't care about words or their meaning - see that Jean-Paul Sartre quote. They intentionally destroy their meaning & play linguistic games to make others act with force against them so that they can then disingenuously pretend like they're the offended party.> It doesn\u2019t matter, as the Constitution says they only serve \u201cduring good behavior\u201d. If impeachment was the only way to remove them, why spell that out? Because it\u2019s not and he would be stripped of power the moment he is convicted.\n\nBy who?  The Constitution doesn't define \"good behavior\", doesn't specify who gets to decide what \"good behavior\" is, and doesn't specify who's responsible for or even authorized to enforce it.  And I think the last thing we want is for a hyper-partisan Congress to suddenly get the power to decide these things; the last thing we want is a GOP-led House to decide that Ketanji Brown Jackson is no longer qualified to serve because she got a speeding ticket that one time.\n\nImpeachment and removal is the only way defined in the Constitution.   Any other method would imply that other branches of government have powers that they simply do not have, and powers that could easily be abused by the majority party even if only out of spite/revenge.You\u2019re asking Redditors to actually *read* the article they comment on?Weird how the \"strict textualists\" both within and beyond the court never get caught up on this point...Yep, read the letters and the notes from the founders. Many of them expressed concern that the Judiciary could usurp power if left unchecked.Before it's lost to gop politicians banning the learning of historyit's really surprising how modern americans think the founding fathers were some kind of genius, god-like figures who can't possibly be wrong. \"they said this, they said that\"\n\nshit like this shows again and again that they were as flawed (naturally) as we are, and whatever they implemented need to be revisited again and again for improvement.Duverger would disagree with your first statement thereParties already existed before the American Revolution and had defined names and an outline of policies that they supported even while the Constitution was being written- remember that the first legal form of Government in the US wasn\u2019t the Constitution of the United States but the Articles of Confederation which was put in place in 1781 and the Constitution was ratified by enough states to become effective starting in 1787, 6 years later because the national government was too weak to do much under the Articles of Confederation. You had the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party and probably a handful of smaller parties most of which existed in some form before the US Revolution.Why does acknowledging that neither political party truly has my best interests at heart make me intellectually lazy? Please elaborate on why you\u2019re smarter than me.ionno man... one side is taking away rights in broad daylight and the other is trying to give waaaay more rights to others, which by proxy is taking away rights without necessarily taking away rights unless it doesnt effect me.\n\nIf you know which is which, get back to me as well.> Any other method would imply that other branches of government have powers that they simply do not have\n\nYou mean to suggest that only the SCOTUS is permitted extra-constitutional powers? Because there is no mention of judicial review in the constitution.It doesn\u2019t have to define good behavior because it\u2019s pretty evident what the founders intended by it. \n\nThe executive enforces the law; you\u2019d know that if you ever stepped foot in a legitimate history or civics class.Jes' doing my bit to save them from reading it!Politically speaking, who would reveal that openly if they were benefiting from it with the way incentives (and bribery) are basically inherent.It has nothing to do with intelligence.\n\nYou're willfully ignoring blatant and constant evidence to the contrary.\n\nSuch as the Democratic Party's behavior since at least 2008 for instance.\n\nThe years between 2008 and 2016 were the upper limit on being nice and persuasive and educational to people like you, that limit on patience should have been long since reached.\n\nIf you project enemies where there are none you eventually make them from nothing, and you've learned exactly jack shit from the Republicans doing exactly that with their projections. Quit being a surly troglodyte.\n\nNothing to do with intelligence and everything to do with salt on the part of stupid 'both-sides-do-X' while willfully ignoring context and everyone else is right sick of it. If you're going to do it to be contrary, you may as well not be in a position to say it at all.I'll let you know after 2024 if I have a right to exist or not.What?  Giving people rights does not take rights from others.  Equality seems like oppression when you're used to privilege.ah yes the zero sum game paranoid shitters showing up to complain about long overdue basic respectSo you're against people getting rights?\n \nMaybe if Republicans and their voters weren't so fucking shitty then democrats wouldn't need to give rights to people. \n \nBecause those rights should be inherent. But Republicans are shitty.Your tone suggests you think some rights are being given to some people unfairly.  Can you elaborate?\"When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.\"WTF are you talking about?You don\u2019t know me. Why do you have the right to tell me that my opinion of neither party has my best interest at heart is me being ignorant? Sounds like you\u2019re being ignorant and forcing what you think is best for you on to me. I\u2019ve been alive long enough to know that neither democrats as a whole nor republicans as a whole have my best interests at heart. I\u2019ve believed in democrats and I\u2019ve believed in republicans. I\u2019ve been disappointed by both. It\u2019s not intellectually lazy to acknowledge our political system isn\u2019t perfect. It isn\u2019t intellectually lazy to point out that there are criminals working for both parties. Sounds to me like you\u2019re just whining that everybody isn\u2019t conforming to what you believe to be the \u201cobvious answer.\u201d The right largely falling into the massive cult known as maga doesn\u2019t automatically mean the left are saints. They may be by comparison, but that isn\u2019t good enough for me, and quite frankly it shouldn\u2019t be good enough for anybody. We should all demand more/better from the people we elect to represent us. Or else, we\u2019re just playing a game that we\u2019ll never win.\n\nEdit: If you disagree with my last few sentences, you are objectively part of the problem....could you get back to me a little sooner, i might not have the right to exist either...I mean have you seen all this Christian non-sense going on? 10 commandments at MY kids school? sounds a bit unfair to me. what happened to separation of church and state? And giving them time to 'read the bible' but nothing else? Unreasonable. And the shift to funding private schools with public money so they can force you to either convert to the way of the private school or be home-schooled which is largely illegal if there isnt an adult/guardian present with them in most places under a certain age plus the curriculum taught is still based largely around the school district you live in. Ludacris. And about those Christian changes, in most instances you arent allowed to have an equivalent but different religious practice/alternative. It has to be Christian, they just havent decided WHICH version of Christianity, that fight comes later.\n\nOf course i know you are trying to bait me into saying something bigoted and/or racist. I dont know why we all cant just have nothing instead of 1 group/s getting more over another before losing it too, its how the ***Rich and ones in control*** really want things. They just gotta go down 1 side of the road and destroy it before they can do the other side. We're all fucked regardless of whose in charge, neither side is going to side with the rabble. We dont pay well enough.\n\nI feel both parties want the same goal, but they are both trying to destroy/pave the road at different points and are meeting in the middle which is where all this steam and smoke is coming from. If it wasnt the case, all the shit thats being overturned WOULDNT of been allowed to be overturned and would of been written into law. When was the last time ANY politician trusted 'good faith'? Shit should of been in law and not just 'precedent' if it could of been. Its been on the ballots for 30+ years and just kept getting pissed away. But its K, they sang a nice song after the first major upset. Totally on our sides.\n\n**Edit: TLDR; both sides can suck it.**Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.\n\nAlso, your counterpoint of it not being lazy to point out there are criminals on both sides is in itself fucking lazy.  Boiling the point down to  \"Is there at least 1 criminal in this political party?\" as your litmus test for not supporting them, or at least portraying it as such here, is incredibly reductive.I don't have to know you specifically, to know that learned helplessness is a stupid anarchist pissing match for no reason.\n\nIt's not just you, ANYONE who says 'both parties are corrupt' says more about the voter being useless and wants a simple solution to a complex, long ongoing problem and erroneously thinks they won't end up in the gulag somehow if they take the 'burn it all down' tack.\n\nEspecially when there's mounds of evidence that the party that is actually trying to help you is being obstructed by Republican right wing institutional corruption and gerontacracy both in general.\n\nThat's why it's intellectually lazy. It's learned helplessness snarked off as vented sarcasm and spammed forever with no actual attention or effort to identify the problem properly.Lol unless you're in a red state and are not straight, you'll be fine.  \n  \nPlease outline how the Democrats are going to take your right to exist away?  \n  \nOh, they aren't?  Great.Your only concrete examples are all things that are unquestionably backed by the right-leaning party within the US.  Considering this is also the party that's actively seeking to reduce the rights of others, I'm not sure how your examples support your earlier implication of 'both sides.'Everybody wants a simple solution to the problem. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t exist and likely never will. You can\u2019t bring up \u201cmounds of evidence\u201d and then not provide any. I am typically left leaning, but republicans aren\u2019t always wrong. I felt Bernie was someone who was trying to help, and that\u2019s why I voted for him, twice. In smaller elections, I\u2019ve felt the Republican candidate was the one who was trying to help. Did we all just forget that the Democratic party you claim is trying to help screwed Bernie over in favor of basically the one person on the planet capable of losing to that orange shitbag? Forget Bernie, they could have picked essentially any other candidate, and they likely would have beaten Trump. But, no, we were force fed Hillary, and then we were left with Trump. I don\u2019t have a solution because It\u2019s not my job to come up with a solution and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m pretending to be smart enough to come up with a well thought out and rational solution, but I am smart enough to realize what\u2019s currently in place isn\u2019t working. You can divvy up the blame how you like, but to act like one party is to blame and the other is blameless is absurd to me. You\u2019re willing to sweep the transgressions of democrats under the rug because you believe that, overall, if the country was in their hands, things would be better. I disagree, which, I guess, makes me intellectually lazy\ud83e\udee1Yep, they think it's a zero sum game. Like, if we allow Trans people to have the right to exist somehow straight people lose some rightsI mean, spinning segregation as a good thing is a start for the left.\n\nGiving them their own special private places, special bathrooms, special doctors, special everything. Back when segregation was a thing, it was what was happening then. But because a group suddenly wants to be 'segregated' its okay. Which is ironic because the right DONT want to segregate them because they want it.\n\nTrying to force me to somehow read others minds in a situation where i couldn't possibly know and making me out to be an asshole and possibly punishing me for it, something that was being widely talked about until trump fucked things up even worse than they were before. More over, another act of 'hate crime done okay' because they ***WANT*** to be called something special and you almost could of been punished for not calling them that even if you didnt know them, it was heavily talked about in 2016. Im sorry, my Trans-dar isnt exactly as strong as my gay-dar which is faulty in itself. Even my minority-dar isnt exactly on point due to all the shades of 'brown' that exist and are eerily similar. so its better i not use any of those dars, right? otherwise i come off as a racist bigot.\n\nAnd i cant help but go back to the above statement about women's rights like abortions, contraceptives, and birth control in general. the left could of AT ANY POINT IN TIME could of made it law but chose not to because it wasnt 'popular enough' and was 'already precedent'. Hell the left had a chance at gun reform/control during Clinton but public backlash made them scared of losing their seats and they distanced themselves from Clinton's reform policies THAT HE HAD TO WRITE HIMSELF and put into presidential  executive order. Something Biden could do AT ANY TIME MIND YOU and just doesn't because 'its an abuse of power' as he has stated... who DIDNT BACK the train unions despite being the most 'pro union' president. and min wage is still at 7.25.\n\nI mean wtf do you want me to tell you, both sides suck. One side sucks slightly less because they arent taking something away from you that you arent aware of yet. Give em time, they'll eventually find a way to take something from you and you'll be upset then as well. But call me a bigot or racist today. Tomorrow it'll be you as well. You shouldn't subjugate the majority to appease the minority, but u shouldnt subjugate the minority either for the sake of the majority. \n\nEdit; and i guess i should say at this point, i do vote blue. Because the Reds have fucking jumped off the deep end. Lesser of two evils and all that jazz.>You can divvy up the blame how you like, but to act like one party is to blame and the other is blameless is absurd to me. You\u2019re willing to sweep the transgressions of democrats under the rug because you believe that, overall, if the country was in their hands, things would be better. I disagree, which, I guess, makes me intellectually lazy\ud83e\udee1\n\nNo one is arguing Democrats are angels, being resentful that there isn't a better choice than Democrats while making no effort to form the better alternative while recognizing that it will likely never achieve viability or relevance in your lifetime, definitely hypocritical laziness.\n\nI can't comment on the situation with Hillary and Wasserman-Schultz, I skipped the Democratic primaries in 2016 and was an Elizabeth Warren supporter, who even to this day still looks more like she'd have been a more viable candidate while Bernie had glaring voting bloc problems that were never sufficiently addressed during that primary and that Bernie voters refuse to admit to the warning signs of even to this day without rerunning a non-Hillary simulated Democratic primary for that year. That one primary, or even the management of the DNC, or even Biden's old positions on crime and gay marriage, are not sufficient evidence to throw out the entirety of its collective Democratic behavior as being the same as Republicans in trying to represent the left's interests.\n\nIt is worse than useless to keep parroting both-sides-ism, it plays strictly into the easily manipulated shitty victim mentality. People don't vote for Democrats to be their cheerleaders, they absolutely should always be holding their noses when they do it but demand to hold the Democratic Party accountable as many times as it takes to, ideally, shut the Republican Party out of being legally allowed to represent anyone in the USA entirely.\n\nTHAT is the only thing that will open enough breathing room for anything other than a two-party system and you STILL run the risk of the country resembling Britain or the EU where pluralities of coalition governments cause even more gridlock than we have now. You need methods other than election cycles to prune bad faith actors, and that's a medium term problem.\n\nThe short term solution isn't necessarily to vote Democratic but it absolutely is to shut up about 'both-sides-ism', that's Nazi-Fascism By Default Surrender. How you personally feel about the Democratic Party is irrelevant when they objectively are still leagues above the GOP and being obstructed by them for decades in bad faith, and your personal experience is also still utterly irrelevant in the face of simply reviewing the legislative history of that party.\n\nYes, Democrats don't rock the boat enough and currently they suffer from the bloat of too many traditional and moderately conservative non-MAGA voters, and those Blue Dog Dems are always dragging them down historically, but if you eliminate the GOP as a viable political and economic institution, guess what? Those voters will quit being the problem you are falsely attributing to both-sides-ism. They would, by definition, filter into actual conservative political parties or other alternatives in the absence of the GOP and distaste for the Democratic policymaking.\n\nThat is, of course, not a simple answer and it takes a long time to do, but there's literally no reason to comment in a political thread if you've given up and are spewing toxic both-sides-ism trolling.> Giving them their own special private places, special bathrooms, special doctors, special everything\n\n> a group suddenly wants to be 'segregated'\n\nWhat *are* you talking about??For your point about \u201ctrans-sat\u201d the issue isn\u2019t about recognizing trans people, it\u2019s more about telling them they shouldn\u2019t exist, or using pronouns that are more inclusive such as \u201cthey\u201d before you do learn what they prefer to be called. No one is calling people making an honest mistake while adjusting an asshole or hate crime committer. They are calling the people that get mad when they are told it\u2019s wrong to treat/talk about trans people as if they shouldn\u2019t exist or something is wrong with them, or somehow take personal offense at the idea that they could help normalize gender neutral language and refer to people the way they would prefer to beOh wow, nevermind, disregard my last question.  This might be the least intelligent both-sides comment I've ever read.> And i cant help but go back to the above statement about women's rights like abortions, contraceptives, and birth control in general. the left could of AT ANY POINT IN TIME could of made it law but chose not to because it wasnt 'popular enough' and was 'already precedent'.

Now we're getting somewhere. Those are good examples of where the Democrats have gone wrong. However, in no way do those examples prove that \"both sides support tyranny\". You've just listed things that the Republicans outright attack and the Democrats are being too weak to defend. \n\nEverything else you said is either complete nonsense or straight right-wing propaganda.Lol don't engage. They are clearly either insane or trolling. It was a funny read though.As said above, if the 'beatings continue until morale improves' the 'both sides do it' dismissive shitters need the financial and cultural beatings the most in that case until their point of view is refined to something actually useful.\n\nRaging in the wind like that toward the world changing in general is worse than useless, it's advertising the ranter as a fucking mark and rube that think they're smarter than everyone else.",

It will hopefully be removed by the courts.\n\n\nRoy Moore tried this and didn't succeed in Alabama. It got him removed from office.It's explicitly against the Texas Constitution. The law won't even survive it's own State Supreme Court.White Nationalist Christian culture warship, go fuck yourselfThis is exactly the intent behind packing the Supreme Court with hard-line Christian extremists. A Christofascist theocracy is the goal, and this is how it starts.I've said it before and I'll say it again: if they're going to allow religious texts/material/imagery in public schools then they either have to allow all of them or not allow any of them at all.Big smile! Big smile!\n\nThe christo-fascists are at it again.  Christianity is in decline in the US.  church attendance has collapsed, only 60% of adults report being christian compared to 95% a few decades ago, and genZ is the least religious generation ever born.  By the time GenZ replaces the boomers and some of GenX, less than 50% of US citizens will belong to any religion.  Putting up the ten commandments might actually accelerate this slide.\n\nI dare Texas to do this.  It won't have the impact they're hoping for.It's my constitutional right not to have the frackin ten commandments in a public school.What about when kids have questions? Like, what is adultery? Or how can I, a girl, covet my neighbor\u2019s wife? This runs afoul of the Don\u2019t Say Gay rule. The paradox creates a fireball. Texas can harness the power of these Balls to solve their energy crisis.Can we stop saying \u201creligious\u201d and start saying \u201cChristian\u201d?Can't believe it's been 21 centuries since the Church started, we have artificial intelligence and palm sized supercomputers and rovers on Mars and yet we're still dealing with this bullshitroberts court is a disgraceyep and once it goes up, the Satanic Temple will sue to get their pillars put up as wellEven if they do, Texas runs into the public prayer case from 2014 and the recent 2022 prayer at public school events.  They have to share time.  If you put the Ten Commandents in a public schools, then if the familes of the local mosque can request the Pillars of Islam installed in classrooms of their school district.  You can't say no to the Muslim families without violating both rulings and the federal establishment clause.  So if Texas lets the Ten Commandments in, you gotta let Mohammad in as well.\n\nI suspet the case has more to do with donor score-card bingo than an actual attempt to put the 10 Commandments into schools.It's interesting and telling that they often go with the 10 commandments.  If the goal was to promote Christianity and instill morality in a positive way, Matthew 7:12 seems like an obvious winner.  The \"Be excellent to each other\" bit.  One of the good passages in that book that most reasonable people would agree with on some level.\n\nThat'd probably be way too liberal, or woke, for them.  It's the opposite of their current behavior and agenda.  Instead, they insist on displaying the more authoritarian 10 commandments, because that's what they are.Are they sure they want kids finding out how shitty their parents and elected officials are?Under His Eye.Thanks to the criminal conservatives on the Supreme Court overturning Roe. We now have everyone of these Red States making as many evil, hateful, dangerous laws as fast as they can. Because you know states rights \ud83e\udd2cWill they put the caveat on it that says the 10 commandments do not have to be observed:\n\nWhen interacting with anyone not of your religion,\nWhen they get in the way of profit. \n\nCause I just want to get the correct commandmentshttps://archive.fo/VT0xaSatanic Temple, do your thing.As a Christian, I am firmly for the separation of church and state. I don't want the Ten Commandments in school. That's what church/Sunday school is for, not public school.It is obvious that those instigating this bill follow neither the Constitution or the ten commandments.Not without equal representation. So the satanic temple gets to list their commandments, and an islamic temple gets to list some of the hadith, and mormons can post something about aliens and god planets or something. That is where this leads. It is all or nothing, which is why currently, it is nothing.The funny thing about all of this shit is that the GOP trying to force-feed religion to the people via the government is probably not going to work out the way they think.  \nLook at what's happening in Iran.  They've had a theocracy for over 40 years.  Multiple studies over the years have shown the general public didn't become more religious, they became less religious. Plus, when you make a government and a religion linked, they are seen by the people as one and the same.  So, if you see the government fucking up and making your lives worse, you're going to start seeing the religion in the exactly same light.  This is why as the protests in Iran have grown and continued, the people aren't just lashing out at the government, they are also lashing out at the Ayatollah, the clerics below him and the state religion of Islam itself.  \nThese are moves of panic.  They see the attendance of churches dropping year after year.  They see the younger generations not identifying with any religious faith.  But all they will accomplish is speeding up this trend and bringing even more loathing and animosity their way.Religion shouldn\u2019t be anywhere but in churchThe Ten Commandments are disloyalty to TRUMP.Can't wait to see how the Satanic Church responds to this.You mean: \"By overturning 247 years of precedent...\"Keep an eye on the many kids who already hate being dragged to church on Sunday. Religion always sets itself on fire, but Trump taught 'em how to fan the flames while they burn. The rats are leaving those arks as fast as they can; this can only serve to raise their top speed.Utah says \"hold my diet coke\"Given that the corrupted supreme court feels as if they can ignore and reinterpret the constitution to fit their personal beliefs there is a good chance this will pass.When you teach kids the Ten Commandments they will also learn they can\u2019t vote for republicans.They want Christian sharia law.hail satan i gyessThe Texas 10 commandments bill is attempting to challenge precedent set by *Stone v Graham* (1980) which was decided based on the landmark case of *Lemon v Kurtzman* (1971) and the resulting \u201cLemon Test\u201d\n\nIn *Lemon v Kurtzman* the justices created a three prong \u201ctest,\u201d establishing that for a law to be considered constitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the law must\n\n> (1) have a legitimate secular purpose\n\n> (2) not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion, and \n\n>(3) not result in an excessive entanglement of government and religion. \n\nIf any prong is violated, the law is unconstitutional. \n\nAs noted in the Court\u2019s opinion, \u201cLemon's 'purpose' requirement aims at preventing the relevant governmental decisionmaker \u2013 here, Congress \u2013 from abandoning neutrality and acting with the intent of promoting a particular point of view in religious matters.\u201d\n\nThe court defined the \u201cprimary effect\u201d prong still further- \u201cWhen the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates that central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the government\u2019s ostensible object is to take sides.\" \n\nThe court modified this prong to help determine if a government action has the effect of promoting or inhibiting a religion- whether it is evident there is government indoctrination, defining the recipients of government benefits based on religion, and \nexamining if there is excessive entanglement between government and religion\n\nIn 1980, Kentucky imposed a law that mirrors the bill that the Texas Senate just passed. The statute required the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments, purchased with private contributions, on the wall of each public classroom in the State. Again, under Burger\u2019s court, the 5-4 majority ruled this unconstitutional, viewed through the lens of the \u201cLemon Test.\u201d\n\nThe majority opinion is resolute: \"This is not a case in which the Ten Commandments are integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like. Posting of religious texts on the wall serves no such educational function. If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments. However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\"\n\nIt would have appeared the matter was settled\u2026 until 2018. \n\nIn 2018, * The American Legion v. American Humanist Association* was presented before the Roberts Court. The case involved the display and maintenance of a large cross on public land (a cemetery) in Maryland. In a 7-2 decision, the court determined the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment clause. The majority opinion, written by Alito, states that although the cross originated as a Christian symbol, it has also taken on a secular meaning. The court further stated that when the *Lemon Test* is applied to religious symbols or monuments, the presumption should be that they are constitutional. The cross and other religious symbols and monuments therefore can be permitted if they serve a secular purpose through their historical importance beyond their admitted Christian origins. \n\n In 2021 during the 87th Legislature, Texas passed SB 797, requiring public schools to display donated signs stating \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d The bill (written by the same senator that crafted Texas\u2019s abortion bounty bill- SB8) is careful to point out the historical significance of the phrase, echoing language used in the *American Leigion* opinion. \n\nThe Texas 10 Commandments bill is not the first attempt to challenge *Stone\u2019s* precedent prohibiting the display of the 10 Commandments, there have been several and prior to 2009, they have all held as unconstitutional. \n\nHowever after the *American Leigion* decision came down and the success of SB 797, Paxton (and others) see blood in the water.\n\n**These proposed  laws are designed to defy the Supreme Court precedents set in our nation  and constitution in hopes they will be challenged in court.** They would likely prevail in Texas\u2019s own conservative state courts but the anticipation is that the plaintiffs would appeal all the way up to a very conservative-friendly Supreme Court. *Lemon* was ruled 8-1, under Chief Justice Warren Burger\u2019s court- widely considered to be the last liberal court to date (also the court that determined Roe v Wade). In contrast, *American Leigion* was ruled 7-2 under Robert\u2019s court, with Ginsberg writing the dissent. \n\n Not only would the ruling likely be at least 7-2 the hope is that the justices might rule as to destroy the precedent set by *Lemon*- dismantling the doctrine designed to preserve the separation between public schools and parochial institutions. \n\nIn short, passing these laws is just a stepping stone to further the goals of the GOP/Federalist Society/Christian Nationalists to steer public dollars to parochial institutions, thereby choking the life out of public schools by diverting their dollars and instituting their view of a nation based on their Christian faith.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Texas\u2019s future on the line.It clearly says in the constitution that ghosts should run thingsNo shit.\n\nThey know exactly what they are doing. Texas and Florida have become ground zero for the fascist White Christian Nationalist movement's attempts to seize power in the US. Where those states go, the rest of MAGA America follows.\n\nOur only hope is that SCOTUS strikes it down. But given their track record recently, they very well may not.>By overturning 50 years of precedent on the separation of church and state, the Supreme Court has opened the door to a flood of religious legislation  \n\n\nAs was intended. This is their game plan. These people want control and they will use any and every means to obtain it and Christianity is the perfect tool.Go for it.  You\u2019ll make more atheists.Just start putting the Islamic Shahada up in schools and the GOP will ban that shit immediatelyIllegal as it is, it\u2019s also ineffective. Do we really think that kids are suddenly all in for god because there is a copy of the 10 commandments on the property? Gimmie a break. I mean, just the fact that conservatives are all worked up about it should be all the evidence you need that it is likely cultural posturing and won\u2019t really affect anyone other than the extremely gullible, at best.\n\nAnd have we forgotten- conservatives don\u2019t want anything except outrage. Let them put the commandments up, no pushback. How long do you think it will be before there\u2019s another problem? And then another? And another? Conservatives crave oppression and victimhood. If their wildest dreams were suddenly fully realized they would still find reasons to shamelessly complain (which would make sense because their wildest dreams are seemingly filled with terrifying fascist hellscapes) \n\nSource- 12 years of Catholic school in the middle of the Bible Belt. Church everyday. Still an atheist. Likely more so thanks to their \u201cteachings\u201d. \n\nPraise GandalfThis is wrong thinking , and this is coming from a Christian. We ( gentiles) were never invited by God to adhere to the Ten Commandments. Unless you were Jewish some 2000 years ago this doesn\u2019t apply to us now . This is just another control others kind of fallen world crap we get from the modern day Pharisees crap we get from the evangelicalsThey might have their way in the short run but in the long run they will fail.  Force feeding Christian dogma to people who want the freedom to think for themselves only ends up breeding more atheists and agnostics.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate for everyone that the pendulum has to swing so far in this direction before right wing religious zealots finally lose this crusade of theirs.\n\nWhen you talk to ultra right wing Christians about their actual beliefs it becomes clear that they\u2019re pursuing a worldview based on their own feelings of frailty and moral failing.  Christianity \u201csaved\u201d them from sin (i.e. from themselves) so therefore it MUST save you too whether you want it or not.\n\nThis is a really bizarre chapter in our history, but it will pass.  Only an ideology in its death throes would attempt such a desperate grasp at power and control over others\u2019 autonomy and thought.\n\nIn a very real sense, it indicates that society has accommodated and placated magical thinking and delusion for far too long.Wait \u2018till schools in Michigan or San Jose start allowing for muslim prayer at school or the wearing of hijabs! Then all these \u201cgood\u201d christians will freak out!I wish they would Secede so we could declare war on them and take their oil then build a fence around it. Right.. that's what they want. Freedumb?I look forward to the Church of Satan\u2019s lawsuitHere\u2019s the issue with putting the 10 commandments in school:\n\nThey\u2019re dumb as hell and make the Christian god seem fake. I wouldn\u2019t show them to anyone. They\u2019re not applicable in high school, or even adult life in 2023. They don\u2019t make sense. \n\nThe Bible is a mess of a book. It\u2019s not good. *It\u2019s for Christians*. I Don\u2019t get what they don\u2019t understand about this. Your entire religion revolves around that book that you probably haven\u2019t read thoroughly, and no one else wants to read it either.I told my kids to let me know if they see this shit. If it shows up, I\u2019m going to tell them to rip it off the wall and destroy it\u2026Doesn\u2019t Texas have their own separate pledge of allegiance?It\u2019s all about \u201cState\u2019s Rights\u201d until they don\u2019t like the bill.FTA:\n\n> Moses is just one of many lawmakers depicted in the court building, including Hammurabi, Solon, Confucius and Muhammad. \n\nWait... the image of Muhammad is depicted on the back wall of the US Supreme Court? Isn't that a major violation of Muslim laws?Big ol\u2019 Red FlagThe short answer is no they can\u2019t. \n\nThe long answer is no they fucking can\u2019t so stop being douchebags and start doing something that will actually help the kids and people of that state.Finally. Something students can graffiti and not feel bad about it.Seems like an ACLU investigation is a good start. They\u2019re going to clog up their courts but , it\u2019s only Texas.Thanks Supreme Court.  You are complicit in allowing the minority to rule the majority.  SCOTUS should have term limits and at least 4 more Justices.  They are no better than any other Politician.  They are political.That's not 50 years of precedent. That's 50 years of the nation acknowledging the clear text of the first amendment. It's like when you call desegregation 50 years of precedent; it should've been longer.These bastards!Precedent doesn\u2019t matter to these far right justices\u2026 no, they understand what the writers of the Contitution really meant as they have time traveling capabilities\n\nAlso, I hope spraypaint sales go up and kids rip these dumb things downDoes that means that every religion should by right be allowed representation?So when they read them in public schools do they just skip right to #2? Because there\u2019s gonna be questions after reading the first two sentences.Ugh, just make all this crazy stop. Hasn\u2019t everyone had enough yet? Do we have to have cruel fascist theocracy while the planet goes into heat convulsions? This is not the future I signed up for, or sacrificed for either. Just O.oIn Utah all public high schools have a Mormon church on site and as an elective students can choose seminary classes. Of course since there is no grade the non Mormon kids can sign up and ditch a period every day.The worst thing about the Ten Commandments is that they're awful. Most of them aren't even moral laws. There are many sources of morality that are superior, such as the fables of Aesop (who was a pagan), Poor Richard's Almanac (Franklin was a deist at best)--hell, even Steven Covey's Seven Habits are a better source of advice on how to live your life.Mine would be in hebrew and a picture of \u201chistory of the world part 1\u201dI always love asking those people who say, \u201cwe need to put god back in school\u201d to tell me about what they remember about god being in school from their youth. They didn\u2019t say morning prayers and see the 10 commandments in classrooms when they were young so I don\u2019t understand how we go \u201cback\u201d to that. It\u2019s evangelical bullshit.>In a subsequent refinement of the Lemon test, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor crafted an endorsement test. It struck down any law that used religion to send the message to some people that they were insiders \u2014 favored members of the political community \u2014 or a message to others that they were outsiders. The Ten Commandments bill would obviously do just that, associating the Judeo-Christian commandments with the official stance of the state of Texas.\n\nThe person who wrote this should have dropped the \"Judeo\" part.  The Ten Commandments fo come from the Old Testament, but the people who push to have them displayed under government authority are certainly not Jewish.  \n\nThey only say \"Judeo-Christian\" as an attempt to shift some of the blame for their theocracy.  \"See?  We're not Christian fascists!  Some of our policies admit Jewish people still exist!\"I have a huge bulletin board in my classroom.  If this passes where I live (my governor has said that she feels \"competitive\" with other republican governors and wants to pass the same bills, so I fear it might) then that board will be plastered with every religion I can find.  Sure, the 10 commandments, but everything else as well.  Nearly a quarter of my students are Muslim, why should they not be represented?  What about my Hindu kids?  Wiccans?  And so on.  It has nothing to do with the standards of 7th grade language arts, but apparently that doesn't matter.Wouldn\u2019t \u201cThou shall not covet they neighbor\u2019s wife.\u201d go against the anti-woke laws against discussing sexuality at all?It's weird that red states are going against one of the top reasons people moved to America. Freedom of Religion.If they let in one religion then they must let in all religions.If they can put of the 10 commandments then they have to put up the pentagram as well.\n\nFreedom of religion means my Satanism holds as much value as your Christianity; if you're represented in public schools then I demand equal representationSmoke & mirror's, never happen.If Texas still wants to secede, i say let them.  Their grid is already disconnected from the nation.  Their red electoral votes won\u2019t be missed.  The US and Mexico can work to block their entry into NAFTA (or whatever the hell it\u2019s called now).  Any bleeding-heart libertarian who identify as Republican will get a free bus pass to the border to emigrate to the Lone Star Society.[deleted]They are obviously just optional suggestions, not biggie if they get ignored.[removed]They can put the words in, maybe not the behaviorsBut, if they allow one religion they have to allow all religions right? So yeah. It\u2019s a problem for them.So what happens when a kid yanks one off the wall? Is it incumbent on a teacher to replace it? What happens if they dont?Sigh. Overturning 50 years of precedent for religious reasons is kind of their jam.Can the statue of Baphomet go up too?Clearly 'constitutional originalism' is a term this joke of a court bandies around when it wants to break precedent, but suddenly they don't care about it when breaching a different precedent.It blows my mind how one parent can get multiple books banned bc it offends them, but if I were to complain about this they would never remove it. The power is given to the people/parents they want it to go to. Talk about discrimination.Most likely outcome - law gets struck in a lower court, Supreme Court declines to hear the case.  But you never know with the Supreme Court these days I guessRepublicans want to connect Church and State from an abortion point of view but can\u2019t see the forest for the trees when it comes to protecting adults and children from the dangers of guns.\n\nI mean it\u2019s one of the big commandments \u201cThou Shalt Not Kill\u201dErhm...the Precedent for the Separation of Church and State goes much further back than 50 years.One of the overlooked issues is that which version of the 10 Commandments very much matters. By picking one (e.g. King James) you are picking and promoting one denomination above all others that use a different translation/numbering.As screwed as this thought process I\u2019m about to relay is, I feel like it would be symbolic of our current situations. Could you imagine the Ten Commandments in a school that suffers a school shooting, and in the aftermath, the commandments tablet would be covered in blood. It\u2019s so f\u2019d that\u2019s what I would think about, but it is a real possibility in where this country\u2019s current climate is at. I\u2019m saddened that everyday life here has routed a thought process to where that\u2019s what a human can draft in their minds. Sad, shameful, disappointing, and scary.Is there anything that says HOW these \u2018donations\u2019 must be displayed?\n\n\u2018Yes Principal Smith, I have hung them all on the wall. What do you mean you can\u2019t see them? Oh, because I hung them up facing the wall? Well yeah I thought we could use the back to display our students essays on the merits of the 1st amendment.\u2019Satan is king, he rules over all so called christian gods. You must worship me. I will transform your government into a strong authoritarian regime. All other religions will be deemed illegal and crushed. Schools must teach our idolism. Women are subservient vessels used to increase our unholy mission. All bow down now and pray.They can only do it if the people let them don\u2019t you think ?And then he almost got reelected after everyone knew he tried to lure teen girls at the mall.if not, I want the seven tenets up in schools as well!!!!The Supreme Court is a worrisome beast, nowadaysIIRC, back in those days, conservatives were trying to just mandate that the 10C were put in schools. That was a clear violation of the 1A.  This Texas thing is a loophole. The government isn\u2019t mandating the 10C be displayed. They are allowing private groups to donate displays, and then mandating schools have to accept them. \n\nIt\u2019s 100% grade-a bullshit, but nothing courts do these days surprise meBut there are courts with Trump appointed judges who may feel the First Amendment is there to protect the Christian minority\u2019s rights. And it\u2019ll take a long time to weave its way to the SCOTUS through appeals. And it\u2019s no sure thing they\u2019d strike it down.Courts, or vandals. Direct action is a strategy for dealing with these kinds of things.Sure they can. Can put it side by side with the Pillars of Islam, as well as the Jewish Principles of Faith!the same courts in Texas that voted to strip the FDA drug approval power because it's for abortion?Until our incestuist GQP led state government amends that law\u2026They'll find a wayBut you would rather have tyranny stripping in schools.>It's explicitly against the Texas Constitution.\n\nAroo! Maybe so. But I know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat.We need Christopher Hitchens to come back to life.It started way before. This is just where it stands. They didn\u2019t come from nowhere. They have been working toward these goals for decades.>allow all of them or not allow any\n\nIsn't this the entire purpose of the Satanic Temple?\n\nThey respond on the defence \"It's not Christian religion we're requiring, we'd allow ***any pray***.\"  At which point the Satanic Temple petition for one of their ceremony's to be included and all the Christians who thought they'd snuck their shit in lose their shit.We tried the not allow any part. It lasted until... 1954. When God got added to the pledge. Shit stayed pretty tame until other religions got jealous and want to be included which made the Christians decide to go hard. \n\nI like your second solution the most, just  gut it out and let your chosen God figure it out later when you aren't on government property. It would be religious chaos to allow inclusion for all recognized religions. Youd never get anything done and it would just be a lawyers wet dream as youd have constant lawsuits for 'infringing' on kids beliefs.No they don't. They *SHOULD*. Don't be confusedWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could all learn about each other\u2019s cultures and religions without a bunch of extremist zealots throwing a hissy fit because they aren\u2019t the sole focus?A challenge for every Texan kid.\nDeface that shit.I am so happy when I see people rejecting this Christian bullshit.I don\u2019t think they expect to win, I think they expect to lose so they can cry foul and complain about being persecuted.  Christians are getting noisier as their numbers decline.The less evangelical christians there are, the more dangerous and extreme the remaining ones will become.what if you covet your neighbor's ass, but not their donkey?I think the unspoken 11th Commandment of Christian Nationalists is \"don't ask questions.\"It also says not to covet your neighbor's manservant and maid servant\u201cFundamentalists\u201dAll religions go this way when they decide they need to be in politics. Look at the Middle East. Heck, look at Sri Lamka where the Buddhists went violent and murderous. The fookin\u2019 *Buddhists*!\n\nWhen religion enters politics, it harms both religion and politics.Fanatic, extremist , cult, \n\n\nAs a person who has zero faith in the Christian religion or any other Abrihamic religion, it fucking scares the shit out of me. My kids are not Christians.  These signs have got to be illegal. Unless I can put up our religious doctrine too.  Which is nobodies business.Nah, they all want this same thing, to control other peoples actions.\u201cDevils is what they are\u201dBecause real Christianity is based on the new testament of the bible, which religious conservatives go out of their way to either ignore or contradict. The 10 commandments are deemed null and void as per the new testament and Jesus' FINISHED work at the cross. They don't like to admit that it's true. Every Christianity offshoot goes out of their way to keep you in bondage from the truth. Make you submit and confess your sins, as if they weren't already forgiven completely already.\n\nI study the bible in my spare time and it angers me that religious people don't seem to do so.the Robert's court is an ongoing crime-spree.These?  :  https://thesatanictemple.com/blogs/the-satanic-temple-tenets/there-are-seven-fundamental-tenetsThis is the second version of the bill the first said donated religious sayings.  The satanic temple stated they were seeking artists for plaques of the tenants to donate.  The bill got pulled and rewritten to explicitly stated plaques of the 10 commandments.  This is more than hitting a mark for bingo.Bill and TedBlessed be the fruitFrom the shadowsTo be fair, half of the commandments aren't bad and largely are illegal to do even outside of religious concepts. Its only the stupid ones that are dumb;\n\nThou shall not kill, pretty based. \n\nHonor thy mother and father, kinda cringe if you got shit parents not gonna lie. \n\nThou shall not steal, again pretty solid. \n\nThou shall not covet, I don't see why Ted gets a nice mower and I can't go buy one equal or greater than his. Its a quality piece of hardware but I'm sure I could buy one of similar stature and maybe my lawn will look as good if not better than teds. \n\nRemember the sabbath, kinda hard to know which day that is as religions can't seem to decide due to the Gregorian calender we follow to date but a good chunk of people don't work or go to school on the weekends so well call that a happy accident. Also not a punishable crime. \n\nTaking the lords name in vein, largely is a crime as saying God damnit is technically a crime in public, though more for the damn and less for the God part.\n\nFalse idols and not putting God first... bit of a red flag and both kinda are the same yet they felt it bared repeating twice in different words. Unnecessary imo. \n\nAdultery, not a crime but it is pretty low to do to anyone. And can get you in some hot civil suit legal troubles in the divorce so its basically a half law. \n \nBareing false witness aka lying. Also not cool and can get you in some serious hot legal issues if you do it in a bad way.\n\nSee, like half are kinda cool.religion shouldn't be anywhere except in solitary situations. \n\ngods dont need anyone speaking for them. they can do that all on their own. privately. \n\nbut honestly, if you're hearing voices... seek help.Just fyi, it\u2019s called The Satanic TempleTrump supporters being holier than thou is the exact reason my 60+ year old parents no longer go to church. \n\nThey were the straw that broke the back.Silver lining. When you got everyone in Texas staring at these Ten Commandants that are oh so Big Deal, prayer in Texas schools, and then they look around at the unabated, unpunished violence, corruption, sex scandals, etc, by the same politicians thats no doubt loudest in church, you got future generations realizing Texas \u2018Christianity\u2019 dont mean shit.This also creates endless convenient distractions from the real issues that need addressed.> Then all these \u201cgood\u201d christians will freak out!\n\nand their legislators will simply pass a law saying only the ten commandments can be displayed.  And who is going to argue about what Republicans do?  Republicans are being given free reign to do whatever.  No real protest against it.Florida Man is a thing. Look at Ron Desantis getting bent over by an animated mouse. In a court battle to be paid for by Florida residents. \n\nTexas can handle theocratic turds just fine.Just fyi, it\u2019s called the satanic templeProb not a good idea. A student strike may be better. They are just gonna penalize your kid and be all smug about putting up a new one.Republicans plan to limit the USA to one religion.  The Christian Religion.\n\nDon't think it can happen?\n\nSo far the USA Leaders are letting all these other horrible Republican law changes occur and simply shrug their shoulders.Great idea, but for the fact that my son and his family live in west Texas.  With every step backward these assholes dimming the life prospects of my four brown skinned Texas born granddaughters.They already do.

Somehow, I see these very straightforward but milquetoast statements as bringing more controversy than keep the Sabbath, which is very undefinedThe same way they tried to do the \"We're not prosecuting abortion providers, but we're letting anyone who wants sue them! See, it's not the government doing it so you can't stop us!\"[Here is the text of the law](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB01515I.htm). Apparently, \"shall\" can sometimes be construed as \"may\" (meaning it's not a requirement). So the law is saying schools can display these posters. Look at section d of the law. It's saying if a classroom doesn't have a poster, they have to accept a donation and display it. I'm pretty sure the donation thing is a way to force the hand of schools who choose not to display them.Or just makes up a reason why it's A-OK to be the christian taliban.It's why I left Texas. Love the land, Hate the people.Soon they\u2019ll have underwear stripping in schools. Gotta be sure you\u2019re not trans!Yes!

Christian extremists think about this all the time, and I mean, all the time.

One at a time is totally cool.If I recall correctly this is the second version of the bill written in slreaponse to the satanic temple stating it would be donating plaques.  In response I believe the law was changed so it had to be the commandments not any scripture forcing it to be only the Christian commandments.Stone v GrahamHold up.

So, he's actually a piece of garbage like the rest of the conservatives who want to protect child marriage,  just not QUITE as big of a piece of garbage as one ad by a super PAC made him out to be, in the eyes of an Alabama jury, made up of a grouping of the same 48 percent or so of voters who happily voted for that piece of shit.Hey, i resemble that remark.UU is the Seven Principles.

So sure, if you allow one you should allow all.No worries :)Treasonous*Sister Stormy Daniel\u2019s, Our Lady of the Sullied Strap-on, bray for us.Just draw weiners on itI've been trying to get them to move to New York (the ancestral homeland of us Puerto Ricans).It's really not, we've got a hundred years of peer reviewed science (really much, much, much more but like with everything, non-white people don't count in this discussion.)\n\nJust a reminder, trans white women were not only around in the 1920s, they had more rights than black men and fewer rights than white men, meaning even your great grandpa statistically was less of a transphobe than you.Childrenery if you want to be semantic.nice workaraound! LOLThe Golden Trump statue at CPAC proved that.It\u2019s democratic super PAC, not democrat. Jeez.I\u2019m not trying to argue or anything but I just don\u2019t understand how those are two different things? Repeatedly hitting on underage employees seems extremely similar to soliciting for sex from minors. I\u2019m certainly no lawyer but I\u2019m assuming it probably had something to do with the provably of solicitation? My understanding of words is that hitting on minors and soliciting for sex from minors is the same damn thing. Also where the fuck is the need for 8 million to compensate for an ad?Thank you. I joined the Satanic Temple, and am apart of UU homeschooling umbrella. The two philosophies go pretty well together.Yes, and they both start with recognizing another person as equal no matter what ethnicity, creed, or gender. Each seems to me a better place to start than worship this lone god. Something that was written when a leader was trying to unify his community who had been under several polytheistic rulers.The political landscape sure is, but the ecological one contains everythingI don't think that's a new development...\"well the public schools aren't operating properly so it's in the children's best interest that we institute voucher programs.\n\nIt's totally just for the children. Yep.\"We need parents to stay home. General strike. \n\nHow is this system still going when none of it is working? \n\nAnd none of it working is by design?The bible as we know it is a mashup of several different texts across two distinct faiths, combining historical records, the Pentateuch, a bunch of letters arguably from the same guy, mystical writings, and ostensibly first-hand accounts of the life of Jesus Christ, aka the Gospels.\n\nIt went through numerous revisions and recompilings over the centuries, with several books being included by very narrow margins, or excluded altogether.\n\nSo, while the bible as we know it didn't exist until well after the crucifixion, some of the constituent parts- specifically the Jewish ones, were already ancient.Pretty sure he def. wouldn't be about the giant worship services... since he kinda spoke on that specifically IIRC.\n\nAnd the whole \"why are you so fucking hung up on my execution device\" thing.Yeah pretty sure Lot's daughters got him blackout drunk and raped him.Totally different court.  This current court ignored the facts in Kennedy v Bremerton to rule in favor of the coach who was coercing participation in his prayers.  This current court doesn't give a fuck about precedence.  It only cares about achieving the christofacist goal of a Christian nation.This is the wayMy wife and I took a trip to PR a few years ago.  Our families were asking if our passports were in order and to make sure we had the phone number of the US embassy there (\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f).I'd never accuse a republican of being antisemanticAnd the bible doesn't say anything against that!Apologies,  a super PAC supportive of the democrat party candidate for the Senate seat.[removed]Also not a lawyer. Jury trial, all I can say is his lawyer was able to get whatever amount of jurors needed to agree with his arguments thst he was defamed. No clue if the judge or jury set the damages. Doesn't exonerate him in my mind. If he was technically correct, it doesn't mitigate him being a POS in my mind.I'm a big fan of both. I affectionately refer to the Satanic Temple as \"secular humanism for theater kids.\"You should check out cali.It's similar to \"government doesn't work, elect us (conservatives) and we'll prove it!\"Not to mention every rich person who\u2019s in a position of power or those who have mega churches would probably piss Jesus off something tremendous. I legit believe if Jesus had his second coming rn on live international tv that conservatives would say he\u2019s a false prophetYep! That wasn't long after him offering his daughters to the crowd, in exchange for the supposed angels.Which is exactly what the old perv *would* have claimed after raping his daughters.Take my r/angryupvoteLol it's actually the Democratic party.  There is a small group of people who use democrat party as an insult and an even smaller group of people who get offended by it.If me saying a grown man hitting on underage girls is a shit human isn't worth listening to, then so be it.I live in a very rural conservative area. \"Democrat\" is extremely common here and it is the only thing I grew up with. it was interchangeable. So I would be very leery of judging people by that because I'm definitely not conservative and use it.Yeah, makes sense. Agreed, I think he was 30 something at the time. I also don\u2019t understand how conservatives have *this* many criminals running for public office, and many are these type of criminals mind you, but wouldn\u2019t change their vote despite voting for trash. Solely because of party affiliation, it\u2019s fucking stupid.[removed]Ah. As a life long dem voter I was getting confused over what the issue was. So, a semantic mistake that in no way takes away from my main point on the subject. Or at least, l would hope it wouldn't.I\u2019m curious what you found homogenous about california\u2019s landscape. I can go from mountains to desert to beach all in one day, and that\u2019s just in socal. Up north you have coastal redwoods.  A forest on a beach! \nThe central valley is pretty boring, but i\u2019ve never heard california described as homogeneous.Uhhh\u2026 homogeneous? I\u2019m not trying to discount your own experience but Cali has the most different climates/biomes in one state (lower 48) by a long shotYeah I also don't understand people's obsession over it.  I think it's a generational thingCalifornia viewed as a whole has a lot of nice and different areas. California viewed as what a person can actually and reasonably visit in a day is sections of thousands of square miles of exactly the same landscape, same tree, same color, same houses. Individual spots are idyllic, but viewed holistically the area is monotone and once you've been at the spot for an hour you've seen what literally every other spot in the whole 1000+ sq mi looks like.That's a claim all large states say. Texas spouts the same shit. \n\nWhat makes California homogenous is the extreme lack of biodiversity. You may have many different sections, but every section is the same from corner to corner of it. Same tree, Same grass, same development. It's boring and homogenous to visit.Sounds like Texas.No, it\u2019s not Calis claim, it\u2019s just true. I\u2019m not sourcing that from CaliTourismAwesome.net or whatever you\u2019re thinking of. 40% of all plant species there don\u2019t exist outside of its borders and in no world is the ecology of the southern deserts/ alpine mountains the same as NorCal.Nah, Texas has biodiversity. There are pockets of boring, but the ecological variety means even if you spend all day in exploring as much as you can in a car you still won't see all the different views and vegetation the area has to offer.\n\nThe whole West Coast suffers from the Content Aware Fill issue.You've made two claims that don't actually correlate with each other. The number of unique plant species has nothing to do with the differences in biomes over a large geographic area like California. Again, the same shit is true about Texas. It contains all but one geographic biome and also has a large number of species both flora and fauna that exist only in Texas. \n\nYou are unintentionally sharing your California and California Government social studies education.  I'm helping you understand the claim is not unique.\n\nAs for North vs South... no shit, never said it wasn't.  Slow down, remove some of your \"state pride\" from the table, and actually read what is being written. It'll stop you from being blocked in the future.",

Perry\u2019s attorneys argued Perry shot Foster five times through his car window in self-defense. An activist on the street that night, however, told Truthout that Foster couldn\u2019t have raised his rifle and put himself in between Perry\u2019s car and his quadruple-amputee wife, Whitney Mitchell, who is Black, to protect her. \"\n\nYeah. No shit it's backfiring. The entire case is open and shut, but this little racist thinks he let the perpetrator get away with it because he is governor.The more vile you are, the more Republican fascists love you.>The presentation is likely to take place after Perry\u2019s official sentencing, which could be scheduled after a May 3 hearing in the case, during which a Travis County state district judge will determine whether to grant Perry a new trial. Defense attorneys filed a motion for a new trial on April 11, alleging that the court erred in excluding key evidence they say shows Foster and protesters were the \u201cfirst aggressor,\u201d not Perry.\n\nThat totally sounds like someone who didn't intend to drive in to a crowd of protesters.\n\n\n>The unsealed evidence also shows Perry initiating an inappropriate exchange with a 16-year-old girl on the Kik instant messaging platform after searching \u201cgood chats to meet young girls.\u201d He first warned the apparent minor not to send him nudes \u201cuntil you are old enough to be of age\u201d and later told her, \u201cI am going to bed come up with a reason why I should be your boyfriend before I wake up.\u201d\n\n\nOh, and he's grooming a minor.The racists want permission to kill BLM and antifa protesters without consequence.\n\nContrary to the beliefs of bigots like Abbott, most people support the right to protest and they want to rein in the police.What gets me is that the murder victim was also a veteran \u2026 but the GOP is mum on that.Being able to pardon someone who has been convicted of murder is absolutely crazy. This is way too much power for an individual to have. Yes, there is a board between the Governor and the pardon, but how are these board members picked?The board doesn't even recommend pardons until December. If Abbott makes him too famous those are going to be a tough 8 months.I\u2019m literally begging you to stop referring to this guy by his military rank.It won't backfire because Abbott appoints the board and while he can pressure them to issue a pardon, he can also pretend to defer to them and make them take all the MAGA death threats when they decline to issue a pardon.\n\nSo yeah, it's good that his conviction is upheld, but he will tell the MAGA faithful that he did all he could and that dirty, scheming, Soros-backed parole board (of his appointees) conspired to keep him in jail and they will eat it up.Those text exchanges clearly show who the party of groomers is\u2026 gross.\n\n> The unsealed evidence also shows Perry <the man governor Abbot wants to pardon> initiating an inappropriate exchange with a 16-year-old girl on the Kik instant messaging platform after searching \u201cgood chats to meet young girls.\u201d He first warned the apparent minor not to send him nudes \u201cuntil you are old enough to be of age\u201d and later told her, \u201cI am going to bed come up with a reason why I should be your boyfriend before I wake up.\u201dHe probably doesnt know what to do since they fired his boss TuckerCould this little pervert racist Perry become Abbott's Willie Horton?How are they still allowed to be referred to by their military service when they\u2019ve lost the respect of the nation they\u2019re meant to protect?Even \"liberal\" news sources can't help themselves from referencing the murderer's military service and rank while ignoring the victim's.Thank fuck!What his plan to pardon a convictor murder who after he made the claims it was released that he had be writing about wanting to kill protesters, and had a lot of racist texts. And then the cherry on top the shit cake was this loser trying to make sexual advances on a child.Conservatives claim to be the party of law and order and claim democrats are soft on crime.  Here this guy was convicted of murder and Abbott is telling everyone how he's going to pardon a convicted murderer.  Backfire?  I fucking hope so.Red meat for the rednecks that continue to vote him in.I wonder if Abbott will learn from Desantis\u2019 mistakes. It\u2019s easier to just talk and get voters excited\u2026 but leaning into a very specific person/company/entity can really backfire. There\u2019s just so much political risk. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s still doing this. He would be better off just ignoring this now and pretending like he never supported this.Backfire? That would imply there are consequences. Abbott won\u2019t face any consequences.Ya think?!Here comes the federal gov to charge him with hate crimes!Why does this guy keep getting voted into power??!!It is already backfiring. Abbott is short sighted manHe will do it anyway.Abbott is a complete fool who doesn\u2019t have a critical thought in his brain.I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the parole and pardon board suddenly finds so many other cases to work on they can\u2019t find the time to get to this one.Don't forget the recent revelation that Perry was exchanging inappropriate text messages with underage girls.> put himself in between Perry\u2019s car and his quadruple-amputee wife, Whitney Mitchell, who is Black, to protect her. \"\n\nDid some Googling since I hadn't really followed this case too closely and wasn't aware of the details. Knowing more about this woman and their relationship makes the whole situation so, _so_ much more tragic. The personal situation of the person who was murdered shouldn't really matter, but the fact that he was such a sympathetic figure makes it seem all that much more likely that pardoning the murderer would be received poorly.\n\n> Mitchell and Foster met when they were 17 and living in the Dallas area. They attended different high schools but met through a friend and bonded via MySpace over their shared identities as \u201cemo kids,\u201d as Mitchell describes it. Within a year, he\u2019d proposed to her, with a toy ring, because that\u2019s all he could afford. Also within the first year of their relationship, she underwent a life-changing illness and infection that resulted in the amputation of both her legs and arms. \u201cIt was a really rough time,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in a coma and Garrett stayed through the whole thing\u2026every day, every night. There wasn\u2019t a point where he wasn\u2019t there.\u201d While Mitchell re-learned how to walk and function in the wake of her surgeries, he enlisted in the Air Force to earn money to support them. After his honorable discharge around 2011, he became her full time caregiver. ([Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/wife-murdered-blm-protester-garrett-foster-whitney-mitchell-interview-1234713271/))\n\nGoing through all of that, then watching her husband get shot dead right in front of her...>An activist on the street that night, however, told Truthout that Foster couldn\u2019t have raised his rifle\n\nI know both the parties already agree he didn't point his weapon at Perry but what is this referring to? That he was too close to the car or something?You are so right.Until you're not vile enough... under the bus you go.>\tOh, and he\u2019s grooming a minor\n\nSo predictable at this point\u2026>Oh, and he's grooming a minor.\n\nWell failed to groom a minor. Said minor burned him hard when he said:\n\n>him: \"So why an old man like me.\"  \n>  \n>her: \"Wym\"  \n>  \n>her: \"I don't want u\"Grooming children, sounds like your average Republican.The most \"positive\" spin on this I'm capable of coming up with: *No nudes is good news*.[removed]They want permission to kill _all_ protesters, \"BLM\" and \"Antifa\" are just silly little labels they sort _everything_ through.\n\nProtesting for union or higher wages? Antifa. Protesting for prison reform? BLM. Protesting for green policy? Antifa. Protesting on behalf of immigrants? BLM.and quite publicly libertarian  \n\n\nkinda fucks up their narrativeIt's simple: their job depends on the appointment and goodwill of the governor. Obviously they're impartial.It really isn't crazy. It is a valuable option when poor, black, and/or mentally disabled people are railroaded into murder convictions, which happens a lot.Our buddy Schwarzenegger granted clemency to a cold blooded killer on the last day of his second term. Amazing coincidence that the killer was the son of the most powerful Democrat in the state at the time. I live in San Diego and this was a low blow. https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/us/arnold-schwarzenegger-clemency/index.htmlYeah, \u2018groomer of 16 year old girls\u2019 is also an accurate way to refer to him.>truthout.org/articl...\n\nAbsolutely, while never providing in the same headline that the man he murdered was a veteran.[deleted]This deserves more upvotes.Doubtful.  The MAGA Reality Interference Shield will filter news to the base that indicates that the shooting was justified and the Governor is doing the just thing.especially when they killed a fellow servicemember, intentionally, and yet the victim keeps getting called a protestor. I feel like intentional blue on blue is at least the scenario where we 100% end the practice of acknowledging the perps \u2018service\u2019.Conservatives want protesters to be killed. The entire point was Republicans signaling that they would protect anyone that killed left-wing citizens.State dems will draft a strongly-worded letter requesting that the action be formally condemned.[removed]He was pushing his wife around in a wheelchair afaik, he didn\u2019t have the free hands, especially since a car was driving towards them and he tried to get her out of the wayIt refers to the fact that the shoulder strap Foster used to open-carry his rifle was too tight, and that he had to remove it entirely in order to point and aim the weapon. This is discussed further down in the article.It's like potential energy, the worse you are, the more you can be forgiven by godAnother one: Perry doesn\u2019t do book readings in drag to children.Yes.  It is like the label \u201cwoke.\u201d  These words are intended to create some boogeyman triggers that stoke hate on the right.And perceived a threat because of open carryReality fucks up their narrative.How often do we see those cases? I feel like pardons used the way you're describing -while good for those individuals- is like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. Without addressing the underlying railroading, the pardon sits there as a nebulous \"might help you, but probably not\" concept. A concept that is used as the personal \"get my friends out of jail\" to be used be certain powerful politicians only.\n\nThe concept of the pardon reminds me of capricious \"mercy\" given by the King. America doesn't have kings, at least it's not supposed to.They almost never mention the man he murdered was also a veteran.I don't think that's possible anymore.  Media is running with the story, and the child groomer stuff is something Abbott isn't going to be able to justify even to his base.\n\nEither going to have to say \"well, morally he's an asshole but LEGALLY pardoning him is the right thing to do\" and take the heat, or more likely just have the pardon board quietly say he doesn't qualify and let it go.\n\nEither way, he fucked up opening his mouth before he knew what was in those messages.[deleted]Don't need to. The article covers it.From the article that this post is about:\n\n>The unsealed evidence also shows Perry initiating an inappropriate exchange with a 16-year-old girl on the Kik instant messaging platform after searching \u201cgood chats to meet young girls.\u201d He first warned the apparent minor not to send him nudes \u201cuntil you are old enough to be of age\u201d and later told her, \u201cI am going to bed come up with a reason why I should be your boyfriend before I wake up.\u201dRead the article.You're literally commenting on that.From the article:\n\n> The unsealed evidence also shows Perry initiating an inappropriate exchange with a 16-year-old girl on the Kik instant messaging platform after searching \u201cgood chats to meet young girls.\u201d He first warned the apparent minor not to send him nudes ***\u201cuntil you are old enough to be of age\u201d and later told her, \u201cI am going to bed come up with a reason why I should be your boyfriend before I wake up.\u201d***Are you still reading the article or just refusing to admit you didn\u2019t and got caught?Defending a murderer is actually a new low on Reddit. CongratulationsI agree with the sentiment, but it's in the article linkedWoah, was Perry shooting over that dude's wife when aiming at him?> and the child groomer stuff is something Abbott isn't going to be able to justify\n\nNot to be too cynical but have you seen the people they support? Lauren Boebert married a pedophile, Roy Moore *is* a pedophile, Trump is a racist that wants to fuck his own daughter, Matt Gaetz is also a pedophile, and those are just the ones off the top of my head.\n\nEdit: meant to type \"Trump is a rapist\" but it's still true so I'm leaving itUh, conservatives don't actually care about proteacting kids. It is just something that they claim to attack LGBT+ people.\n\nDonald Trump reportedly would walk in  the changing rooms where minors were getting ready for pageants.\n\nAnd Ron DeSantis went to parties with his students when he taught high school.\n\nThese are the two front runners for the next Republican nnominee. Republican voters clearly don't care about protecting kids.You're right, my mistake. They'll need to ask the state GOP if they're allowed to get mad.Looks like he just qualified to be a Republican presidential nominee.I don\u2019t know, it could be that once the car stopped he got between her and the car.At minimum a seat in the houseOr a UN weapons inspectorOr at least a night with MTG and maybe an \"internship\"",

Specifically, the Republican plan is to require people receiving Medicaid to prove they are working or taking steps toward finding a job or training for one. In practice, this means they must fill out a bunch of additional complicated paperwork to keep getting their insurance.\n\n\n>Arkansas experimented with this policy under the Trump administration. The result was a failure, at least by the policy\u2019s stated goal of encouraging unemployed people to get jobs. It \u201cdid not increase employment over eighteen months of follow-up,\u201d a study found, but it did cause people to lose their health insurance, because they weren\u2019t aware of the work requirements or didn\u2019t know how to navigate them. As a result, they delayed care, skipped medication, and had higher levels of medical debt.\n\n\n>The CBO estimates, in fact, that of the 15 million Americans subject to the work requirement, some 1.5 million would fail. But it further estimates that 900,000 of those people would keep their coverage because they reside in states that care enough about them to shell out for their Medicaid; the remaining 600,000 reside in states sufficiently indifferent to their fate to let them simply go uninsured.\n\n\nHow does anyone not see this as evil? They tried and it didn't work.This is American Christo-fascism. This coup has been 70 years in the making - and they are a breath away from ending all pillars of democracy, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and human rights. The Republican party are a death cult that have fostered daily mass murders in the USA. Unite, organize and mobilize: defy them and defend democracy.\u201cFuck the People!\u201d -Republican Party mottoAnd the Republicans who would no longer have health care will laugh in the face of the libs.Run the country into the ground, blame it on the Democratic President. That's the Republican way.\n\nAs Mitch McConnell once loosely said, \"If the bill was so bad, why didn't Obama warn us?!\". Mind you, this was after he vetoed it and the Republican controlled Congress overrode his veto.https://archive.fo/BxfM5They don\u2019t care about their base at allJust remember! Vote \u2018em out!Just 600K?  Wow, the GOP must be off their game.Republican voters have proven to be so uninformed of actual facts that they do not care until something is taken away or something is provided and they find it to be beneficial. 2 recent examples are the Affordable Care Act & Abortion...Now the GOP wants to take away SS, medicare, medicaid and their voters are falling in line...Turns out the Death Panels were inside the House all along.Republicans are really running with that motto \"God helps those who help themselves\".Some [truths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-usmvYOPfco&ab_channel=AlanGrayson) are perennial.I\u2019m positive this is just an oversight. No one could ever be this dumb./sIdiotic ideas from the idiotic Republican party.TrashyThe fun part would be to calculate how many of those 600,000 would end up not paying their medical bills when they go to the hospital. Likely we would end up paying just as much in higher hospital costs due to non-payment as the insurance we are providing. We are paying for these people either way.How the fuck do they keep getting majority? God damn its like leaving 5 year Olds home alone with a gas can and a book of matches. Grow the fuck up and pass a clean bill for God's sake.I think there\u2019s a belief in the GOP that you should only get healthcare if you can pay for it directly or through private insurance. \n\nIf you can\u2019t it\u2019s your fault and you deserve to be sick and die. There\u2019s something wrong with you if you can\u2019t spend thousands of dollars on insurance and/or healthcare (you\u2019re lazy and contemptible), and or God is punishing you, and you don\u2019t deserve help. \n\nIt\u2019s not a \u201cthere, but for the grace of God, go I\u201d approach, it\u2019s more like eugenics, where less desirable people die and are no longer around consuming resources. The Nazis put the sick and those with disabilities in gas chambers. I think the goal is the same, but the methods aren\u2019t as fast.They do not care. Nobody is gunna go after them for it, they will go unchallenged as they are surrounded by riot police.America. The land of unlimited money apparently. Crazy how everyday there is a new example showing how both parties are the same, and fish go the benefit of all American, at least the ones who want to stop fascism, to vote for democratsBut rich people need more money so they can give us  contributions and lobby thrn give us future cushy jobs .The party of human miseryY'all get health insurance?Cruelty is always the pint w repugsMostly poor republicansSo what if you are self-employed and still don't make enough? These people need to realize poverty is a feature of capitalism not a moral failure. Republicans are a disease in this country. \"Fuck you I got mine!\" while pulling up the ladder behind them.I remember that - truly horrifying.> September 13, 2011 Tea Party Debate Audience Cheered Idea of Letting Uninsured Patients Die\n\nwhat the f-. Total bloody psychopaths.Precursor of Maga.The republicans are the party of chaos: overindulgent excess, grotesque sloth and love of disease, self-destructive scheming, and blood for the blood godThat\u2019s right around when the Republicans started yelling about \u201cdeath panels\u201dThe irony is a lot of those who cheered ended up being the ones dyingI used to be a huge fan of Ron Paul and I might have even applauded this at the time. The biggest thing that he and most libertarians seem to underestimate is corporate greed. There isn't enough giving and altruism in society to overcome the insatiable greed of corporations. So in the 60s churches may have been able to provide healthcare to those that couldn't afford it, but now it would be way too expensive to do so. Not to mention they'll simply turn away people they don't feel are \"Christian enough\".Sept 13, 2011 Tea Party activists cheer for letting their party members die needlessly.It's an evil that goes back a very long way.\n\n>2 Thessalonians 3:10  \n>*For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: \"If a man will not work, he shall not eat.\"*\n\nFortunately some states do understand the importance of overcoming *The Tragedy of the Commons*.Here's another statistic: conservatives are 38% of registered voters, vs. over 50% of non-conservative voters.\n\nWe keep the death-panel fascists in power by not voting.Multiple GOP members mentioned this as needed to provide \u201cincentives\u201d for people to work. That it will \u201cbreak the cycle of poverty\u201d by forcing people to work minimum wage jobs.\n\nThey should use that same moral compass and raise taxes on the billionaire bunch to give them an \u201cincentive\u201d to pay their fair share.\n\nBut of course it\u2019s easier to talk down to and harass poor people than billionaires.  All they will be doing is increasing the ranks of the working poor. Bonus cruelty for adding people 50-55.>evil? They tried and it didn't work.\n\nOh, but it ***did*** work!\n\n-\n\nNever pay any attention to the GOP's ***stated*** goal.  \n\nThat's just a lie for marketing.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nThey know people suffered, and that's what they wanted.\n\n-\n\nBonus Points: they know that those who suffered most were in red states.\n\nIt doesn't bother them, they will blame Democrats.As Bill Maher said, Supply Side JesusThat makes zero sense, Christ was a health care worker who healed the sick and fed the poorStrangely enough, they seem to be opposed to legalizing sex work.\u201cIncluding us!\u201d ~Republican votersnah just fuck the poor people> \"God helps those who help themselves\".\n\n-- to all of the lobbyists' moneyExcept televangelists, those guys really need a hand!\n\n-\n\nOh, and churches during COVID relief - they need all the public's money!You're right, they were hoping to take healthcare away from at least a million people.  I'm sure they will correct this oversight with an amendment.Well, if they want to help, I know of least 635 of them and their families who can give it up and it would add up to 2 or 3 percentYes, they will let neglect and starvation work their murders for them.These types of cuts and proposals are for the budget. Pushing this for the debt ceiling is unconstitutional.Both parties are not the sameTheir sociopathy is starting to hurt them in the gun debate too. They lack all self awareness so it\u2019s in full display. \n\nEven here on Reddit they always expose themselves trying to justify dead kids.[removed]They want your tax dollars going to the church not the government. They want the church to run our communities take your taxes and tell you to fuck off.\n\nThe right isn\u2019t into Jesus there into organized (crime) religion.  It is full of bureaucracy and a top down organization where no one questions the top. Because you know god.  \n\nIE religious fascism where old white dudes lie about fantasies and steal your money.They are just being good followers of supply side Jesus and making sure those poors reach their salvation sooner. /SAnd some will be like [Trevor.](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/jonathan-m-metzl-dying-whiteness/)Paul was an asshole. No surprise there.You are thinking of Middle Eastern Jesus of Nazareth. \n\nRepublicans pray to White Jesus.Point out the difference between a sex-worker and a GOP pol.\n\n-\n\nSex-workers, don't have health insurance, might not lie to youYeah, but they can't threaten to destroy the country's economy once the debt ceiling is raised. Their majority is too small in the House and they don't control the Senate, so they won't get anywhere. \n\nI hate to say it but our best bet is to call their bluff and not negotiate here. Maybe hope a couple moderate Republicans help the Democrats lift the debt ceiling. They aren't playing by the rules and so we have to let them destroy the country if thats what they intend to do.Not only that, but 'both sides are the same' snarkers need some financial penalties. Jobs and entitlement losses for example, until their rhetoric is focused into something actually useful and reality-based.Yes, the comment was supposed to be absurd.I read that as they always expose themselves to kids and am not sure I read it wrong...I don't recall that ever actually being in the bible. There was something about giving to others, but I could be wrong /sThis is exactly what Ron Paul said in the article OP posted. He said the churches should take people in. No one should be trusting those rapey bastards.Yup read \"Dying of Whiteness\" during lock down and recently finished \"The Racist Fantasy\"\n\nPicked up \"They Thought hey Were Free\"(because this is where parts of society are right now)\n\nIt's so fucked up all of this is happening because they can't accept the reality of others existing outside themselves.First he attacked Christianity. Then he infiltrated it and brought back patriarchy and other BC practices he liked.Not arguing your point and I\u2019m not a Christian  but 2 Thessalonians was most likely not written by Paul, but was written by someone else in his name to give it more credibility. There are only 7 undisputed letters of Paul in the New Testament according to the prevailing view among scholars, and there is a lot of debate about 2 Thessalonians due to writing style and theological themes that are different from Paul\u2019s undisputed letters.JeezusGuess the question is if they are hell bent on letting the debt default wouldn\u2019t that fuck everyone equally?Yay!!!! Let\u2019s go for $100 trillion dollars! Surely we can start giving away more cash to people who do virtually nothing!>God helps those who help themselves\n\nIronically, the phrase appears to originate in ancient Greece.\n\n\"The gods help those who help themselves.\"There's no actual evidence, for many of the apostles, that they were real people. And every gospel was written by someone else long after the supposed apostle died. The Bible is not a historical document.Not historically accurate at least, more so a series of compromises over a couple hundred years. Seems it was a political book and continues to be at current. Early church history is truly fascinating though.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*Trump, when faced with the first real (non-self inflicted) crisis of his administration, first decided to deny reality, then decided to make a reality show out of it and finally ended up being hospitalized. \n\nI understand not everybody loves Biden, but even if he sat in the oval office all day and did nothing but pick lint out of his bellybutton he'd still be a better president than Trump.I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll vote for a brick wall if it means trump doesn\u2019t become presidentSee trump lose again? I'm in.If Trump couldn't beat Biden in 2020, before the whole Jan 6th incident and before becoming inundated in criminal investigations, what chance does he have now? \n\nTrump might as well be a spoiler candidate set up by Democrats. He is liked enough to fracture the party, but not enough to win against Joe. He will also have a tough time campaigning, going in and out of court houses too.They are both way to old for the job. I don\u2019t understand this country anymoreTrump is the evil of two lessers.\n\nOnce again I will be forced to vote AGAINST tRump.Joe Biden is America\u2019s detox from Donald Trump. We apparently need four more years of normalcy. It\u2019s certainly better than anything the Republican Party has to offer.For all the gnashing of teeth about how everyone hates these two, it'd sure be nice if any of them could manage an actual alternative. It's extremely easy to imagine your perfect candidate and get mad that they don't actually exist, and turns out its hard to put up an actually viable candidate that matches any of your fantasies.Personally, and this is just me... but I'd rather chew tinfoil and smash my balls flat with a wooden mallet than see this rematch.I don't either but it's what we got.One has to be 35 years old to run for president, how is there not an age cap on the position?I so was hoping for better choices. I wish these two would just go away.They're really going to make me vote for Joe Biden. Joe Biden.I would love to see them actually box each other. They\u2019re so oldAnd both are trying to get out of debating in primaries. We deserve to vote for better options than these two. (Trump because he\u2019s crazy and old, Biden because he\u2019s neoliberal and old).Grumpier Old Men 2: Electric BoogalooSo sick of these \u2018voting for the lesser evil\u2019 elections. We need real, viable, progressive candidates who will enact actual change and can get people excited about voting again. I despise Biden, but hate Trump more. So I still have to vote for someone I consider to be trash just so things don\u2019t get worse. It fucking sucks.In some ways it may be the rematch Americans deserve.\n\nUnless some Democratic governor decides to run. From my own perspective, Whitmer far better than Newsom.Not the pairing I was hoping for. Sigh. But that's the reality of a two party system.I\u2019m tired of this, grandpa.[How is the best case scenario Joe Biden?](https://youtu.be/KGmXGkIr7w0)They both need to retireNo one wants to see it, let\u2019s be honest.\n\nCan we all just agree to run two different people and we cut them both? Please?Democrats would rather force this insane hostage situation on voters, AGAIN\u2026rather than cede a millimeter of power\n\nAbusive relationship with progressives that keeps enabling democrats at the ballot boxIf it does come down to these two in the general hopefully Trump is spending more time in courts then campaigning.Trump will never hold public office again. 4 time looser.You're overlooking a scarier outcome: Biden vs DeFascist[deleted]It\u2019s like deja vu all over againAfter all the shit Trump is in and the January 6 involvement. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run for anything in politics.I think all Americans would like a younger group to run for office, but they get knocked out early every time in primaries because younger people tend not to vote in them for many reasons mostly time related. Can we just make elections a national F***ing holiday already christ it wouldn't kill businesses to give an extra paid day of to the workers. I mean the fact of how quickly people forgot that magically over night companies could give employees an extra two weeks off for covid.It was entertaining and all for trash tv, but for actually running a country? Hell noAnd that's *why* people tolerate Biden. He's not an attention-addicted maniac caught up in a thousand daily scandals. He's got his scandals, sure (Hunter, the classified docs found in his home, etc.), but it's orders of magnitude fewer than Trump's.\n\nHeard one commentator say the Biden appeal was like a \"Gerald Ford for our times,\" i.e. a more boring and conventional dude to chill things out after the last guy shit the bed.excuse me, excuse me, I'm an Incredible President, but you would never hear that from the Fake News, they don't wanna talk about how we're Number One in the polls, you see Trump is up by almost 100%, maybe even more than that, and you have Governor Ron coming in a tremendously distant and very sad Second Place, and once you get there you have some real problems, they say nobody comes back from Second Place, it's true, and remember Obama hurt us very badly, and it's horrible, we used to be, they say, Totally Protected under Trump, and that sounds pretty great if you ask me.Picking lint out of his bellybutton would\u2019ve been exponentially better than Biden\u2019s take on union strikes, and climate promisesBut who will pay for the wall?Sure, Biden will likely win. But the stress of trumps violent mob and his bullshit lies getting everyone wound up is not gonna be fun.Biden won by razor thin margins in 3 battleground states in the electoral college...Biden barely won when the acting president was doing everything in his power to help a deadly virus infect and kill his constituents.  Now all anyone cares about is the economy and Trump has Biden beat there.Biden isnt evil lol.Well if it comes to it, I just want to say good luck, we're all counting on you.Not even primary season yet we don\u2019t HAVE to have this lolThe irony of thinking there is no choice before the primaries even start. Both of these need a damn competitive primary\u2026There are a number of other candidates declaredAn age cap would entail amending the constitution, which is [not easy](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution).Right? The sad part is I\u2019m actually happy Biden is running because if Kamala Harris was the option- She\u2019d lose handily.\n\nAlso Biden could have had 2 terms and we would have never had Trump (or completely lost SCOTUS) had Biden just fucking ran in 2016 like he was supposed to. (Yes I know about his son.)Whst age?  Age alone is not a disqualifying issue.   You could  have a whole list of things and it would never be enough.  We rely on reasonable voters to keep inept people  out of office, but reasonable voters are few and far between.Well the simple answer is because it isn\u2019t in the constitution.\n  \nGenerally speaking, most laws are created after something bad happens. For a relevant example, the 25th amendment happened only because JFK was assassinated.\n  \nTo-date old age alone has not proven to be an issue in regards to the serving as president. Until that happens, there won\u2019t be an age limit.Can't be long now.Just be happy this will be the last time. 2028 will be an all new starting lineup.There\u2019s no reason for Biden to debate in the primaries. Bernie and everyone else has already agreed that he\u2019s going to be the candidate (barring something happening that would fundamentally change things)DeSantis is scarier because he wears his fascism on his sleeve. But he has 0 personality so he would never win. Plus his crusade against Disney may play well with his idiot base in Florida, I doubt that plays well at all on the national stage.This might be the dumbest shit I've ever seen on this sub...at least spell words right...Jesus christSeems like an odd sentiment. Most people seem to agree that trump's presidency has pretty drastic effects on us policy, political dialogue, and political norms. I don't think we've had a POTUS in the last 30 years who has had such a drastic effect on the fabric of American society and politics.Here's a thing though. There's classified and then there's *classified* and honestly it depends on the department and who's in charge of the department. \n\nAn African diplomat (because of the conflict in the Sudan) may be coming to dinner. His security detail might not want it widely known he's allergic to shellfish. So, it gets classified as \"need to know.\" \n\nThat kinda shit ain't gonna matter in 2 or 3 years unless the dude gains power. But the classified label sticks. \n\nOne of Hilary's \"classified\" emails was two words \"Happy Birthday\" from a Dutch ambassador. \n\nTLDR : Not everything marked \"classified\" is life or death, nuclear weapons grade info.That Gerald Ford comparison is rough since he's (Ford) probably the shining example of the failed structure of the executive branch by a corrupt head of state.\n\nLike genuinely Ford probably did more damage to the legitimacy and accountability of American politicians than any other president and I think you can draw a direct line between his Nixon pardon and the state of affairs today.\n\nI'm not Biden fan (he's still subtantially the lesser of two evils) but I'd be furious if I was compared to Ford of all people.As long as he's not pardoning those deserving of punishment.Yeah there is some good that has been accomplished and if the party decides Biden is running unopposed I'll have to vote for him.  But I'm not happy with it and his inaction on climate and his forcing the unions back to work leaves me a very sour taste in my mouth.Ba dum tissArby\u2019s.Trump's NAFTA 2.0-but-not-really paid for the wall...in profits from...imports from...uh...truck frames and car parts and stuff made in Mexico...then the US gets money from Mexico by...paying for those imports and...look, the math checks out, OK? Trump went to Wharton.Not Il Douche. He skips out on bills.I can already feel it starting. A shit show is coming.Read what I said\u2026again.  I never said Biden was evil.  He\u2019s just not my first choice or my second choice or my third choice\u2026. But he is my choice over Chump.Unless someone captures lightning in a bottle, we basically do. Incumbents with a significant primary challenge do worse in general elections. This isn\u2019t the time for that, barring some generational talent rising to the moment.It's called \"manufacturing consent\".As the chances of US lawmakers ever agreeing on the most minute amendments are 0, the constitution is effectively frozen in place. It\u2019s designed to be a living document. That\u2019s a harbinger of what will become two or more constitutions.In reality it has. Reagan had age related issues in plain sight. Right wing media has kept that from being talked about more.If Biden goes away we're stuck with Harris...I'd laugh at your optimism, but it's not really funny.Everyone else? Meaning the entire country? I\u2019m sorry I missed that discussion. I thought that was called a primary. \n\nEven if you think there is no chance Biden will not be the nomination (I assure you, that\u2019s not accurate), primaries and primary debates still play an important roll in our system. \n\nDo you think Biden would have reduced student loan debt if Bernie wasn\u2019t a threat? Do you think Medicare for all would be as popular today if Bernie and other progressives weren\u2019t on the debate stage calling for it? \n\nPrimaries are for selecting candidates, but they are also for developing the party platform. \n\nIf you can\u2019t see that the actual reason he\u2019s not debating is he and the DNC know the progressive challengers will either win, or force him even more left, you are kidding yourself. \n\nBiden is old. He worlds better than Trump, but he\u2019s hardly the best we should be able to do as a country. The American people deserve to see other options/directions to take the county. \n\nBiden\u2019s strategy is to let Trump dig his own grave. It might work. That doesn\u2019t mean we should all just accept he\u2019s our nominee. How can you believe in democracy and be okay with that? If Biden wins the primary, I\u2019ll vote for him. Even a neoliberal is better than a corrupt moron (Trump) but you can\u2019t tell me with a straight face that Biden is the best option we have.[deleted]Yeah apparently we generate a shit ton of unnecessarily classified material, thanks in part to the ease of digital documentation.You are not wrong about the damage from the Nixon pardon, but consider this: how boring and staid was he otherwise?So you\u2019ll reward a union strike buster and climate liar with a voteInaction on climate?  Didn\u2019t we have largest spend towards climate concerns as part of infrastructure bill?  I got Solar because the federal tax credit was extended and increased under Biden.  I wish there was someone younger and more progressive to vote for too, but it\u2019s not climate inaction that I have in mind.Mexican Arby'sMy guess is the loud minority will get even louder and more violent then before. But Biden will\nUltimate win with more votes then last time.Then make sure loyal military is guarding DC.I think he was my 5th choice.Lesser of two evils is still clearly evil broNothing inspires progressive voters like an ancient moderate holding them hostageWell the point would be for whoever goes against Biden to win right?Calm down Noam.The fact that those \u201cage related issues\u201d are even able to be kept from being talked about, as opposed to the literal assassination of a president, kind of point to the two situations not being remotely comparable.I, I don't recall..Yeah, I don't see a problem with that either.She's one of the most impressive orators of our time....pfft.Well she's better than most.Yeah, Trump will keep running and running and running till he's dead.Good oenYup. And Biden's spin as VP was when the documents found at his home were dated from. Somebody actually said somewhere the boxes were covered in dust, nobody had touched them for years, unlike the revolving door a certain somebody had going on around actual weapons grade classified stuff.Anything  from an ambassador is classified.  Also an email asking about about an article with public released info about a weapons system is classified since the system is classified even tho all info is in it is public release.  One of hillaries emails was classified for this reason.  She linked a scientific publication about one of the weapons system asking someone to make sure the article was proper.Perhaps yes, but the point stands that the single most impactful thing Ford did was brazenly corrupt.Better than rewarding christofacist by putting them in power to further weaken our freedoms.  At least Biden is only ignoring the issue on climate rather than pointing the aircrafts nose down and hitting the after burner like Republicans are trying to do.  And had Republicans hadn't voted against the unions Biden wouldn't have been forced to send them back to work.  But yeah go ahead and avoid blaming the real cause of the problems.I'll admit ground has been made with climate.  I think I'm just bitter about caving to Manchin and Sinema early on and has tainted my opinions since then.Reading is fundamental\u2026 I intentionally said trump is the \u201cevil of two lessors.\u201d  I did not say the \u201clessor of two evils.\u201d  Sad that I have to explain this.Nothing will be inspiring progressives when they are marched to the gulag under another Trump presidency. \n\nThe fascist party needs to be resoundingly defeated at all levels just to bring us *back* to where we were before that Orange Shitstain occupied the White House.Dude you're the one who said old age hadn't \"proven to be an issue\".\n\nReagans senility was an issue. I didn't know it had to be on par with assassination lmaoMost what?Including the fake heiress chick.  You know the conwoman who kept telling people she was an heiress while leeching off them.  Yeah they is video of her walking around the room in mat a Lago the docs were stored in.Biden\u2019s hand picked PEB twice recommended to break the railroad union strike before republicans ever got involved \n\nThat is completely falseSure.  They suck. And this administration has been way more effective in the face of their adversity than one might have imagined.  Anywho, eff trump and get out and vote.They iterally mean the exact same thing.\n\nPlease explain the difference? This should be funUh huh.\n\nI agree Republicans will 100% push us deeper into fascism with every win.\n\nI don't think putting up uninspiring candidates and shaming people for wanting better is the way to beat them.Oh shoot my bad. Did only the last part of my comment load for you. There was a whole bunch of context before that which explained the argument I was making.Cabbages, I'm guessing.Words have meaning\u2026 read it slower.Derp!\n\nThey are two lessor choices.  Trump just happens to be the evil of the two.Well, even thats questionable,what kind of cabbage?",

Republicans threaten Defaults, Shutdowns, etc to bring attention to every demand they have. \n\nRepublicans perform stunt investigations. Hillary Clinton was under congressional investigation for several straight years. Hunter Biden is being proved now. Nothing criminal found. Meanwhile the Mueller report led to the successful prosecution of numerous people including Trump's campaign finance manager, campaign manager, personal lawyer, and National Security Advisor. \n\nDemocrats need to be willing to wrap Thomas ethics investigation into the Debt Ceiling debate. Not because it will lead to significant changes in written law. Because it will get the media discussing it. It will bring the matter to national awareness. It will show people what's going on.\n\nThere is a performative side to politics. An attention getting component. Democrats should want this issue to get attention. This is a winning issue. Reasonable people. Average voters will see the absurdity of Thomas. Democrats just need to bring this issue into the light.That picture... that picture... that picture. You know someone at VOX is happy about that. Given the circumstances it really fits.Damning with faint praise: *Clarence Thomas,* ***not uniquely*** *corrupt.*One must have to be so arrogantly drunk on power to think they could get away with something like this forever.America, your ship is listing heavily to the right. Appears your vessel is taking on water. Do you copy?Shithole country is rightNo shit SherlockTime to bring in the FBIShocked, I tell you! SHOCKED.The US is a broken system, kept alive by monied interests who throw culture wars and propaganda at us to keep us from rallying against them to make a better world.\n\nI think, frankly, that we need to start over. New constitution, new protections in place rather than gentleman's agreements between the branches, removal of lobbyists in politics, etcAccurate thumbnail is accurate.Part the article seems to imply that the Court cannot vote to force its own members to recuse themselves because Roberts is worried they would vote each other out of cases for partisan or ideological reasons. \n\nSo even in his defense he admits that his Court is too corrupt to be trusted.I truly hope that these justices clerks read Reddit, and that congressional staffers or executive aides do the same. I think these boomers in office are lacking an awareness of just how close america is to the pitchforks and torches method of impeachment. If they don\u2019t self regulate we will eventually have to act like we were French.Did you ever notice that even when there is no question that laws have been broken, cops never go arrest \"important\" people?Headline is pretty no shit??!![deleted]Folks. For the sake of truth, consider other news outlets. Vox is extremely biased and I vote Dems top to bottom. Don\u2019t get brained washed by this stuff.nothing suspicious about \"conservative\" Judges being targeted for ouster, with a Dem President and Dem Senate and elections coming up.\n\nHmmmm, has nothing to do abortion, or being \"conservative\"This dude always has the meanest expressions.  Like he\u2019s actually snarling.  Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him smile or laugh.  This pic must be a fake!  Jk.  Sort ofOkay, but can we start with him then and work our way from there? Because the country is burning, we need serious change.Roberts and the rest of the hoodlum gang flat out don't give a rats ass. They'll change the rules to suit whatever their agenda is, mainly maintaining power.Corruption or flagrant forgetfulness or downright misinterpreting of the law?\n\nFelons after release from jail, are expected to join the police force to expunge their records and restore their rights!  Or can discuss similar antics with the governor.  But is possible to get their rights to vote restored.What? Really? No way! /sI never liked Long Dong SilverYou have Congress members becoming millionaires & they want to criticize a man that rode his friend\u2019s private jet?No doy.Fire them all.  We don\u2019t need a fucking Supreme CourtWhat a picture to use for that thumbnailThis is the angle of Clarence Thomas I never wanted.   Does this man ever clean his nose?The Robert\u2019s Court legacy will be one of corruption and enabling Fascist policy.Biden needs to load the court up with 10 justices- these 9 do not represent all of AmericaI would honestly settle for some formal investigation at this point.> are extremely slim.\n\nYou spelled \"non existent\" incorrectlyWithout an ironclad code of conduct, the Justices with a lifetime tenure are ripe for corruption.Especially when lazy American voters won\u2019t vote in midterms.If I\u2019m reading this right it states that if a SC justice doesn\u2019t recuse then the decision made could be then appealed.  It then seems a no-brainer to appeal every decision that Thomas is in on.The court needs to be expanded\u2026the democrats clearly have no intention of doing so.He'd find a witch hunter from the 1600's who says it's alright to get paid under the table, because no one sees itHow much does anyone want to bet on them insider trading on stock related to their decisions? Like manufacturers of abortion medsAll the founding fathers made bank. Personal patronage was widespread and actually how the political system worked back then.Sold it for $2million. $250k-500k was his investment income/capital gain on the property that he was a part owner on for ~10 years. It was for sale for 2 years but just happened to sell to the head of a law firm right when he became a justice.Same as it ever wasAs the Constitution allows. However, the Constitution may require Congress to pay justices, but it doesn't require Congress to pay for heating, A/C, staff, security, . . . for SCOTUS. OTOH, I figure most clerks would do so unpaid to have their clerkships on their resumes.\n\nNo, not going to happen. Checks and balances have degenerated into mutually assured destruction, otherwise each branch is left on its own to police itself.They were considering subpoena for Thomas (to answer questions before the committee) but don't have the votes. You think Thomas snubs that subpoena? He can probably get away with it.I mean it\u2019s their wet dream so yeah.*(said son didn't win ~~the popular vote~~ his first election)The \u201csports\u201d section\u2026\n\n\u201cThe hunters, some of whom hold titles like Grand Master, Prior and Knight Grand Officer, wear dark-green robes inscribed with a large cross and the motto \u201cDeum Diligite Animalia Diligentes,\u201d\n\nGod damn.Dang. I have so many questions nowThat was an excellent read.  One part I liked\n\n\u201cI teach law at New York University. When I talk to my students, most seem to understand constitutionalism, and in particular, judicial review, as working comfortably hand-in-hand with democracy. But in reality, the relationship is more difficult and subtle: Constitutionalism and democracy are more like frenemies. By enforcing constitutional rules, judicial review helps to smooth out democracy\u2019s rough edges. But when they overturn\n 4\n\ndemocratically enacted laws, judges shrink our capacity to make decisions for ourselves. And if judges overdo it, judicial review can preempt necessary democratic development. At the extreme, instead of making democratic life more decent and predictable, interventionist courts can spark long-lasting and intense conflict.\u201dOr, and hear me out, we just pay them more to vote differently.Thanks for sharing that.So you see the following happening: Biden/Yellen pays debts anyway -> Congressional Republicans sue Biden/the government -> matter before the supreme court. I suppose it could happen that way.But they will.And for such little sums.Negative. We do not copy. We're too busy drowning ourselves with drugs - both legal and illegal, alcohol and mindless television programming, and poisoning our population with toxic foods to notice that we're taking on water. \n\nAmerica's golden age is behind them. Western Europe - specifically Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands are the best hope for mankind over the next 60-130 years.We don\u2019t need a new constitution. We need to begin to amend the one we have again.Yup. The conservative establishment refuses to give an inch. It's their way or the highway. They've entrenched their power and I guess the only solution is to wait them out since we're mostly talking about people on borrowed time.Why would you do that? Your bothsiderism is lazy and pointless. Show some evidence, anything, that suggests Dems and Reps are equivalent here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey really aren't, but you comment sure works to support and defend the Reps.Bias doesn\u2019t change facts though.  Thomas has taken a ton of undisclosed gifts from a billionaire with business before the court.  Gorsuch had a real estate deal materialize out of thin air after being appointed to the court that he didn\u2019t report.  Bare minimum 2/6 conservative justices are corrupt and that\u2019s leaving out how at least one of the seats are stolen (ACB, Gorsuch, or both).  Bias is about intent and message, and vox does decent reporting on a factual basisThat is correct.  It has to do with Clarence\u2019s rulings on the SC of the billionaire who funds his lavish vacations,  launders his money,  and all his other crimes.   Judges are supposed to be impartial.He'll be known for leading the most corrupt court in our history and undermining our democracy by letting billionaires take over with Citizens United.You hope. In reality it will be of fearless moral leaders who brought about righteousness and upheld the highest laws of god.13. One for each federal district.But a decision to investigate Republican judges would make Garland's Federalist buddies sad.The explanations put forth by Roberts seem unsatisfactory to me. The idea that anyone, including the Supremes, is above the law, is unacceptable.Interesting idea. But who could they appeal to?This would need sixty votes. They don\u2019t have them.Not to defend Gorsuch or minimize the importance of the timing of the purchase at all, because I think there is a very clear potential for conflicting interest, but $2M for a large house on a big tract of land in Boulder is extremely believable.Same as it ever wasThey should also arrest his traitor wife.How's my edit for yaHonestly, if this references The Order of St Hubertus, their *professed* position isnt too bad.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\\_Order\\_of\\_St.\\_Hubertus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Order_of_St._Hubertus)\n\n>According to the organization's American website, the purpose of the Order is to \"promote sportsmanlike conduct in hunting and fishing, foster good fellowship among sportsmen from all over the world\", \"teach and preserve sound traditional hunting and fishing customs\", \"encourage wildlife conservation and to help protect endangered species from extinction\", \"promote the concept of hunting and fishing as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity\", \"endeavor to ensure that the economic benefits derived from sports hunting and fishing support the regions where these activities are carried out\", and \"strive to enhance respect for responsible hunters and fishermen\".Lol. Soros-funding may help. But even he doesn\u2019t have as much as right-wing donors.There is an aggressive wing of the Republican caucus that wants to default and  won't actually negotiate no way what. The ones who aren't willing to go off the cliff are already prepared to pass a vote. \n\nThe entire negotiation is performative. Nothing Biden can do will move Republicans.Until poor people can participate as representatives there will be no waiting them out, friend. We need far more decisive action if we want out from under the yoke. It\u2019s insane to think that the Supreme Court has no accountability or mandatory operating rules. The idea that some billionaire doesn\u2019t have business before the court is laughable- how on earth would we know what their investment portfolio looks like? You don\u2019t have to own a business to have a stake in outcomes. They know this. They know that we know this. That fact alone says enough.Bias can greatly distort the truth. I\u2019m not disputing your claims nor the claims of the article. I\u2019m just pointing out that Vox, Vice, Fox, CNN, NewsMax are all in the business of selling you outrage. I\u2019m encouraging readers to pick better news outlets.Yep Judges are supposed to be impartial. The fact that pundits can accurately predict along party lines the out come, shows how partial the Judges areMost corrupt court so far.*citizens unitedThis is a really interesting thought. I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s a non-zero amount of thinking toward \u201cif victors write the history books, continuing to help these guys is my only remaining chance at a positive legacy.\u201dLaws don't apply to the people who make the law. Let that one sink in.Will this somehow make all of the cases they\u2019ve handled susceptible  to review or something else? Let\u2019s say if a future senate were to get a 2/3 vote at some point?Cannot upvote this enough. This makes a ton of sense.Markey is introducing a change to add 4It being on the market 2 years and the timing of the sale is a bit less believable.Letting the days go bySame as it ever was\u2026No, I\u2019m sure they were/are just honest sportsmen. In weird religious cult cloaks.Right, this power grab by the Supreme Court will likely get much worse before anyone has the political will to try and reform the court - despite how fast public opinion on the court has ebbed - and by then it could be too late. Something should have been done when they appointed a president in 2000, they have become bolder in thumbing their nose at the law since the coupYeah, my comment is optimistic in that eventually things get better and future historians look back, but you're right it could go the other way and they be remembered as the legal guardians that brought in a new \"Golden Age\" if the timeline gets worse.I pray that the evil exposes themselves and civilization snaps out of it.I\u2019d like to see 26. Two per federal district. Then each case that goes before the SC gets a randomly selected panel of 9.\n\nThat way, it\u2019s never the same group of Justices presiding over a case, and therefore it\u2019s harder to know which Justices to bribe.\n\nEdit: okay, here\u2019s my ideal set up.\n\n* 52 Justices: 4 selected from each federal district.\n* 26 year terms - 2 justices appointed each year. This makes it long enough to meet the intention of the founders but also provides some certainty.\n* vacancies midterm are filled from the district represented by the departed justice, nominated by the chief justice vetted and approved by the a 2/3 vote of the 50 remaining justices to serve the remainder of the term.\n* 2/3 of the whole bench required to approve taking up a case.\n* if taken up by the court, then 13 justices are randomly assigned to hear the case. \n* litigants can appeal to have their case heard by the whole bench if they disagree with the ruling of the 13 justices, but 2/3 of the justices that did not hear the case have to agree to take it up after reading the ruling and dissenting opinions of the court.\n\nAnd it goes without saying: codes of conduct, etc etc.I'm not convinced. There's 27 million acres in Colorado at $1/acre that's been on the market going on six years\\*\"Gilded Age\"Good idea.Sorry, this is a bad idea.  The highest court needs to actually be final in a sense that lasts more than 1 year.  The more consistent the law remains, the stronger it is, both in practical terms (i.e., for lawyers and lower court judges) and in political terms (i.e., its perceived legitimacy).  \n\nIf cases are heard by a revolving set of SCOTUS Justices, then one set of facts could get a different result year after year after year.  Congress would be all the more irrelevant - and SCOTUS the new lawmakers.  SCOTUS would be capable of completely contradictory rulings at any time, and that's not good for anyone.What about? Does your # reference real estate?Disagree. Sets of facts will always get revised according to who is on the bench. Where\u2019s Roe?\n\nEstablish a more difficult to corrupt court. The suggestion helps with that. Therefore it\u2019s good.It can still take a 2/3 majority of all justices to determine if the court will take up a case. They don\u2019t need to take up the same issue every year.\n\nIt\u2019s just that the justices assigned to a case that is going to be heard would change up on a case by case basis. \n\nHaving a wide bench like this is common in many European countries and seems to work pretty well.We already do everything you are complaining of at the Circuit court of appeals level.  When cases go before the Circuit Court, they are randomly assigned to 3 circuit court judges.  The case is decided by those 3 judges.  Litigants have the option after getting the opinion of the 3 judges to ask for an *en banc* (or whole court) rehearing of the case.\n\nIf the issue is that big, then the Court can choose to do *en banc* arguments and decisions.  This isn't hard.It was a single lot, yes. Came with a herd of bison. Zillow tells me there's a bunch of less cheap lots in rural colorado (2400ac/3.5m) along with some *mansions* in the 3-10mil range. [Here's one that's been listed over a year](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3412-151-County-Rd-Gypsum-CO-81637/94652403_zpid/)>Sets of facts will always get revised according to who is on the bench\n\nI'm not sure I see your point.  Roe survived for **50 years**, and all radical judges could do was chip at its edges for all that time.  Overturning big precedents is a big deal right now, even with a corrupt SCOTUS.  And without any kind of meaningful established ethical guidelines, how are 13 - or 21 or even 50 - justices harder for billionaires to corrupt than 9?  Thomas is selling out for pocket change to them.  Worse, the Federalist Society has a huge stable of radicals that would still be awful justices even if they weren't corrupt.\n\nBut more than that, *lower* courts would have no idea what to do.  They'll be further emboldened to make their own batshit rulings because \"who knows what SCOTUS will decide on appeal?\"  And, again, with no real consistency the legal community will be in chaos.  Cases will take longer and therefore, be more expensive.  Backlogs will worsen.  Outcomes will worsen.  Clients won't know when to settle or when to go to court.  It would be the wild west - and that's not a good thing.  Respect/legitimacy for the courts would get even worse.I'm aware.  But the difference is that there are many circuit courts that can - and do - have different opinions amongst themselves, whereas there is only one SCOTUS that has the final word when they disagree (for a reasonable period of time, certainly for as long as the same court makeup exists).  If there are, practically-speaking, multiple SCOTUS's, their word can no longer be considered final for any amount of time.I\u2019m certain you\u2019re right about houses and those on sale for a long time in general. But in this specific case, it doesn\u2019t look good when one\u2019s mansion, on sale for such a long time, gets sold to one\u2019s friend as soon as one gets a big powerful position.Currently, the billionaires can focus their corrupting efforts on a few Justices. The more they have to spread that effort around, the more likely they will come to light.\n\nThey also might end up going before a panel that is made up of Justices that they couldn\u2019t buy. \n\nIn other words the expected value (outcome) of bribery will go down.Most of the circuit courts follow their own precedent.  Once a 3 judge panel decides an issue, unless it is reversed *en banc* or by the USSC, the circuit follows the decision.  \n\nThat said, *en banc* requests of the USSC could answer questions with finality if there was ever an issue where one group of justices came to a different conclusion than another group of justices.Not a good look, but within the realm of possibility. I don't think he isn't corrupt, but a house sold at market value after being on the market a normal amount of time isn't a very good smoking gunWith a wide bench, multiple cases can be handled concurrently, to alleviate backlogs.\n\nMy proposal is not that outlandish. It is the way some [other countries](https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-STD(1997)020-e) run their supreme courts.\n\nAnother change I would like to see is for there to be 13 year term limits, that are staggered. Every year, one justice is appointed. That way, every president is empowered to appoint the same number. The senate should have to hold hearings for every nominee. None of the bs that the Republicans have pulled to delay until after an election or rush to get in before an election. Every president gets to appoint 4 out of 26 justices per term.\n\nIf a justice dies mid-term, the remaining justices can nominate and elect someone to fill the remainder of the term.\n\nSubjecting the make up of the court to the uncertainties of lifespan is stupid.> 13 year term limits, that are staggered. Every year, one justice is appointed. That way, every president is empowered to appoint the same number\n\nThis reform would go way farther to addressing SCOTUS's legitimacy issues.  Since '92, Democratic presidents have sat five justices in (nearly) five terms.  In the same period, Republicans have sat five justices in *three* terms.  Political machinations cannot continue to decide when nominations occur, completely at odds with the will of the American people.\n\n> The senate should have to hold hearings for every nominee.\n\nPreaching to the choir.  \"The Senate **shall** advise and consent\" is not optional language.  Republicans are breaking every democratic norm that gets in their way.",

All electronic ballots must be accompanied by a paper ballot  \n\nThey also set security controls, like defined roles and responsibilities and are required to meet  and they must meet NIST-800-53 security requirements in their data centers. \u2026This is the same as DOD.  \n\nMy bet is they end up with a manual paper ballot system rife with security and compliance issues.>My bet is they end up with a manual paper ballot system rife with security and compliance issues.\n\nThey want a paper ballot system because it's easier to cheat.Election systems are also Open Source, meaning everyone knows the code..no back doors. The OS is secured which a checksum, and no changes can be made. Configuration data is stored separate, and also locked down with a checksum. Data is stored in yet another isolated, encrypted partition. Extensive logging ensures all compute and admin activities are logged and monitored, and no role has enough access to make changes without their cohort on another party present and logged in, and no process or procedures can be completed without massive oversight\u2026No one has complete access.The real reason they besmirched Dominion and Smartmatic with conspiracies\u2026So\u2026. All of this has seemed a bit ridiculous to you?They have their collective heads in their asses\u2026.\ud83d\ude01I hate it when the politicians start talking about fields that I\u2019m expert in.  They already seem to be clueless.  \n\nWe need more engineers in government",

God only knows what else is out there.And Jack Smith has asked for the recordings.\n\n>BREAKING: DoJ Special Counsel Jack Smith has asked Abby Grossman's lawyer for recordings, including the new Ted Cruz coup admission and the recording of Rudy admitting he didn't have evidence of election fraud. Source: @AriMelber\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MuellerSheWrote/status/1650991037836591107>Cruz reportedly tried to sell his plan to Fox host and Trump ally Maria Bartiromo on Jan. 2\u2014four days before the Capitol riot\u2014pitching a scheme to overthrow the 2020 election by blocking the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s win on Jan. 6, then establishing a commission to investigate the nonexistent claims of fraud which would ultimately \u201cdecide\u201d who to inaugurate.  \n>  \n>Airing the audio, Melber explains that when Bartiromo asks Cruz who would eventually decide who gets inaugurated under his plan, \u201cCruz answers that this fake, made up, so-called commission that he and his Trump buddies were planning to try to create to bureaucratize a coup\u2014and that\u2019s what they were trying to do\u2014that was his answer, that\u2019s how they would steal this race.\u201dThis is why so many Republicans go to bat for Trump. They're just as guilty of everything he did and admitting he's a fascist piece of shit will implicate them as the same reprehensible shit stains.I am vindicated with the evidence that we were all correct in saying that the Republican Party attempted a coup, and simultaneously in despair because I know if I show my Fox News 24/7 watching father this he\u2019ll just ignore it. God I hate these scumbags.Let's not forget this is after Trump called Ted's wife ugly.\n\nYou couldn't find this level of cuckoldry on pornhub.Indict him, give him a trial, lock his ass up.. everyone involved in the insurrection and defrauding the US election.Once again, to the absolute surprise of nobody. Not even his own constituents.This all just reeks of an old guard crumbling, dying out, and in the final throes of clinging to power they used to monopolize so easily. Democracy and education did them in, so\nthey\u2019re nuking democracy and education. It\u2019s all so unseemly, weak, and just kinda\u2026pathetic.I love how on Twitter, Cruz is trying to downplay it by saying he said the exact same thing publicly the same day, but uh, not really helping. \n\nAlso as a side note, another one of the audios had Peter Navarro claiming to gross berg that guys like Brad Parscale were pocketing Trump campaign money instead of using it on \"challenging election results\", which to be fair isn't at all a surprise, but it's nice to have some more confirmation. https://twitter.com/TheBeatWithAri/status/1650996575739445250Rafael Cruz is such a comically spineless character he would be too unrealistically cowardly for a Disney movieI do not like that man Ted Cruz...Their voters don't care. They don't want to govern, they want to rule.Really got overlooked at the time, but this guy\u2019s speeches in Georgia there at the end of the Senate election were absolutely insane and laden with violent rhetoric.I feel like this week we are finding out why Dominion settled for \"only\" $775 millionJesus. The term cuck is thrown around a lot and I don't want to kink shame anyone, but fuckin Christ if someone did me as dirty as trump did him I wouldn't be going out of my way to ensure they got a table at a restaurant let alone another 4 years in the highest office in the country. This has please bang my wife energy50 years ago, this would have been bigger than Watergate.\n\nEven 20 years ago, and there would have been massive prosecutions and immense public outrage on both sides.\n\nIn 2023, this is\u2026 Tuesday.I hope this gets Jack Smith\u2019s attention.Thank you whistleblower Abby Grossberg and all the other whistleblowers out there. Traitor Ted Cruz is un-American, he should be publicly shamed and step aside from his seat. I wonder what else is on the 90 recordings and if we will ever be able to hear them.I'd like to think this would be a big deal, but the American right is a death cult, and this won't even phase them.[removed]Okay now can we throw some people in jail for  fucks sakeHe wanted a \u201ccommission\u201d to conduct a 10 day audit of the election, after which states could convene special sessions of their legislatures to change their votes if needed. \n\nIt took over 4 months to audit one county in Arizona. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that 10 day audit was going to be a sham. This was after 2 months of fraud claims that had no proof and never have had proof.Ted Cruz was one of the people banging on the doors in Florida trying to prevent the recount in 2000. He's no stranger to stealing elections.\n\nAlso, I'd wager that damn near every Republican was scheming to steal it. That's their entire shtick.Remember when Democrats demanded an incredibly qualified senator step down for faking to grab a woman's breasts long before he was a senator?The irony is that this is the type of crooked shit that supposedly drives people to like Trumpism in the first place.\n\nCitizens of Texas: Cruz does not care about you, your state, doing his actual job, or the votes of your fellow citizens. Vote this motherFUCKER out in \u201824.It\u2019s not a bombshell if there isn\u2019t accountability. The republicans don\u2019t give a shit.Fuckin TedColluding treasonFucker straight up planned the entire coup attempt. Texas, run any Democrat that owns a gun for the love of God.>Melber explains that when Bartiromo asks Cruz who would eventually decide who gets inaugurated under his plan, \u201cCruz answers that this fake, made up, so-called commission that he and his Trump buddies were planning to try to create to bureaucratize a coup\u2014and that\u2019s what they were trying to do\u2014that was his answer, that\u2019s how they would steal this race.\u201d\n\nThat puts Cruz in deep, maybe even mastermind of a scheme.It's high time to investigate this scumbag that nobody likes.The funny thing about this (well, not funny haha) is that he's right that this isn't necessarily a \"bombshell,\" because he did say effectively the same thing in public.  I mean, did anyone in this country ***not*** know that the Republicans were trying to steal the election?  Was anyone actually confused about why they were voting not to certify?  They were absolutely brazen about it.\n\nAnd of course they were.  By doing it in public and declaring that they had the right to do it, they were using a classic fascist technique.  No one can \"catch you\" committing a crime if you walk into the public square and say \"I am doing this, and it's not a crime.\"  If someone stands up and says \"of course that's a crime,\" then you just shout them down as ridiculous, because why would anyone be committing a crime in the public square?  Of course it's not a crime.  And if it is a crime, it shouldn't be.  Etc.\n\nSo, yeah, this isn't a bombshell.  We knew this already.  ***But***, that isn't a reason to ignore it.  On the contrary, this is a reminder that there must be consequences for violating the Constitution and the law -- for trying to eliminate democracy.  If there aren't, then it was all just a dress rehearsal.I hate Cruz as much as anyone else but reading the article, I\u2019m not seeing what the bombshell is here. There appears to be audio of something Cruz said to a Fox News host a day before he said the same thing to her on air. Then he even said the same thing in Congress. If anything it seems like he wanted to find actual testimonies of voter fraud and then try to find a solution within the framework of the constitution to overturn results. Barring the fact that he probably knew Trump lost, which almost every GOP member probably believes too, what am I missing?Lock him up.\n\nTreasons Ted, seditious conspirator.We're talking about Ted Cruz the Zodiac Killer right?A U.S. Senator on tape plotting to overthrow the results of a presidential election. This is fucking wild.Can't wait for nothing to happen :/So Cruz & cohorts are traitors.Princeton University and Harvard University must be so proud.\n\nWonder if Ted is booking a flight to Cancun...Traitor TedWhy isn\u2019t this traitor in jail????Senator, any comments on leaked audio you conspired to commit treason in collusion with a media empire that just recently settled a civil case regarding voting lies where-in they themselves admitted the courts would find certain facts of the case \"damaging to their case\"?It doesn't matter. There could be a video of him pissing on the constitution while stuffing ballots into a cartoon sack and the lunatics of this country would do mental somersaults and justify it. They might just call it fake.In the videos from Jan 6, wasn't there a guy going through papers at the podium on the House floor saying things like:\n\n\"don't take that, Ted Cruz wouldn't like that.\"\n\n?What exactly is new here? Cruz himself says he said the same thing the next day. There was some press conference where he says to form a commission to investigageIt\u2019s a bombshell for people who actually care and have standards for politicians.  This is great for his base.What will come of it?I won't be surprised if Jack Smith serves Abby Grossberg with a subpoena for all J6 audio.Just speculation, but I'm thinking there may be audio involving Tucker that hasn't been released, yetLol screw the Twitter Files, release the Fox Tapes!throw him out of office. arrest him. no tolerance for these traitors and threats to our democracyIndict him nowThey did it in plain sight and have had 0 consequences.Remember when Al Franken resigned for pretending to grab someone's boobs?I checked /r/conservatives  and /r/conservative and not a single post about Ted Cruz. I wonder why.Am I missing something? This feels like a nothingburger. Like, in that recording he didn't say anything that he hasn't said publicly. Yes, he was trying to overthrow and steal the election, yes, he's a traitor, but he's said just as much on national television.And nobodies going to hold him accountable. Rinse and repeat with these fuckheads. They did something illegal, they keep their position and don\u2019t get arrested.I do not like that man Ted Cruz.Good investigate every single politician I don't care what party they're with get them out of public office! We deserve so much better!!Republicans will come out in droves to further support this thing.\n\nCorruption is a feature for them, not a bug.Surely there will be consequences this time, right?\u2026. RIGHT?Straight up watching succession and there\u2019s a scene where the GOP are all meeting up w the rich fucks in America to talk shop. Sounds familiarThe day after Jan 6 Cruz called it a terrorist attack. So he knowingly cast his lot in with people he called terrorists\n\nThis is very very dangerous. I hope voters can understand why they roundly need to reject terrorists as the leader of AmericaEvery single one of these shit mongers need to be rotting in Gitmo. The same damn hell they were happy to torture brown people in.I bet he's on his way to Cancun again now.The center/left: \u201coh wow, *shocking*\u201d\n\nThe right: \u201cgood for you Ted!\u201dToo bad nothing is going to happen to him because the american government is completely cucked and doesn't care about corruptionAnd yet again nothing will happenBut please conservatives, tell us how both parties are the same...There is nothing likable about this man. I remember when there was an emergency power grid failure in Texas and he was busted taking off for the tropics while people in his state froze to death. Best part? On camera, pulling his little wheelie suitcase through the airport, he tried to blame his daughter for leaving. It is bizarre to me that that one human being can be so abhorrent like a slug, or excrement. He is just horrible.And yet nothing will happen and nothing will changeAnything going to happen or is it the same old political theater/Potomac two step?So it's treason, isn't it?Him and every other republican who supported the insurrection needs to be removed from office. Now. They are traitors.Tapes, documents and even witnesses don\u2019t seem to be enough to directly and swiftly administer equal approaches to justice. The system is beyond brokenHis wife is ugly as shit too.There was a time when I would have been hopeful that something like this would result in charges or removal from elected office or barring from any future elected office. But that hope has long such been stripped away.We have to stop calling this bombshell news. It's not a bombshell. It's another republican trying demolish democracy. It's barely even news, it's just a given.Is it a bombshell when half the country already figured it was happening and the other half doesn't care?Another bombshell going no where. They wonIf this isn\u2019t treason then what is?So the same \"Stop the steal\" people are the ones doing the stealing. I see all the patterns.Unfortunately a \"bombshell\" like this in the US is now just as regular as a school shooting, and the right base is perfectly desensitized.And not a peep on r/ConservativeRepublicans - \"Blah blah blah, States Rights, Republicanism, blah blah blah. Hey wait that's not turning out how we want. Let's intervene. Fuck States rights\".I'm guessing this news will hurt Ted Cruz with his base in Texas and that we will finally be rid of him!\n\n/sarcIt doesn't matter. The right doesn't care, they want to cheat as long as they win democracy is not important to them.So you're telling me a horrible shitty person did something horribly shitty? No way!What a colossal piece of shit \n\nTexas\u2026 this is who you want representing you? You deserve betterAnyone plotting to steal an election should be yanked from their position of governmental leadership.This evidence is damning for so many people.\n\nAnd nothing will come of it.In any other time period of America he would've been hanged for treason in Texas, even by his own devoted supporters.Yeah. Insurrection in DC, fake electors, Trump calling officials telling them to find 11,000 votes, Cruz talking about a fake panel to reject the election results and appoint Trump President.\n\n\nAm I missing anything?\n\nWill these right wing nuts all be brought to justice?It\u2019s always the ones you most suspect.Ok, but is anything going to come from it? Gaetz is still in power and he's involved with sex trafficking.>\u201cIt\u2019s got to be demonstrable facts that can be laid out with evidence because that\u2019s what a court of law is going to look to\u2014not just an allegation but actual fact.\u201d\n\n64 times Trump and Rudy's \"demonstrable facts\" and \"evidence\" were laughed out of actual Courts of Law.\n\nI'm glad this little \"loophole\" the traitors thought they had has already been closed.\n\nDirty fucking republican cheaters.Isn\u2019t this treason? Good lordThe best part is that absolutely nothing is going to happen to him because we live in hell \ud83d\ude43Not for nothing but this isn\u2019t anything new. I was up all night watching the certification of the election that night. I thought it was stupid and weakly out together but Cruz same nearly the same thing verbatim then.\n\nHe\u2019s a sleazy piece of shit and all that other jazz but this isn\u2019t really new. There would have been a kernel of logic to his argument if you know it hadn\u2019t all been proven leading up to Jan 6th.okay I love you guys and hate Ted Cruz but how is what he said in private different than what he said in public.What is the bombshell here? He doesn\u2019t say anything he didn\u2019t already say publicly.And nobody will do anything about it. Because Republicans have so much control of the courts and \u201cJustice\u201d systems.Toss it on the dusty pile of things people like him will never be held accountable for.No one read the article did they?The 'bombshell' where he says the exact same thing he put in a public press release?\n\nhttps://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/joint-statement-from-senators-cruz-johnson-lankford-daines-kennedy-blackburn-braun-senators-elect-lummis-marshall-hagerty-tuberville\n\nCruz is a POS. But this is reaching. Like it or not, both Houses have the right to come together to dispute electoral votes. It's been done by both parties. That's not illegal or a coup.Wow, this gives me a lot more respect for ole' Ted, because I didn't think he was clever enough to be involved with something as sleazy as this! Before I just thought he was pond scum, but now he's sleazy pond scum!LOL these fools were doing this in public. Should be more tapes.I bed there will be zero condemnation from the GQP.In summary, Ted Cruz will do and say anything, including selling his mother and wife, if it will get him closer to staying another term in office. He will obfuscate it by growing a longer, weirder beard.Might as well throw it on the pile of evidence that the DOJ will simply ignore.\u201cBombshell\u201d\n\nNothing will happen.Surely r/conservatives will post about this and expose the republican party right!?It won\u2019t be as bad as we hope and nothing real will come of this.It's always the ones you medium expect.Why are Canadians always doing this?*insert pretends to be shocked meme*Once upon a time this would have caused someone to resign.No surprise here, it is the only way Republicans can win an election. Millennials and GenZ are not voting for them.The law is pretty clear on what we should do with treasonous traitors.Wtf happened to Maria?\nJoey Ramone must be rolling in his grave.\n\nIts so sad shes this...- fuck I thought she was a smart great person (before Fox ). Super disappointing. \n\nHeres a link to her part from LA times\n\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-09/fox-news-anchor-maria-bartiromo-dominion-defamation-suit-murdoch-trump-election-2020-carlsonAnd just 15 years ago he\u2019d be burned at the stake and banned from politics for the rest of his days. Now it\u2019ll be forgotten before lunch tomorrowGotta love how they always have to find some way to dick with a system that is working when it does not work for them!\n\nGerrymandering don\u2019t work then it\u2019s voter fraud and then it\u2019s we have to find a mechanism when that falls throughWhat a sniveling shit weasel.Ted Cruz molests babies at a local hospital nursery for children dying from cancer. Or he doesn\u2019t. I think it should be up to the American people to make up their mind about whether or not Ted Cruz molests dying babies. I am just purely expressing my right to speculate.And like everything else in US politics.. accountability/consequences will not take place.No question Ted Cruz and the related people around these schemes would have been hung for treason by the founding fathers.  Just saying\u2026.Jail for politicians needs to be a thingI thought we all already knew this? Ted Cruz is a terrible person, I have not idea why my fellow Texas keep falling for this joke of a man.The shocker many saw coming - Republicans are the deep state actorsChange \u201cbombshell\u201d to \u201cpredictable\u201dOnce upon a time, plotting to overthrow the government was an executable offenseI\u2019m from the future, nothing came of this and Ted Cruz is now permanently governing from Cancun since Texas is flood plains.Surprise, Surprise,  Surprise! \ud83d\ude12Time and time again, Republicans keep reminding us they are the party of liars an hypocrites.Ted Cruz is a piece of shit this is not a bombshellI get frustrated with the term \u201ccertified\u201d when referring to Congress\u2019 role in the electoral process. They are only charged with counting the electoral votes as certified by the States. They can object to the counts but the law is clear how to handle that and what can be done. \n\nThis YouTube video does a great job of dispelling the myths and conjecture at the time of what the Republicans could do to derail the counting of the votes and announcing the winner. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/I6sVow9l8H4\n\nCongress doesn't certify the election...they count the electoral votes. States certify their results, and Congress only has the  constitutional role of counting votes...\"certification\" implies some sort of oversight or investigative authority or responsibility to Congress, which they don't have.\n\nWhenever people use the term 'certify' for Congress's role, it lends legitimacy to the propaganda that Trump and his cronies want to use to expand the powers that they have in Congress for their own ends. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15Dude was willing to sell out his country for a Pat on the back from the man that called his wife a dog. And somehow these are the real patriots\u2026And nothing will be done because the ruling parties don\u2019t give a shit\u2026doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in charge as long as the circus still runs and you all pay for admission\u2026.it\u2019s like this in every democratic countryRepublicans are fucking awfulIs it against reddit policy to vocally support the death penalty in the case of treasonous riffraf(ael) caught going coup-coup?\n\nI'm not saying this applies to Ted ~~Coups~~ Cruz, but I'm not saying it doesn't.\n\nAsking for several million friends.The sad thing is Republicans will justify him no matter what. Its like a cult.In a surprise to no one, the party that demands election integrity spends a lot of time plotting ways to rig elections in their favor.\n\nOnce again, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt: the GOP accuses Dems of what they\u2019re doing.The crazy thing is that he\u2019s (kinda) right. He did say this shit on tv and on the floor.  *And he got away with it.*. Nobody called him on it, but this isn\u2019t new.  He should already be in a huge amount of trouble.Whaaat?! Not Ted Cruz! /sI do not like that man Ted CruzThere will be no consequences, as per usualMy uncle will vote for Ted *because* Ted tried to cheat. Anything to oWn tHuH LibSHas anyone else just kind of given up and realized democracy is totally fucked and just going with it? No consequences for any of the political actors involved in Jan 6th. None. America, you in danger, girl.How is this even remotely a \"bombshell\"? Like, if he had flat-out admitted that they were going to try to steal the election *in those words* or something, that would be big, but none of what's shown in this article is anything different than what he had said publicly.He is, after all, a weasel. What else other than weasel behavior is to be expected.There's another extreme right-wing piece of crap NaziUnfortunately, since Rafael Cruz is missing his spine, this will have zero effect on him and Texas voters will overwhelmingly vote him back into office next year.Guys, guys listen, hear me out... I'm starting to think this Cruz guy isn't the upstanding citizen we all think him to beYou really have to question the people who willingly vote for this turd.At this point I don't think we can call the revelation that a Republican official is a traitor a \"bombshell.\"\n\nI would honestly be more surprised if just a single one of them was caught on tape saying that things have gone too far, on their side.Can someone care to explain to me:\n\n1) How this is at all surprising? He led the clownshow effort in the Senate to stop the certification of the electoral votes until Jan 6 made that politically unpalatable at the time. \n\n2) What consequences he will actually face if this is true? The GOP presidential frontrunner is already on tape scheming to steal the last election and he seems to be doing fine. \n\nColor me jaded but it seems like unless these traitors actually face real consequences for their actions, whatever is left of our democracy is currently transitioning from the FA to the FO phase.So fucking arrest him already JFC.How's this not treason?These people need to see the inside of a prison. There is no other option.This isn't the smoking gun people are trying to make it out to be. I don't see how this is any different than anything he said or would have said publicly. I know he knew the claims made by trump were b.s but he chose his words very carefully to make it sound like he wanted to get to the bottom of the accusations.\n\nThe headline and most of the comments make it sound like he said \"yeah so we're making up these bullshit claims and we're going to appoint a puppet commission to conduct a fake investigation to come to a phony conclusion based on lies and outright ignorance so that we can deny the legitimate election results and make big daddy err I mean trump prez forever \"\n\nI mean that's basically what he was saying but he intentionally worded in a way he could wiggle his way out of potential problems later.Has there every been something republicans have shouted about Dems doing that we didn\u2019t find out was a projection?As much as I\u2019d like to watch Ted Cruz walk barefoot across mile and miles of legos, there\u2019s nothing he said on those pieces specifically that are going to get him in any legal trouble at all - completely hedged his statementsBreaking news: prices for Cancun flights and hotels sky rocket \ud83d\udcc8I hate his beardIs it really a bombshell when we all new he was a piece of shit?Imagine a blithering idiot insults you and your family relentlessly and your response is to drop to your knees and fellate him like your life depends on it. Embarrassing.How are these people not being charged with treason?Maybe it's just me (correct me if I'm wrong), but does anyone here really think Cruz has the brains to steal an election? He's got a history of buffoonery and diarrhea of the mouth.\n\nEssentially, he ain't too bright.........So, her recordings show Cruz saying the exact same things he said at least twice publicly? What's the story?Texas is so far gone now I can't imagine what he could do to be considered unethical.Peanut butter and jelly caused the elderly lady to think about her past.I do not like that man Ted Cruz, I do not like his far-right views. I do not like his stupid chin, I do not like his smarmy grin. I do not like him with a beard, I do not like him freshly sheared. I do not like Ted Cruz at all, that man Ted Cruz can suck my balls.\n\nI do not like that man Ted Cruz, I do not like him in the news. I do not like what he just said, I do not like his boxy head. I do not like him wearing glasses, I do not like him kissing asses. I wish he\u2019d never get one vote, that man Ted Cruz can lick my scrote.\n\nI do not like that man Ted Cruz, I do not like his backward views. I do not like his stupid suits, I do not like his cowboy boots. I do not like him when he sneezes, I do not like him eating cheeses. I hate to see his dumb face smirking, because his beard looks like a merkin\u2019.\n\nI do not like that man Ted Cruz, I do not like his far-right views. I do not like him in these reeds, I do not like him when he feeds. I do not like him by a wall, I do not like this shit at all. I do not like him as Santa\u2019s elf, that man Ted Cruz can fuck himself.\n\nJohn Oliver\n\nEdit:thx for the silver!So? His voters don't care. Heck, this is probably what they want. \n\nHe will face no repercussions.More proof Ted Cruz is a coward, liar and traitor.\n\nwhat's next?   Water is wet?   Cement is heavy?\n\nLike who doesn't already know that Ted Cruz is one of the slimiest pieces of excrement,  currently oozing all over Capitol Hill?    They all should have been arrested for their roles  on Jan. 6th,  and sent to GITMO  to serve out their sentences.\n\nIt is an absolute DISGRACE  that  more than two years on,  not a single solitary lawmaker , senator governor or congressperson has paid the price for their role on Jan. 6th. \n\nWhat is Merrick Garland doing in his spare time?  selling Girl Scout cookies?   Where the HELL are the charges already?I can't wait till actual consequences happen to TedA person guilty of treason against the United States shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.  18 USC 2381\n\nCan't believe I have to argue Cruz is a \"person\".Wow, vote this piece of scum OUT!Treasonous Ted. I truly hope that becomes his nickname throughout the US and world. Even in Cancun.Lock his ass up.r/conservative: \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen\u201d\n\nThen: \u201cit happened by Democrats do worse\u201d\n\nThen: \u201cGod wants Republicans to be president.\u201d\n\nThe GOP doesn\u2019t need to destroy education; their voters already possess pudding brains.I wonder how many times this has been deleted from /r/ConservativeConservative subreddit being oddly quiet about this.Hello, I\u2019m a visitor from the future, and I\u2019d like to give you a heads up: nothing will happened to Dumbass Ted bcz Republicans don\u2019t see any issues with stealing elections if they\u2019re the ones who do it!This is capital high treason, as far as I'm concerned.  I would like to see all these inhuman traitors punished to the fullest extent of the law, **as non-violently** as ~~possible~~ necessary!Where is the audio of him supposedly doing this?  I went to the website and all I hear is him talking about investigating claims and how to make that happen.Oh wow.  Another rich politician doing things that would have us normal folk hung.  I guess we have to rely on the moral conscience of his followers to be smart enough to see what all the MAGA people were trying to do.  Holding breath,\u2026..If your still a republican your either an idiot or your profiteering.Proud to be a fascist\u2026Ok, someone needs to explain to me how this is at all significant. Cruz said all of this stuff publicly already.I guess no consequences breaking their oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, eh?I'd ask if aliens couldn't steal Ted Cruz - they don't even have to return him - but aliens deserve better than that.Wake me up when these people will reap the consequences of their actions, until then I don\u2019t believe any headlines.Is this a revelation to anyone that follows news, the bombshell is that we didn\u2019t have him on tape saying so. This is the guy that Trump called his wife UGLY and then bends over for DJTrump.Ted Cruz in the prison shower: \n\nPrisoner: \"My pronouns are Suck It..\"Where\u2019s this bombshell?? I hate Ted Cruz but if you read the article like I just did please tell me what he said in this recording that was illegalWhat? This isn\u2019t scheming to steal anything. Also, this is way old news. He stated his overt intentions to object to the results on his own podcast and explained his position as to whySure feels like we should be doing something a lot faster than we are. Especially when we have a red hot smoking gun in the killers hand on recording. BuT tHesE thInGs taKe TimENothing will come of it, damning as it is.\n\nVoters just don't care about political ethics anymore. I feel like we could have an open serial killer in Congress with 55% of the vote in their district at this point.He literally says in the audio there is no evidence but he hopes there will be. What is the bombshell? He mentioned all of these things in the audio before. \n\nWhat a fucking ecochamber this is.Listened to audio and read the article and as far as what the article says, there's literally nothing there. All Cruz said is that an election commission should be made and their recommendations be provided to the relevant states that will then decide what to do; also, the evidence needs to be credible enough to be used in a court of law.\n\nWhat am I supposed to be mad about? How is this a super secret plan to steal the election?But y\u2019all motherfuckers wouldn\u2019t vote for Beto because he gave gun owners the sads.Am I surprised?\n\nNo, not at all, not remotely.\n\nOTOH, fascinating how often Ted Cruz can sell his soul.What a stupid ass article where absolutely nothing was learned.That's not a bombshell, it's exactly what he did on camera on Jan 6th. We already knew this.Why is it when it comes to republicans it takes forever if ever they are held accountable, and Democrats allow them to deflect to stupid unimportant shit , every time proof of wrongdoing is found republicans counter with bullshit and Democrats lose there train of thought results in more time lost, nothing gets done , another important election is looming, with piles of evidence Trumps running for President again !!! And I blame This administration if he\u2019s available to campaign and possibly return to the Whitehouse instead of rulers!!!Sadly, this won\u2019t result in any consequences for Mr. Cruz. He, along with his party members and right leaning media pundits, will dismiss any evidence of wrong doing as fake news, and it will eventually be forgotten.Get back to me when they face any consequences at all.This is not a bombshell as it contains no no information. I hate Tes Cruz. But all of the contents of this audio has been public record for more than a year now. Great scoop Ari.What a shit headline. I\u2019m expecting an actual bombshell audio recording that clearly shows Ted Cruz blatantly and clearly trying to steal the election, you know, like the headline suggests?? The audio tape in no way, shape, or form is related in anyway to Ted Cruz \u201cscheming to steal the election\u201d\n\nFor anyone who didn\u2019t listen to the audio recording, what Ted Cruz said was \u201cI think the country deserves a thorough investigation into the claimed election fraud, and the mechanism to do so is to deny the Jan 6th certification\u201d\n\nMeaning if you have any brain processing power whatsoever, he isn\u2019t saying \u201cOh there\u2019s possible election fraud, let\u2019s deny the results of Jan 6th and INSTEAD elect Trump\u201d THAT would be overthrowing the election. No, what he\u2019s saying is that the claims should be thoroughly investigated before we move forwards with the verdict of Jan 6th, which if the claims were to be true, substantiated, and have serious evidence than that would be a very reasonable method, hell it would practically be the only method. (However obviously the claims didn\u2019t have credible substantiated evidence, but America didn\u2019t know that fully at that time)\n\nAlso, Ted Cruz LITERALLY said the exact same thing on live TV like 100 times. The. Identical. Thing. So why do we care now? And why are we making a fake headline up now? \n\nYou can make whatever *assumptions* you want, but that\u2019s not what he said. Period. The headline is garbage. Stop posting garbage fake shit. It\u2019s so predictable.DamnThanks Texas.This surprises me not at all. If he didn't do this, I misjudged him. Trump called his wife ugly; Cruz compliments him with a bureaucratic coup. That's real deal Ted Cruz. You could ask the guy to loan you $20 on a Monday, and on Tuesday he'd call you to help him carry a body out of the house, someone that he murdered for you. Real Ted.Nothing will happenIt does not matter because the republicans don\u2019t care. He will never refuse himself.NOOOO shit, BIG shocker there...So Cruz is heading to Cancun then, I'm guessing?The party is a cult. Trump humiliated him and his wife, they kissed the ring. The state was in crisis Ted went to cancun. There could literally be evidence of these guys have assaulted children and the children would be false flags and doxxed. When your followers are a cult you can really do no wrong. That includes cheating which these guys have both been outed and open about. The followers are unfazed.All for the guy who insulted his wife.Nothing surprises me anymore. I doubt this will even convince any of the election fraud believing Trump voters that the right is just as corrupt as the left. I\u2019m sure they will find a way to justify it.This will only endear him more with his constituents. I mean, his voters literally went to the Capitol on Jan 6 killing law enforcement officers to steal the election, he\u2019s really just on message here. By the way, have you heard about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop yet?\n\nYep, that\u2019s how it\u2019ll go.Abby GoatbergThis snake is always up to no good.You\u2019re a criminal, Ted.Holy.  Crap.   \n\nFuck these people.  Every.  Single.  One.  Knew trump was lying.  His lawyers, pence, Cruz, Barr. None of them called him out publically at the time.  Disgusting.Oh Lordy there are tapesThe special counsel for Jan 6th has already requested all her tapes.\\#567,234 confirmed cases of verified sedition by the republican party to destroy democracy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT, hunter biden had dick pics on his laptop and may have name dropped his dad for business interest. WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THIS INSTEAD!The ghost of Nixon when nothing happens: This is fucking bullshit!> she has NINETY different recordings.\n\nIs this how you magically have a fatal car accident?  I wouldn't want that info out there unless I was ready to release the tapes. \n\nOr does she expect someone to approach her to \"buy the rights\" to the tapes and then she clams up?Welp, that means that Fox is going to settle and part of the deal will be that the tapes never become public. If they pearned anything from Dominion, it's that they should've settled well before the dirty laundry was aired.I wonder if this is what took down Tucker.   She probably played snippets of recordings of Tucker back to Fox to show how strong of evidence she has and they fired him for something he said that would be damaging to FoxThe more I hear from her the less I sympathize with her. \n\nShe held onto this for 2+ years. She held onto it for this exact moment when Fox was looking for people to throw under the bus. \n\nIf her job wasn't imperiled, or if she wasn't being scapegoated, then she wouldn't have released this damning shit.\n\nShe isn't a whistle-blower. She's an opportunist switching her grift, which is such a time-honored  conservative tradition at this point that it deserves its own commemorative holiday. \n\nGriftmas?\n\nMoochtoberfest?\n\nBring Your Wiretap to Work Day?Another part of her lawsuit included audio of Tucker saying pedo-ish, creepy things like\n\n>reports that students at his teenage daughter\u2019s boarding school were \u201cexperimenting sexually with each other,\u201d \u201cIf it weren't my daughter, I would love that scenario.\u201dWell that's going to be problematic for both of those guys  \n\nEdit:  spare me the doomer takes.  I don't care how slippery you are, a DOJ appointed special council getting hours of secretly recorded phone conversations is not something you want to be a part of.  Yall need to look up the word \"problematic\" before shrieking *\"nothing will happen!\"*I want to believe.Jack Smith is turning into another Robert Mueller. Lately he's been asking for stuff only after it has surfaced in public. I thought he was out front in this work, but he seems to simply be chasing info that is already known. He should have been seeking out this stuff behind the scenes already. I'm losing confidence that Smith is going to do anything meaningful. \n\nNone of these \"prosecutors\" seem to have an understanding of the urgency. It's been 8 fucking years since the known Russian election interference, and our government is nearing collapse. An illegitimate SCOTUS, theocrats and Nazis in control of the House, and Dems unable to manage a divided Senate. \n\nSomeone else in another thread that we are a land mass governed by an economy. That's all we are now.He's not making these moves to make himself president but to make Trump president.  It is such a cravenly boot licking move to make given the context and history between these two men.i always knew he was a treasonous little shit weaselThis man took an oath to uphold the Constitution.It\u2019s called the Reichstag Fire option.So a Business Plot variant using the bureaucracy as the muscle for the coup?Unfortunately Cruz is tactful enough in these recordings that he probably can't be charged with the felonies his seditious behavior deservesWhy are people acting like this is a bombshell smoking gun \"we caught him\" type of thing? Everything being discussed is exactly what they were saying on the air in front of cameras while this shit was going on. Every single part of their attempt to override the will of the people and disenfranchise people who voted and flip states was done with a big bright spotlight aimed right at it.\n\nWhen the Republicans tried to refuse to certify the electoral college votes, the entire purpose was to kick the election back down to the states legislatures, because every battleground state has a majority Republican state senate, because for any state to be a battleground, it means a shit load of democrats live in a few urban centers, and the rest of the state's barely populated counties are all dominated by rural Republicans.\n\nThey were wide open shouting from the rooftops that they wanted to ignore the election results and have state legislatures hand the presidency to Trump. WE ALREADY KNEW THIS.I don't understand how this is any different then what we already know. The dude literally stood up in congress and said as much on January 6th.>\u201cCruz answers that this fake, made up, so-called commission that he and his Trump buddies were planning to try to create to bureaucratize a coup\u2014and that\u2019s what they were trying to do\u2014that was his answer, that\u2019s how they would steal this race.\u201d\n\nWait, so are these his exact words or is Melber editorializing?When I was in the military we'd be briefed by the FBI about avoiding foreign intelligence recruiting. The common theme was that it's an escalation game. If you're married you sleep with the wrong lady on deployment. Then they ask you to take a picture of a benign but secure location or they'll tell your wife. And then they ask for a classified document or they'll show your picture to your CO. \n\nIt never starts with, hey, give us national secrets. Whenever I see Trump, Cruz, Graham, etc. I know how they got to the point where they'll literally betray their country. \n\nThey aren't good people.In this case the \"going to bat for him\" and \"doing the same things as him\" are the same act though, and it doesn't really explain why Ted Cruz would do this in the first place. He used to be pretty anti-Trump, and Trump shit all over him leading up to the 2016 election. And then Cruz just magically switched to kissing the guy's feet. Is it really as simple as party over country? It feels like there has to be more at play here, like dirt being used against him or something. Because honestly I don't see what Cruz really has to gain by helping Trump versus throwing him under the bus or even just staying out of it entirely.They\u2019re know time is running out demographically. They\u2019re all in on the fascist thing. Because no one that has remained has the moral fiber or balls to do anything other than obey. As a kid I always wondered how Nazi\u2019s could have arisen in a country as rational and civilized as Germany. This is how.They\u2019re all fascist pieces of shit.  Not just Trump.  Not just elected GOP representatives.  Every.  Registered.  Republican.The republican emails got hacked the same time the DNC was hacked. Only one side has had their emails leaked. There's dirt everywhere on every one of the republicans. That's why they fall in line so well. Well at least until the maga extremists moved in wearing their dirt like medals of honor and acting wildly out of control.\n\nRepublicans are evil and vile asshole sores that want to abuse the system for all that it's worth. But there needs to be a system in place to abuse in the first place. The MAGA addiction to chaos ruins those plans.Not all of them. Former Speaker Paul Ryan is also guilty of plenty of shit, but at least he had the awareness to run away and hide. There's at least a tiny chance his grandkids don't have to let their family name die out of shame.You can thank Roger Ailes for stealing your father from you. All for a bit of fleeting power and wealth.\n\nIt's why what Republicans do is so unforgivable. It's not just grifting or stealing, it's that they've torn apart the fabric of millions of families, alienated fathers and sons, brothers and sisters. And reduced those under their sway to fearful, paranoid shadows of who they should be.\n\nThere is nothing a person like Roger Ailes or Tucker Carlson, or Bill O'Reilly or any of them can do to redeem themselves in this life.At the time, I felt like I was going crazy. Not many people were alarmed and acted like it was just normal politics. We survived a coup attempt. And you are right. People have been brainwashed so deeply, they just call it fake news. Or say that it's the Democrats setting up the Republicans. Truly insane. I'm sorry about your dad.How's he handling them firing their poster boy? The nearly 800 million they had to pay for lying?Trump also insinuated that Ted\u2019s father helped Lee Harvey Oswald assassinate JFK.You're assuming he gives a shit about his wife.  Sociopaths often don't.Lock him up? You know what the penalty for insurrection is\u2026We've got to be careful not to scare him. He has a history of fleeing to Cancun.Stuff like this is why his constituents vote for him. They want right wing authoritarianism by any means necessary.I despise that this man is \u201cmy representative in the senate\u201dI don\u2019t want down the headline but none of this was secret. He was saying these things in public around that time. I watched him say similar things on the senate floor maybe a day afterwards.But it might work.honestly the only thing that gives me any hope, morbid as it is, is the fact that the oldest generations are dying out and each passing generation is more liberal than the last\n\neven then this country might be fucked - and yet people still espouse edgy \"both sides are the same rhetoric\" in the face of actual fascismHe's right, though, he did. Cruz is not stupid. He couches everything in language that appears to protect himself. The fact is, though, that by Jan.2 dozens of courts of law had already determined that the claims were bogus and Cruz KNEW THAT. His bullshit lawyerly language should not absolve him.The Lincoln Project did a video on Brad Parscale skimming from the Trump campaign.She has NINETY recordings to release. Get ready for the show.I mean, it is kind of true. They did this whole coup in the open, there were plenty of the players involved that laid out their part of the plan on national TV/Twitter/etc. And despite that, the justice department has so far only gone after the rubes that stormed the Capitol despite not knowing the full plan.Well it does take the \u2018secret\u2019 out of secret coup.I dont like him, but at least from what I saw in the article he didnt appear to say anything illegal. Basically said he thought there was fraud/concerns with the election, and talked about what the legal avenues would be to fix that, and that they also needed credible evidence rather than just allegations. If he said something like, I dont care about evidence lets put our guy in as president, then thats more obviously illegal. But maybe with an investigation there will be evidence of a crime, I guess we'll see.I do not like him in the news\u201cThis guy\u2026. This is not my kinda guy\u201d -Frank CostanzaAl Franken once quipped, \"I like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz. And I hate Ted Cruz.\u201dThey CAN'T govern.Of course they don\u2019t want to govern. They literally have no policies designed to help anyone except their wealthy owners.Their voters probably support the planThank you for remembering. He went on the stump for Loeffler and Purdue harder than anyoneI\u2019m starting to wonder if there\u2019s audio in those 90-ish other recordings that has Tucker Carlson saying even worse shit. MSNBC hitting up Fox News late Friday to tell them they\u2019re going to press with a story and asking for comment, leading to an unexpected over the weekend firing of Tucker would make a lot of things make sense. It would also give Fox News \u201cWe didn\u2019t know, as soon as we did we fired him\u201d type potential coverage from legal ramifications idk.Yeah I just can\u2019t comprehend it.  I can see personal insults being \u201cforgiven,\u201d you both signed up for that, for better or worse.  But your wife?  I\u2019d NEVER forgive that. Cruz is an awful person in so many ways, but this is such a basic character flaw.> Even 20 years ago, and there would have been massive prosecutions and immense public outrage on both sides.\n\n20 years ago is 3 years *after* the Republicans stole an election in broad daylight and got away with it.In 2023 this is \"fake news\" according to my parents...It didShe only decided to help society AFTER they tried to throw her under the bus. She never intended to do anything with this information while they paid her.They want the same thing he does.Canada doesn't want him. Mexico said \"oh fuck no\". Russia thinks he's doing just fine.\n\n\nMaybe we should give Florida and Texas back to their original owners and let them deal with these fuckers.\u201cWhoa, whoa\u2026 let\u2019s not make this political!\u201dThat was around the same time the Republicans got rid of a Senator for cheating on his wife. And then he was seen later looking at my cat's butthole.\n\nSuch were the times.\n\n>!John Ensign is a veterinarian!<Beto won a higher percentage of votes from native Texans. Cruz won a higher percentage of votes from people who have moved to Texas. It\u2019s not really as much an issue of what Texans want as much as an issue of right wingers from all over the country flooding Texas pursuing some kind of right wing dream of guns and corporate ownership.6-7 years of this shit and not one of these assholes is in jail. You\u2019re absolutely right, no accountability\u2026none.You mean lying Ted the Zodiac killer?So, two things to bear in mind here moving forward:   \n1. The average centrist/republican fox viewer isn't as dialed in to the fact Jan 6 was a coup, and all their politicians interact with fox news anchor regularly and coordinate strategy.   \n2. The context is important.\n\nWhat this recording does is really emphasize in no uncertain terms how corrupt this was, and how this was unambiguously a coup. This may have been obvious to you for awhile, but a lot of people that should have been paying attention weren't.  So it's not a bombshell to you, but for the \"rational skeptical both sides\" crew it removes some of their plausible deniability.  Here's why:\n\n**What it appeared Cruz was doing to the uninformed with his original statement:** \n\nA politician observing the election and certain \"facts\" being reported, then organically deciding based on that reporting, they need to advocate for actions A, B, and C.  Then announcing what they think the next steps should be to the public and their colleagues.\n\n**What Cruz was actually doing:**\n\nA politician making their mind up in advance about what facts need to be disseminated in the media, regardless of whether they are actually facts. Then informing the media what to report, and how to make it look legit. Then laying out their plan, requesting the media adopt this narrative, and continue to coordinate so they can perform actions A, B, and C to further their agenda.  Then when the media didn't sign off on the plan behind closed doors, he instead decided to lobby for these actions on his existing public platform.  It's entirely possible, if he had more support from Fox, they would have played this much differently and been more effective at laying the groundwork for a coup.\n\nBasically it highlights how much of a pre-planned plot this was.  And how there is no separation between  right-wing media and right-wing politicians.Its thousands of redditors not reading the article and then coming to the comments to share their thoughts.One, *maybe* two days of performative pants-shitting on the major news outlets, until the next shiny thing comes along that will get clicks. Definitely nothing will come of it in any political sense. This will get him *more* votes.Per a comment above yours he already has. LET\u2019S HEAR IT ALLI do not like his far right viewsStraight to jail.It isn\u2019t. He said the same exact identical thing on live TV like 5,000 times and no one cared. However this time it\u2019s a \u201csecret audio recording\u201d so therefor we can twist the headline into complete fake news and everyone will go CRAZY!\n\nReddit\u2026. Dear god help them.There isn\u2019t one. This is just clickbaitThere is nothing. Ted Cruz literally said the same exact thing on live TV like 100 times, and none of what he said has any correlation to \u201cscheming to steal an election\u201d lmao. Reddit is just full of dumb desperate people.\u201cMan I sure hope there\u2019s evidence of fraud so I can justify my vote to not certify the election results after the fact!\u201dThis is text book click bait bsIt's sad that I always have to sort by controversial to get the facts about a reddit thread.It's all good if Republicans are talking about setting up \"election commissions\" to \"explore\" the voter fraud which has no evidence of existing? Adding unnecessary friction and barriers to the election based on some people saying there's fraud, no evidence at all of it, and that's a nothing burger to you? Come on, get a little context to put this in perspective.So without evidence, he wanted to potentially overturn or at least create an opportunity for overturning the election. \n\nIt wasn't a secret, though. We all knew this was their plan all along.You should also go to see his own defense on Twitter. The same time he also said the same things on the floor of congress as well as during press stops. \n\nIt's novel that we have phone recordings. But it wasn't a secret at the time, or at least by the very next day. \n\nHe retweeted this twice today. \nhttps://twitter.com/mikedebonis/status/1650997581340655616?s=20\n\nJust want to edit to add that I despise the zodiac killer. I'm just here to share facts so that you can also see them.>*It\u2019s got to be demonstrable facts that can be laid out with evidence because that\u2019s what a court of law is going to look to\u2014not just an allegation but actual fact.*\n\nI mean... if that's not the lawyer in him covering his own ass, I don't know what is. Unless there is some crucial context in the form of unreleased recordings or correspondence, or something else, this doesn't seem like the smoking gun the title makes it out to be.it shocks me that someone would vote for ted cruz over beto. that's like eating a tuna sandwich that was sitting on a dashboard all day in the texas sun because once you get immediate explosive diarrhea that lasts for a week, you get to keep your personal armory. just doesn't seem worth it.My Congressman thinks Trump should never admit he lost & continues to cast doubt on the election integrity.  It'd be too hypocritical for him to admit he lost, because Hilary once told Biden never to concede if he were to have to have lost the election.\n\nI noted one of Trump's campaign managers was on a late night (like 2am) news program hours after the last polling station closed complaining that Hillary hadn't yet called to congratulate Trump on his victory!  The anchor tried to talk him down.  It is late at night, I'm sure she'll call in the morning!  But the Trump guy wouldn't accept it.  \"NO!  She is destroying democracy!  She should have called the second the polls closed!  It's irresponsible to wait this long!\". \n\nTrump didn't call the second the polls closed...  It's been years and he likely hasn't called...  \n\nOddly my Congressman ignored the message when I asked about the hypocrisy in that....Not only did they not call him out, they jumped on his bus to feed the lie and the corrupt attempt to subvert America democracy- they\u2019re simply traitors to the nation.  For Cruz to sink so low after Trump\u2019s insults to his wife and disparaging his dead father\u2019s reputation, well that\u2019s just a whole different level of sniveling, submissive nastiness - the guy has 0 integrity.i mean, of course they knew he was lying. anyone with half a brain could tell he was making shit up. i feel like only some of his followers/voters actually believed it was stolen. \n\nthese politicians aren\u2019t that stupid. they saw an opportunity to grift and incite.Thank u. Case closed. All those mofos knew he was lying and playing dumb. Oh there was a steal going on, all those mofos stealing millions of $$ from those poor dumb ppl.A (former) Fox News employee acting as a whistle-blower is exactly what we need right now.\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if the Carlson firing was related to something they know is coming out.Although individual states have primary responsibility for conducting fair and impartial elections, the FBI becomes involved when paramount federal interests are affected or electoral abuse occurs.\n\nAlso [James Comey](https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/oversight-of-the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-7)The fox tapes>Oh Lordy there are tapes\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I heard that sentiment in the past 6 years then I'd have my house paid off by now2 LPs, 8 tracks AND cassettes! call now, operators are standing byMaybe they were recorded for \u201cinsurance\u201d so to speakI want this to be true. You have a source?It just kills me how these people pretend that nepotism is new, even though a lot of them are nepo kids themselves.The most frustrating thing about any Hunter Biden talk is that Jared/Ivanka _blatantly_ used Trumps office to enrich themselves. Investigate hunter Biden and penalize him if he broke the law, but good god can these people not clean up their own backyard first?This shit makes Watergate look like a joke.Nixon got to quit his job and live out of jail the remainder of his entire life.Dead man switch. She notifies everyone that if something happens to her, the people with the tapes (and there are multiple copies throughout the world) are supposed to release every single one to a public non-partisan journalism group. Bonus points for encrypting copies and have them ready to decrypt and release to peer-to-peer networks like torret networks if you don't check in every 24 hours.\n\n\nSure, you can fuck with her, but if you do, you lose the chance to actually sweep most of it under the rug.Her lawyer already has the recordings.  Removing her from the equation does nothing to make them unavailable, especially now that the special counsel has requested them too.  All it would do is implicate them further.That doesn't protect them from Jack Smith and his Jan 6 investigation, who has already contacted Grossman's legal teams for the recordings.I don\u2019t think the decision not to settle at first was because of Fox\u2019s lack of interest in doing so.Fox may want to settle, doesn't mean Grossberg does, especially if she has an ironclad case.Luckily, Smartmatic has a $2.7 billion lawsuit pending against Fox for the same thing Dominion sued them for.I hope Cucker retaliates against Fox. Love to see them take each other down.No. She turned it in two years ago. Fox is the one who hid discovery.I have zero sympathy for Abby Grossberg. She was a producer for the Tucker Carlson Show, and her job was to book his guests. She is Jewish person who willingly joined an openly white supremacist propaganda organization. Part of the reason that she is suing is because some of her coworkers made antisemitic comments around her. Sorry, but no shit.::Stares at sky, with watery eyes::\n\nI want to believe.Yeah Ted may only win re-election by 15 points this time. I mean really want to believe.Do you really think so? Legal cases are extremely hard to build in these circumstances, and I can almost guarantee you that their political supporters won\u2019t be swayedI just want to remind people of [this interaction between Cruz and a Trump supporter](https://youtu.be/MFaByBD3oWM) during the 2016 primaries, where Cruz tries to convince the man that Trump is an awful candidate. \n\n*\u201cDonald Trump is deceiving you, he\u2019s playing you for a chump.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cDonald cannot tell the truth, [for] one minute.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cSir facts matter, truth matters.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cLet me give you an example of Donald\u2019s problem with the truth\u2026\u201d*Imagine doing all of that for a dude who calls your wife ugly and tried to convince people your dad conspired to kill JFK. \n\nTed Cruz really is a piece of trash.I keep telling y'all that this Reek isn't getting a redemption arc.Once again proving that Ted is such a massive asshole that his spine fell out.\"men.\"\n\nLol.its just faster to say republicanRemember: the insurrectionists that broke into the chambers looked through Cruz's papers, and were happy when they realized that Cruz opposed the certification and was on the side of the insurrectionists.\n\n\u201cLook\u2014\u2018Objection to counting the electoral votes of the State of Arizona,\u2019\u201d the man says, adding, \u201cHe was gonna sell us out all along!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait no, that\u2019s a good thing! That\u2019s a good thing!\u201d a man in a MAGA hat assures the man in the helmet. \u201cHe\u2019s with us, he\u2019s with us.\u201d[deleted]It's clear what he's trying to accomplish but the little cuck weasel doesn't have the balls to say it explicitly.He said all the same things publicly before Jan 6th and on the Senate floor the day of Jan. 6th. Nothing in this article/tweets of recordings is new information. This was always his position. \n\n[WATCH: Sen. Cruz calls for commission to do emergency audit of election fraud claims](https://youtu.be/Q6b9Vcu-PYI) *on Jan. 6th.*That's what I was coming here to say.  I hate Cruz, but he weasel words this enough that it isn't the smoking gun I wish it wasThe latter. Nothing in the audio clips is any different than what Cruz said publicly at the time. \n\nThe Navarro clip is more interesting, but I dislike that they cut something in the middle\nhttps://twitter.com/TheBeatWithAri/status/1650996575739445250According to my bro, there's 2 main scams on people in the military & one is just tricking young guys with some money, to part with it. They'll ask for dick pics & then once sent, they'll say \"oh I'm underage, you better give me money or I'll report you/release it.\" The other, I personally dealt with because of my bro - someone (or a group) made an account pretending to be me & then started trying to talk to my brother, saying they know him through me. My brother believes it was Russia due to what was happening in the area the base was in & due to what his job was, at the time.I read something similar specifically about Graham. The gist of it was that whatever dirt they had on Lindsey was probably enough to put him *under* the jail. One week he\u2019s ranting about how Trump will destroy the GOP and the next week, after a round of golf with the orange turd over the weekend, he\u2019s talking about how great Trump is. \n\ntl;dr Whatever you think they have on Lindsey Graham, it\u2019s worse.Yeah, when I was brief by the FBI, they basically said you will lose your clearance if you: pretty much say anything that Trump has said about the  FBI and our government in general.Working with SAP stuff, we're briefed on similar things. The specific case of \"there's a foreign-looking girl who seems *real* interested in you...\" comes up often.There's that old theory that the reason the RNC emails didn't get leaked is because they were used for blackmail instead. \n\nLindsey Graham went from hating Trump to total subservience after a round of golf at Trump's resort. Still seems like a weird 'coincidence'.Everything they do is literally just about power.\n\nCruz \"magically\" switched sides for power. He suggested this coup, because if he succeeded, he would have power. Ted Cruz realizes he doesn't have a pathway to being emperor. But he'll make literally anyone into an emperor just to sit close to a throne.The only guy who I think Trump has actual dirt on is Lindsay Graham.  He literally begs people to donate to Trump on cable tv.  It\u2019s truly pathetic.  The rest are just terrible people and/or morons.Spot on. This is no longer hyperbole and everyone left of center should acknowledge this.Cult 101, isolationA guy that lives in the same building as I do recently told me that Kamala should be shot dead, and then Biden should be shot dead after her. In that order, so Kamala doesn\u2019t become president. Because of all the election fraud that stole Trump the presidency. He randomly brought this up out of nowhere. I couldn\u2019t believe he felt so comfortable telling me this. \n\nThese people are brainwashed beyond belief. You can\u2019t reason with them.My grandmother's funeral was stained by Trump flags. I can't even look at my grandpa without feeling disgust.Thank you for saying what I've been feeling so eloquently. These last years have done a number on my friends and family relationships. Almost everyone you talk to has at least one person who they can't reconciliate (on either side of the political spectrum). \n\nIt's not enough to call out the evil political actions, but to see the wider picture as well in these manmade microcosms of hatred. The damage is incredible.I sometimes wonder how bad things are in an alternate universe where the coup was successful.I\u2019m sure he hasn\u2019t heard about the settlement. And Tucker probably just got canceled by some woke antifas or something.In all honestly, Rafael probably took that as a complimentAnd was the zodiac killer.Or his daughters. When he fled Texas in the middle of the power crisis, he blamed his kids. Ted Cruz, like his idol Trump, is only loyal to himself and his own ego. These shitheads don't hesitate to throw anyone under the bus, even their own family.Power hungry sociopaths at least usually have enough of an ego that they understand a public insult to be an attack on their reputation, status, honor, whatever. \n\nAside from the normal loathing I have of most R congresspeople, Ted Cruz being so loyal to the man after such an insult to his family means my opinion of him goes so far into the negative it easily hits disgust. Seriously, I can at least somewhat understand somebody selling out and being a corrupt fuck if they do it to take care of their family. To only be looking out for yourself? Rot in hell.A few months or years in prison? That is the actual penalty for the convicted January 6 insurrections.Nothing...nothing for rich white peopleIt\u2019s not really his fault, the planet his species calls home is lush and tropical and the fear of being stuck in the cold without power for a heat rock and lamp was too much for him to take. \n\nhttps://www.tedcruzforhumanpresident.comLet him flee. What\u2019s he going to do from Cancun? Vote?If he would just stay in Cancun, I\u2019d fly him there myself.I mean, let's be honest: sometimes it's REFRESHING to be able to sit back, have some relatively menial orders barked at you, you do 'em, and that's the end of the day/week/month.  You did the thing, you don't have to actually *think* any more, your job and livelihood is secure, you don't have to sweat anything for a while.  \n\nBut it's *pretty* easy to go too far on these things, this \"mindless\" attitude towards life.  \"Okay, the Captain said we go in and kill everyone we see in this base, and we're done for the rest of the month!\"  Okay, but...the base was filled with refugees, innocent civilians at this point, you can't just-- \"LA LA LA, KILL EVERYONE IN THE BASE AND I'M FREE, I CAN'T HEAR YOOOOUUU\"\n\nThey don't *question* things because they're not supposed to.  So they don't.  And after a while, that sweet, sweet numbing of \"having to consider the consequences of your actions\" goes away because you can simply rationalize it as \"my boss told me too\".\n\nY'know who else used that argument, the \"I was just following orders\" defense?  The Nazis at the Nuremburg Trials.  GAWD, we're dealing with dipshits all the way down, aren't we?I got Lauren Boebert so I share your sentimentsExactly. They\u2019re willing to take power by force. The majority of Democrats aren\u2019t. This will turn into another Hong Kong situation if Dems don\u2019t quit dismissing the GOP as \u201cfinished.\u201dDon\u2019t feel bad. We\u2019re all thinking it.[deleted]Yeah, we already knew Ted cruz is a duplicitous piece of shit who tried to overthrow the election in plain sight. I actually agree with him for once that it\u2019s kind of silly we have headlines calling this a BOMBSHELL. Rachel maddow vibes. This is old news.And he got Tuckered shortly thereafter.I hope she's doing that thing where she leaves them enough rope to hang themselves and then trickles out a little more audio that completely contradicts whatever feeble defence they put forward. That's always my favourite.Yep, here's an article that was from before the election to back up your comment https://theweek.com/speedreads/939191/trump-campaign-reportedly-discussing-contingency-plans-bypass-election-resultsAgreed.  Ted Cruz is a piece of shit and I hope he goes down in court for his actions, but the recordings in the article aren't the smoking guns that the Daily Beast is selling them as.   Hopefully some of the other 90 recordings are.\n\nBut the 2 posted are basically the same legal argument that Cruz et al were making publicly around that time.   It's wrong and it's really bad legal theory that somebody with Cruz's experience should know better(and almost certainly does), but it's far far short of a confession. There wasn't any mustache twirling in the clips.I do not like his fascist viewsTelling us to face the wall counts as governing to themHe also had to chaperone Walker around with Lindsey Graham and that was hilarious and terrifying.Basic character flaw is the title of Ted Cruz\u2019s biography.I really want to believe Ensign serviced your cat's asshole after leaving Congress.Ted Cruz is the only American whose reputation would improve on all fronts if it was revealed he was the Zodiac killerI\u2019ll prob regret asking, but what is the connection with the Zodiac Killer? Lol I\u2019ve seen this posted about him three times in the last two days.I do not like them on a fence, I do not like them with Mike Pence.I think it\u2019s more that we already knew all of this. He was saying this stuff in public at the time. And even though this was and always has been worth being mad about, there isn\u2019t new information to be mad about.Are you represented by Doug LaRalpha as well? He's such a piece of shit.> Hilary once told Biden never to concede if he were to have to have lost the election.\n\nYeah, no she didn't. She said that if he was behind on election night, but it was still close, he shouldn't concede until all the recounts/etc were finished. She absolutely never said that he shouldn't concede a lost election.\n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-joe-biden-should-not-concede-on-election-night-idUSKBN25L2FJI don\u2019t remember this.  Was it Cory L?  Do you have a clip of this?Ted Cruz is one of the saddest, most spineless and dishonorable individuals in elected office in the US and he has a whole host of competition for that title. I've never read about anyone as pathetic as him and I'm flabbergasted he has supporters. Even Trump supporters think he's a loser. \n\nEnded up being more or less the biggest joke of the entire 2016 Republican nomination field.R voters have been sitting for a long time being told how they're the \"real Americans\", they are \"real America\", the silent majority, the moral majority, this majority, that majority.\n\nSo when they lose, even after putting forth someone intended to piss off as many people as possible, they  can't accept it.  There's also the angle that they are OK with the cheating, and so have the thought process of \"we cheated and still lost, so obviously you're cheating even more!\"I heard an interesting analysis on The Daily that the clincher for the Murdochs giving Pucker the boot was how he acted (and texted) like he was king shit and could do whatever he wanted and no one at the network had power over him.\n\nTo me, that fits.\n\nThe Murdochs and Fox yuckity yucks were cool with the lying, the racism, the cozying up to authoritarian assholes, etc.\n\nBut diss the boss?\n\n>Law 1:\u00a0Never Outshine the Master. Always make those above you feel comfortably superior.\n\n-*From Robert Greene's 48 Laws of Power (the kind of thing that would appear on bookshelves at Fox next to Ayn Rand and maybe the Bible)*Oh definitely. If half the rumors are true Fox is going to be in for a hard time.There's a few I've heard about, like Tucker making a comment about 14 yo girls being sexually active \"as long as it's not my daughter I'm all for it\" type stuff. I haven't heard any antisemitic quotes yet but I'm not the only person expecting to hear old school hard Jew & Black hatred. His American Nazi loving self should be outed. Fuck Tucker Carlson, traitorous racist prick.David Dole said anti-Semitic tapes maybe one of many reasonsI\u2019m willing to pay him to dish the dirt.Can we start the \"Lock him up!\" Chant yet?fucking Comey, I won't ever forgive him.Garland will wipe his ass with these allegations, where have you beenI love it. Especially late in the summer.No, they were recorded for transcription because she was the producer for both shows. Recording the pre-interviews it's pretty common. What's unusual in this case is that she turned the audio over and Fox News basically claimed they never got it.https://twitter.com/acyn/status/1650991342716067842?s=46&t=15EbhBzCEoCL9gMgNFcDDQAnd in this case it wasn't even technically nepotism, since it's not like Joe Biden pushed for Hunter to get his position at Burisma.\n\nHe got hired because of his name, but (at least, according to Lev Parnas, who is in a position to know) that was just a corrupt Ukrainian company thinking like a corrupt Ukrainian company in thinking that Joe Biden would be less inclined to take any action against them if his son was on their board. And Hunter, who was spiraling deep into drugs and whatever else at that point, didn't have the good judgment to refuse.\n\nExcept, of course, Burisma actively wanted to keep Viktor Shokin on as Prosecutor General, because Shokin was corrupt and could be kept from investigating them via simple bribery. He had threatened an investigation into them in the past, which was his MO: threaten investigations and use that as leverage to collect payoffs. So when Joe Biden led the charge, as Obama's VP, to get Shokin removed from his position, he was actually working against Burisma's wishes (not to mention, he had widespread support among pretty much the entirety of Europe).A lot of stuff they've done hasThis has been a recurring thought of mine and I don't understand how older people, boomers, don't see it.Ya, but none of these asshats will even have to quit.Interesting https://twitter.com/Victorshi2020/status/1651016612059942912Dominion wanted an apology until the last second.I think she kept them for protection against being fired. Now that she\u2019s been fired\u2026Not that I don't believe you, but do you have a source for that? This is so fast moving I'm trying to make sure I'm really clear on what happened.Abby has a shitload of tapes:  \"I have to go through them all\" .  Also has a tape of herself talking with Trump's aide Peter Narvarro concerning the 10's of millions left over in the \"Campaign Fund\".   More names revealed. \n\nPeter Navarro on tape blasting Trump's inner circle for failing to fully fund the effort to steal the election.\n\n[https://twitter.com/i/status/1650996575739445250](https://twitter.com/i/status/1650996575739445250)If Ted Cruz goes to jail it might be the first time I jerk off to a man.he won by 2.6% last timeIt won't, and the reason will be Fox News. Secret tapes buried Nixon. Now we are here 5 decades later, not wondering which tapes will bury a certain politician, but if the politician is popular enough to overcome. Trump is on tape saying that, since he is such an important person, he can grab women by the pussy. Legal cases don't matter. All that matters is who will vote for whom.Yeah this is exactly the kind of thing conservatives support. This won't impact his popularity in the slightest.Omg imagine the people in that video being your electorate and trying to reason with them.What happened to change his narrative from that reasonable one, into a trump boot licker? What information does trump have over him? Is it Epstein island shit?RNC hacked emails must be having Rafael all levels of scurrred for him to flip so fast.bro has a shame kink 100%He has to pick himself up from licking those bootsLmfao this should be the top comment\n\nWife ugly & father murderer. \n\nLets also not forget zodiac killer ted too lolOmg Cruz IS Reek lolNot an asshole, a **literal traitor to the constitution.**\n\nCruz should be ejected from Congress immediately and rot in a cell for the rest of his life or worse.Elderly man-children.But much less fun.Dude! That's offensive, just say the \"R-word\".He said this very shit on the senate floor, almost verbatim, how is this a fucking bombshell? Did no one actually pay attention during / after the election?Grossberg said in a separate interview on MSNBC Tuesday that she has at least 90 more unaired recordings that she needs to review.But this audio demonstrates a premeditated motive here, which should be much more substantial than just him pandering an in-the-moment 'we should do this' pitch he can weasel out of.Discord servers seem to be a common classified information sharing platform.Oh to be a ladybug on the wall for that conversation.There are a lot of old articles that describe Graham as being a hanger-on and willing to do anything to be part of the \"Big Boys Club\".  I honestly think that Graham just has no morals and he'll do whatever is expedient at the moment.\n\nOnce Trump is \"done\" he'll go back to shitting on him and sucking up to whomever is in the new GOP power player.Everyone forgets about David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer, Trump fixer, and domestic spymaster.Ted Cruz went from calling him every name in the book, to being forced to *phone-bank for him during the primaries*.  Whoever has all  the dirt, they have ALL THE DIRT, and they've let the higher-ups know it so they can wrangle the lesser-peoples into doing their bidding.\n\n(Rafael found out pretty quickly that he is *not* one of the higher-ups, and began furiously licking the boots of the man who publically insulted his wife.)>There's that old theory that the reason the RNC emails didn't get leaked is because they were used for blackmail instead.\n\n>Lindsey Graham went from hating Trump to total subservience after a round of golf at Trump's resort. Still seems like a weird 'coincidence'.\n\nThe wild part is that Graham's 180 was like within hours of that report on the RNC stuff not being leaked too>Lindsey Graham went from hating Trump to total subservience after a round of golf at Trump's resort. Still seems like a weird 'coincidence'.\n\nWeird coincidence #2, this was right after trump got back from the meeting with putin where he took the translators notes and ordered everyone not to discuss. \n\n...also, Lindsay Graham doesn't golf. Wonder why Trump wanted him out on the course having that meeting?That\u2019s fuckin interesting, man.Also that spit-take Anthony Kennedy made on camera shortly before resigning from SCOTUS. We would love to know what little quip Trump made to elicit such a reaction.Imo that\u2019s a theory the way gravity is a theory.\n\nSure, we don\u2019t know the exact specifics, but if I drop an apple it\u2019s gonna fall to the ground and republicans are Russian assets.\n\n(Okay not the *exact* same, but close imo)It's not Trump, its Putin. And don't forget the NRA and the Russian money being funneled through them to Republicans. There are A LOT of kompromised Republicans.He definitely had dirt on Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and his son to get him to step down\"Hello local FBI office? My neighbour is planning to assassinate the president and vice-president...\"You should have told him how full of shit he is. They aren\u2019t used to getting push back and they need the reminder that not everyone is as batshit as they are.Bet he wouldn't do it again if you called the police for him threatening to assassinate the president and vpI know there are literally countless examples of the Right's cognitive dissonance, but this one especially leaves me dumbfounded - ever since 2016 they've been regularly calling for people to be taken out in the town square and be shot, hung, etc, they're armed to the gills and fetishize weapons... and their common refrain is \"ThE vIoLeNt LeFt\". Like, for fuckin real?My dad was buried with his fucking red maga hat. I so wish he were alive to see his leader go down. I\u2019d ask him if all of this was worth destroying his relationship with his only daughter.But JFK was the most MAGA president ever and his son faked his own death so he could investigate the deep state and now he has all the information he needs to take down the evil democrats and he's going to reveal himself and be Trump's running mate and become vice president and make America great again and own all the libs and and and...  \n/sAnd apparently one of his kids is LGBTQ, and despite that he's still going along with the Republican platform on this (in contrast to famed heartless ghoul Dick Cheney, who changed his mind because it affected someone he cared about).\n\nThat's probably a great vibe around the dinner table when he's around.When discovered, he said he was just dropping of his daughter who really wanted to go. I guess when he drops people off he makes a habit of carrying a suitcase. Just in case he gets diarrhea and constantly shits himself, I can only assume.No-one convicted of Seditious Conspiracy has been sentenced yet.\n\nThe first people convicted of that crime will be sentenced in May.Death. The penalty is death for treason.I love this damn website and I swear I hope whoever made it never stops updating it. \n\n\u201cI will now slumber for an amount of time you would consider reasonable\u201d kills me every time.I have seen many people and Ted Cruz is one of them lolI got Lindsay Graham, I wish I could yeet him into the sun.2.5 million a year. That\u2019s a lot of Trump voters.I\u2019m surprised I had to come this far in the comments to see this. Reading the article had me confused as to why this was a bombshell or a \u201csecret\u201d recording. \n\nCruz is a total Trump-ass-licking POS, but I didn't hear anything in that audio that was different from what they all have been saying publicly. Not that what they\u2019ve said publicly is okay, but I don\u2019t see how this is a bombshell.  He even says \u201cI want to make sure we do this constitutionally\u201d (paraphrasing) so it\u2019s not like he said something like \u201cI know the election was legit, and I dont care what the constitution says.  We need to overturn this election no matter what.\u201d\n\nIm sure I'll get downvoted for saying this, but if I'm missing what is so bombshelly about this, please set me straight. I want these guys to go down.Better have those tapes somewhere safe or they'll Epstein herNot on a plane or Cancun cruise. I do not like this man Ted Cruz.ruse works well tooTed Cruz is the Zodiac Killer.\n\nCan't prove he isn't.\n\nI have also heard people saying that Ted Cruz pisses his pants on purpose because he enjoys the warm feeling on his legs.Haven't you seen the sketch of Zodiac Killer ? And matter of fact Ted likes the joke.You're right. This doesn't seem to be substantively different than the statement he signed onto.LaMalfa?  Other side of the country from him I'm afraid.\n\nA year or two ago my guy was making a big thing about how he was fighting to make sure our tax dollars weren't wasted...  Awesome.  But he was supporting H.R.2729, the Finish the Wall Act.  Spending trillions a year on a wall that will do little to nothing to prevent the spread of drugs or illegal immigration doesn't really sound like and effective use of tax payer money IMHO.\n\nHe explained he thinks it's important that we show the rest of the world the United States is a land of laws & that we take our laws seriously....  \n\nBut yet, he apparently has no qualms allowing MTG stay a member of Congress....  Even though she herself publically posted a video on Facebook saying she just got done helping Trump & co actively plan for the events of 6 Jan and encouraged everyone to come \"fight like hell\" to make sure Trump is named President (aka actively planned & recruited for an insurrection).  She's been pushing for unconstitutional actions like a \"national divorce\" or making the United States a Christian Nation...  Match 15th during a Homeland Security hearing she actively divulged classified information (and it most certainly wasn't an accidental slip of the tongue) ...Rick Wilson: \"Ted Cruz is sort of a political force of nature. He is what he is. You either hate him or you hate him.\"\n\nLindsey Graham: \u201cIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you\u201d.\n\nAl Franken:  \"I like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz. And I hate Ted Cruz.\"Tucker knew this at one point he down right admitted it on a radio interviewThat\u2019s why all this talk about Fox going downhill over this is an absolute joke.  Ask Bill O\u2019Reilly and Glenn Beck how it went for them.  Murdoch doesn\u2019t give a fuck.I heard a similar one, they pointed out that this isn\u2019t terribly dissimilar to what happened to Beck and O\u2019reilly.There is a very recent article explaining that using religious rhetoric creeps out Rupert Murdock.  Tucker was using more and more religious rhetoric on his show.\n\n[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-prayer-talk-rupert-murdoch\\_n\\_64485587e4b03c1b88c9e15b](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-prayer-talk-rupert-murdoch_n_64485587e4b03c1b88c9e15b)\n\nKinda weird that Rupert Murdock has such a hangup.  It strongly suggests to a religious person that he's demon possessed.We needed another season of Succession with this plotlineThis reminds me of a time I ruined a date by saying \u201cYou have 48 Rules of Power? Did you know that\u2019s the most checked out book in US prison libraries?\u201d>(the kind of thing that would appear on bookshelves at Fox next to Ayn Rand and maybe the Bible)\n\n The Bible would be the fake book that's actually a lever that activates a secret doorway, because no one at Fox would ever actually pull it off the shelf to read it.I had heard previously that the Murdochs didn't want care for him (was mutual). The sons in particular wanted to rein him in for a while. It really could be just about anything or the culmination of everything that led to his firing. The settlement, the bullying and harassment claims, the content of his communications, etc.\n\nI do think wanting to reassert control over their network was probably part of it. This was a big power play, and it says to all of the other talent that no one is too big to be dismissed. This will help them keep control for years to come.Apparently, me too.what are the Carlson rumors?I'm looking for an erection that'll last 4 hours what rumors are you talking about?what are the rumours?Roger Ailes was forced to resign as chairman and CEO of Fox News after a sexual harassment lawsuit was filed against him by a former anchor, and many female employees were willing to testify against Ailes in the case.\n\nMurdock was afraid that half of Fox News viewers are women and would boycott the network. \n\nI think it was the upcoming lawsuit over a hostile work environment created by Tucker Carlson that prompted the firing.\n\nOh, and fuck Tucker Carlson, traitor and disgusting piece of sh*t.Shockingly it's an old comment from 2019: https://wapo.st/446okW8\n\n> Then, in an October 2009 show, Bubba the Love Sponge launched into what appeared to be a hypothetical description of the young girls at the boarding school attended by Carlson\u2019s daughter experimenting with each other sexually.\n\n> \u201cI ain\u2019t got my mom and dad here telling me that they love me and tuck me in bed,\u201d the radio host said. \u201cSo, here\u2019s Trixie, she wants to explore my body a little bit, so hey, let\u2019s go crazy.\u201d\n\n> Carlson responded: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t my daughter, I would love that scenario.\u201dI\u2019m not sure any of those are going to get him fired from Fox though.Those were public comments [made on a radio show 10-15 years ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/11/tucker-carlson-calls-women-extremely-primitive-newly-surfaced-audio/).\n\nFrom the linked article:\n\n>In a statement emailed to The Washington Post on Sunday, Carlson took a defiant stance.\n\n>\u201dMedia Matters caught me saying something naughty on a radio show more than a decade ago,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than express the usual ritual contrition, how about this: I\u2019m on television every weeknight live for an hour. If you want to know what I think, you can watch. Anyone who disagrees with my views is welcome to come on and explain why.\u201d*Let\u2019s lock up the \u2018leader\u2019 first so they can become cell mates :)Deport him back to his birth country.Does Cancun extradite?Seriously. I want that \"lordy there are tapes\" shit to disappear so I don't have to think of that rat fucking bastard.Jack Smith won't.>I love it. Especially late in the summer.\n\nDon Jr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I love it. Especially when it's in powder form and I can put it up my nose.\n\nAlso Don Jr. (probably)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I learned it by watching *you, Dad!*\n\nDon Jr. (almost certainly)It'd be a dream if Ted Cruz went down with this ship, tooIs it actually huge if he doesn\u2019t put \u2018fucking\u2019 between holy and shit?Yeah but Dominion is owned by a private equity firm and their business has been decent since 2020. \n\nSo they may have gotten way less in damages as compensation years down the line amd stood up for democracy...\n\n...or taken the guaranteed payout now, appease their investors, and sleep at night telling themselves they made their point...Yeah. Feeling pretty let down by that. They had them over a barrel.Two weeks ago she signed a sworn statement testifying that she had a phone that she told Fox she had, but they never asked for it back. She recently took it to a forensic expert who pulled two recordings off of it, this being one of them.\n\nFrom [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/media/fired-fox-news-producer-says-found-evidence-relevant-dominion-case-rcna80134):\n>Grossberg, in the new affidavit, said a forensic expert recently pulled two recordings off the broken phone that she recorded using an app called Otter, which simultaneously records and creates text transcriptions of audio files. The recordings, which she details in the affidavit and audio of which was shared with NBC News, are of phone interviews she participated in with Bartiromo: one with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and another with two sources who claimed to know about Dominion voter fraud.Yeah, working for authoritarian, anti-democratic demagogues and working in a misogynistic, racist, hostile workplace only became a deal breaker for her when they stopped paying her.\u201cFailing to fully fund the effort to steal the election\u201d is the most Trump thing ever tbhHope she has some security.straight up admitting that the campaign money is just a slush fund to pay themselves millions of dollars.It's his villain origin storyThanks to a horseshit educational system for the past 40 years, we are officially too stupid to be a democracy.Nothing that dramatic. He just read the room and realized that he needed to change his stance if he wanted to continue having a career in politics as a Republican. Unlike Mitt Romney, he didn\u2019t have the luxury of being more popular than Trump in the state he represented.And we can't even shame him for it because he'd like that a whole lot.Apparently that's what Texas is... They keep electing him.\n\nIn before \"but I'm a good proud Texas boy and none of us like him\", talk to your neighbors and look at what's going on in your state... nothing you can say to me changes that.He\u2019s gotta lift those boot straps so he can make sure he gets the bottom too.The entire GOP is ReekNah, Reek didn't know what he was getting into. Cruz is not a tragic character>Elderly man-children.\n\nYou misspelled traitors.They SIGNED a fucking DOCUMENT to 'just ask questions' about THE VOTES of the several states.\n\nCruz, Hawley, 6 more senators and 130 congress rioters were PREPARED to make it LEGAL. Chuck Grassley knew Pence was gonna miss class. \n\nEveryone on Facebook knew. Everyone besides the Attorney General and the entire 'news' media knew exactly what the fucking traitor terror plan was.\n\nWe will never forget when Republicans killed cops to crown their king.> Did no one actually pay attention during / after the election?\n\nThe GOP is still running the Steve Bannon play of \"Flood the Zone\"...  Just put so much shit out there that it's impossible to keep track of until people eventually give up.\n\nCan you honestly say you remember EVERY SINGLE thing the GOP and Trump has done to weaken the country from now back to 2015?Why do I have a feeling this will be the first case of a politician publicly saying this I created by AI and fake to further sow chaos. \n\nI have no doubt cruise said these things but recordings are about to come to an end as evidence and these fucks will happily and openly discuss these plots.Also Warthunder and World of Tanks lmaoYou mean the same David Pecker that has recently testified in New York and whose testimony was also forwarded onto Jack Smith??\n\nHave to give it to these rats, when they finally flee they all flee together\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/david-pecker-national-enquirer-trump-hush-money-grand-jury-1234704557/amp/What a fucking Pecker.Think that makes Trump\u2019s most immediate criminal proceeding more perilous for him than perhaps most imagined?The thing is, regardless of what the dirt is....I somehow doubt it's as bad as this. They've sacrificed everything they were and could possibly be, to suck Trump's dick over dirt that is arguably less than what they have done to protect it.\n\nIf I'm wrong, just imagine what they could possibly be hiding that it's *worse* than trying to steal elections and destroy the foundations of the country.\n\nWhich is the worse reality? One of them has to be true. Either the dirt is so overwhelmingly powerful that it's worth trying to destroy the country over, or they turned into traitors for something not really that bad in the grand scheme of things. I'm not sure which path is worse, to be completely honest.Trump called Cruz\u2019s wife ugly to Cruz\u2019s face. And Cruz just kept on keeping on. Never forget.Remember when Trump gave out Lindsey's phone number?My theory is that the dirt on Graham is obvious.\n\nHe's closeted gay which his voters are fine with because they can ignore it and he doesn't \"rub it in their face\". \n\nNow if pictures or videos were made public, his voters might be forced to deal wtih that disonanse and would likely demand him stepping down to replace him with some maga republicanI'm sure it has nothing to do with a golf course being a giant open space where it's hard to get close to somebody to potentially eavesdrop. It's why I do all my friendly meetings with casual acquaintances in a bathroom with the faucets running full blast.There\u2019s also the old idea that you can keep a politician in your pocket through flattery, campaign contributions, bribery, and blackmail with blackmail being the most effective in getting your desired outcome. If corporations, special interest groups, or wealthy individuals wanted to get officials elected that they could control, it would make sense that it be someone they can blackmail to ensure the politician doesn\u2019t change their mind or cost after getting elected. The Republican Party is the party of big donor money yet not a single piece of dirt came out when they\u2019re mail server was hacked and suddenly lots of R\u2019s changed their tune on TrumpThanks for bringing this up. SCOTUS is so fucked, there must be something that can be done to bring balance and apolitical justices back.I swear the whole Mueller report got so swept under the rug but there was crazy shit in there. Especially the bit about Russian hackers paying Americans to riot at BLM protests in Ferguson and Baltimore in 2015.\n\nEdit: typos.And it's all just weird sex stuff. The left side of politics is actually starting to understand humanity and sexuality and are embracing that humans deserve to live freely and openly as long as they don't hurt another person.\n\nRight wing people need to hide it because they can't process their shame. Instead it becomes projection.This was after talking about finding his new church to where he\u2019s moving to and has already started volunteering with them. It would have been pointless to try to engage. I just responded with that I would never condone violence like that and ended the conversation.Just wow. I\u2019m sorry.Someone once called JFK Jr \"MAGA Anastasia\" and I can't get it out of my head.It gets worse. The lgbtq daughter has tried to kill herself. No prizes for guessing whyThe Justice Department put out a statement in Nov that it\u2019ll be a fine & no more than 20yrs.\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/two-leaders-oath-keepers-found-guilty-seditious-conspiracy-and-other-charges-related-us#:~:text=The%20charges%20of%20seditious%20conspiracy,of%2020%20years%20in%20prison.I bet you $100 that they will not be sentenced to death. Is that what you\u2019re insinuating?Over cook chicken? jail\nUnder cook chicken? jail\nTreason? Believe it or not, not jail.My favorite bit is probably \u201cOpportunistic children capitalize on BEACH's looser restrictions surrounding behavior. They can and will attempt to take your egg.\u201dIf she's smart she'll have set up a dead man's switch of some kind. Give copies of the tapes to her lawyer, a journalist, or a loved one (maybe all of the above) and tell them to dump it all online if she ever dies/goes missing.Let me just say, this is the best Dr Seuss riff I've seen all weekBoofing Kavanaugh wearing only shoes.Now Imma do my trump impression: I do not like his wife that moosTed Cruz pisses his pants on purpose because he enjoys the warm feeling on his legs! \n\nHeard it from a very reputable advice podcast!Are you not allowed to type out your congressman's name?Sean Hannity, that cockroach, continues to survive.I think there's a pretty big difference. Back then, Fox was driving the bus. Now they're chasing it. The wackjobs don't look for what they want, they DEMAND it and if Fox won't give it to them there's all the new mini-Foxes that will.I love how I no longer associate those names as much with the bullshiters as I used to.\n\nFor me, beck is the band/singer again and O'Reilly is the older company with all the animals on books for programming and stuffMmm.. it\u2019s different, very. \n\nBeck, due to his endless conspiracy theories, caught the ire of a group called \u201cColor of Change\u201d who enlisted some 300 advertisers to stop buying time on Beck\u2019s show \u2014 which had already been influx with ratings due to his outlandishness. \n\nThe lack of ratings and advertising revenue made him an easy choice to let go. \n\nO\u2019Reilly was a walking misogynist: he\u2019d amassed some two decades of sexual harassment and threatening women with violence if they crossed him \u2014 his ratings were wonderful, but he hemorrhaged advertisers after his lawsuit brought everything to light. \n\nWere either of these two as arrogant as Carlson? \nNo doubt, yes. \n\nDid all three think that they were practically untouchable? \n\nWith those salaries, and no one correcting them, hells yes. \n\nThe primary tying element for all three would have been money lost to Fox based on Carlson\u2019s texts \u2014 without them seeing the light of day, he\u2019s still employed because he didn\u2019t do anything else to cost Fox money.That shit burns his ears every time like hot pokers shoved into his brain. He's a demon, after all.To me in strongly suggests he puts up with evangelicals because they are useful idiots for his \"I get to do whatever I want and keep all my money\" platform.He\u2019s Australian, where they don\u2019t have an evangelical religious right like we do in the US.So fucking hardHow long until we need to call the doctor? Because it has been going strong since they announced his firing.[deleted]Well it seems almost certain that he's been sexually harassing his staff[The other rumour is he upset Rupert because Rupert's ex-fianc\u00e9 adored Tucker](https://twitter.com/lrozen/status/1650963795324334116)He open-mouth kissed a horse once.I don't know but we should start one involving Matt Gaetz.  Remember that really weird interview. . .> Roger Ailes was forced to resign as chairman and CEO of Fox News \n\nYet he still got $40 mio. as a goodbye present and was re-employed as a consultant for Fox until his death... I bet he felt so much punished.But they won\u2019t. The women that love Fox News are in full support of the patriarchy and eat that misogynistic shit up. They all feel they are the special ones who it somehow doesn\u2019t apply to.Omg, please let it be true that Bubba the Love Sponge took down that little bow tie dick weasel.This wouldn't be like, sexualizing kids now, would it?\n\nEdit: spellingWhat got him fired was shit-talking management, and setting up Fox to play defense in their fourth sexual harassment lawsuit in 15 years. But mostly shit-talking management.Yeah, they're fine with anything that boosts the bottom dollar, so it's gotta be something hurting them financially -- or hurting the people that *pay* him, politically -- that saw him get the send-off.  So...mebbe it's the texts calling out his network (see: \"the bosses\") as incompetent assholes?Oh my god they were cell matesIt'd be like a cringy version  of that scene from 'the usual suspects'. With Donnie ranting about how everyone else is an idiot and the zodiac killer just sitting with mournful eyes looking at the distance, thinking I should have been in Cancun right now.They\u2019re all gonna start to eat each other, lol.The SNL scripts are writing themselves.No fuckin way\u2026 you got him now\u2026 you keep him\u2026 we have enough of our own morons up here.please no. can we work together on this? there has to be some other country we can give him to. maybe russia wants him?Remember when he hid behind a fucking curtain?Let's hope jack smiths boss isn't as lame as merrick garlandWhat they said about Mueller, What they said about Garland.Sometimes you have to leave out crucial words to make sure it fits a single tweet.The thing people need to remember is that Dominion is a corporation and they never cared about making a point.\n\nIf you guys thought voting machine companies were on your side, I have really bad news about the last 20+ years of behavior from that industry.I\u2019m sure Susan Collins will say that they learned their lesson.She\u2019s just another rat trying to save her own skin after getting kicked out of the club.\n\nAnd honestly unless they released more audio that I haven\u2019t heard, this recording of Cruz isn\u2019t anything that he didn\u2019t actually say publicly.  This \u201carticle\u201d is pure water carrying for this sack of shit fox producer trying to save her career/cash in one last time.\n\nHere\u2019s a how a non-clickbait publication reports on this:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/25/ted-cruz-fox-election-fraud/Right like any other fucking fascista would have atleast paid fully to get a coup. \n\nWhat a piece of orange shit.It\u2019s sad that this was my first thought as well. Get yourself and those tapes into DOJ custody asap.Abby Grossberg, American hero, defender of democracy from those that wish to destroy it. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85If we made voting mandatory in USA like in Australia, then there would\nBe more actual representatives that look like how Our society actually is. Not a bunch of rich ignorant idiots that\nSell their soul for right priceThe GOP is RamsayYup Reek actually did his best to redeem himself in the end and atone for his sins.  People like Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Ron Johnson will go their death beds doing whatever it takes to try and own the Libs.\"As bad as this\"? Let's be real, do his voters actually care about this at all? What we're hearing about right now is political dirt, not personal dirt. People, especially conservatives, care about personal dirt a lot more. If they found out Ted Cruz tossed a man's salad once, his political career would be dead. On the other hand, this election stealing business is barely news to them.It has to be something they're terrified would cost them their job or freedom.\n\nMaybe its just weird sex stuff at the crazy cocaine bender gangbang or w/e shit they do.\n\nMaybe its recordings of them shitting on their own voters for being idiots and talking about how badly they're fucking them over.\n\nMaybe they're all pedophiles and they've been projecting the entire time with the groomer / pizza child sex cult shit?Calling it now, they diddled kids. Or something of that caliber\u2026You assume the likes of rafael ted cancun cruz have any values whatsoever. He got the spine of a blob of 6 months old milk. He would instantly sell his own family if it meant he can cling to a bit of power and effortless income a day longer.\n\nLook at the people that worked to make childs labor legal again, some of them got as little as 4k$ for that. Elected officials are openly bribed with pocket change into hurting evryone.Correlation isn't causation but yeah they did thatHacked by Russians, perhaps?Thank you. It didn\u2019t happen without my protest but of course my enabling mother was all \u201cbut it\u2019s his favorite hat!\u201d \ud83d\ude44 And was I supposed to argue further with her at her husbands funeral while she was going through the worst time of her life? I couldn\u2019t bring myself to it, but in hindsight, I wish I did protest it a little more. It\u2019s probably better he\u2019s dead during a the downfall of Trump and his klan. He was so gleeful about my rights as a woman being stripped away, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019d double down on this fascism stuff and I\u2019d have hated him even more, if that\u2019s possible.And he didn't even go home to see her.My heart just sank. Went from a little mischievous twinkle in my eye from some good ole Cruz roasting to completely deflated and heart broken for his daughter (really, both sisters). I hope she is able to find a support system of chosen family and flourishes despite this asshole. \n\nI can't imagine not only your father not supporting you (which I don't have to imagine) but also actively whipping up half the county to be calling for your head simply for being who you are.Id bet even more than that, mass death sentences will definitely not be popular with the American or International community.I saw opportunistic children and was pleasantly surprised by where it ended.Not with a boof or acting troupe, in a car or a spring break bar, I do not like this man Ted I said.Does Ted Cruz piss his pants on purpose because he enjoys the warm feeling on his legs? I\u2019m just asking questions.The suspense is killing meStill waiting on that waterboarding, Sean. It's been fourteen years.He's like the herpes.Wears a CIA pin on his lapel every night. The guy never even finished college.Foxlets, if you willThat is how it appears right now. Be wary of underestimating the Murdoch empire, though.

But so am iI'm going to wait until November 2024 just to be safe.It's not like youd expect them to believe in diversity and inclusion.Reading all of that has given me a headache. I made it through 88 out of 102 pages.I\u2019d bet money on it. He\u2019s a pig. Maybe it will all come out now. And maybe that\u2019ll wipe that smug, shit-eating grin off his faceIt can\u2019t just be his constant use of the c-word and misogynistic comments. It has to be way worse than that.He was a sexist and racist bigot in just about every segment. He was caught with a writer that was a literal Neo Nazi. There should be no doubt that Carlson was likely inappropriate in the work place.That\u2019s\u2026. definitely pretty scary.\n\nAlso, the 92 year old broke it off with his fianc\u00e9 after *two weeks*. Yup, sure sounds like a keeper!  /sYea, that was wild reading.Jesus, I can't believe that I read that and found myself empathizing with Murdoch in being freaked out by Tuckems and Murdoch's fiance going full Left Behind.Murdoch created a doomsday cult.Did he kiss Majorie Taylor Greene?A M\u00f8\u00f8se once bit my sister.Let's not get carried away and cheer for another bad guy here.Fourth that wasn\u2019t settled out of court.  There are dozens of settled sexual harassment complaints.Yeah, I think people are forgetting this because its not fresh and in front of us. His texts are seriously what definitely helped torpedo Fox in the Dominion suit. He cost them almost a billion dollars. And all he did was speak the TRUTH to his inside group.

Can we just launch him into the sun?Remember when he lambasted a candidate a few days before the election even though that candidate had committed no crimes and had been handling materials the same way the previous administration had?\n\nThen the fascist you're responsible for giving power fires you unceremoniously and you... write a book and say things that are frankly more sober and less emotionally charged than the language you used against the non-criminal candidate days before an election.No, please tell me there is a videoI see what you did there\u2026 lol. Yep, ultimately Garland gets to screen and approve everything just like Barr did to Mueller.Mueller tried, his shit boss was a snake, as was comey, but comey even tried to warn us he was a snake before hand, I can\u2019t remember that weasel looking fucks name, but they narrowed the scope to a point that handicapped mueller. \n\nHis report showed evidence of guilt, and then Barr\u2019s justice deot just ignored it knowing republicans don\u2019t care about that stuffHow to Coup on a Shoestring, for Dummiesjesus christ are we 'allowed' to call them fascists yet?

Compulsory ranked voting!Trump is Ramsay. Putin is Ramsay's dad. The GOP are the people of House Bolton.This is facts as fuck.\n\nAnd there is _nothing_ that will enlighten someone who still says they're a Trump supporter.\n\nThe man could be in 4k video mowing down civilians and fox news would say he's attacking antifa himself and these idiots would love it.They don't care about personal dirt either, they will tie themselves in knots making excuses for any behavior from their \"team\"You don't motivate Cruz with shame, you motivate him with power.\n\nThe stories about Boebert being an escort for Cruz before getting her seat make more sense to me than some blackmail of wrongdoing.You should sporadically put rainbow flags on his grave.But that's what the Founding Fathers wanted!!Oh these people want mass death sentences... just not for themselvesI do not like him here nor there. I do not like him, anywhere.lol when that shit was happening I had a roommate claim that \"it's not so bad!\" so I told him to nut up or shut up and let me waterboard him.\n\nWhen I was at work, that fucker let our other roommates do \"waterboard lite\" to him, where they laid him down (horizontal), and splashed water on his face.\n\nWhen they told me and described it I was mad because, first off, I wasn't there to see it happen.\n\nAnd then, what they did definitely wouldn't rise to the point where you could seriously call it 'waterboarding', because it requires:\n\n- having your hands bound (produces a psychological lack-of-freedom effect)\n- the surface (board) you are on needs to be slanted *down* towards your head, preferably at like 30 degree angle or more (so higher blood pressure in your face and brain).\n- a cloth over your face (to blind you *and* so that your facial nerves keep detecting the presence of water, and all air you pull in will be high in moisture content)\n- someone dumping a *shitload* of water on your face. Like, a bucketful at a time.\n- if you really want to make it realistic, have extremely loud noises (bad music, random industrial noises, etc) while the 'interrogator' is screaming confusing questions at you.\n\nBut this guy managed to convince our other 3 roommates to do this 'lite' version to him.

We need to call it out and scream it from the rooftops.Problem with his supporters and pretty much all of GOP supporters for past 15/20 years is they live in this bubble of confirmation bias. They only watch \u201cnews\u201d (if you can call it that) or read articles that support their own views and preconceived theories however fictional and absurd it sounds. They don\u2019t let any other news, or people with differing opinions in. It\u2019s extremely immature like putting their fingers in their ears n screaming lalalala if the truth ever wafts by. It\u2019s sad n ignorant AF.bipartisanship? yes.  that's a good thing regardless of all of this\n\nbit there'd a difference between trying to get two sides of a political system to come to an agreement vs harboring and facilitating traitors & bad faith actors.  we need to get rid of the cancerous politicians *so that we can return* to a true two party system (ideally more than two, but baby steps). we don't need to be of the mindset that there should only be one party; that's a very dangerous thing.So many backups\u2026There was that gun nut who had his own child die in a school shooting and said the solution to dead kids was looser gun laws.By musket rounds?In a coup? Would you, could you, in a coup?I have never once even seen an O\u2019Reilly where I live but Lord have mercy, I hear that jingle in my head right now.Hard for me to forget Bill, some of the best memes quotes came from him.\n\n\"Fuck it, we'll do it live\" \n\n\"The tides go in, the tides go out... you can't explain that\"Or \u201c\ud83c\udfb6JG Wentworth \ud83c\udfb6 877 cash now!!\u201dThere was one time I was driving with my brother and an O'Reilly's commercial came on, my brother cranked up the radio and said it was his favorite song. With the amount of time we spent at parts stores around that time I could believe him. The lesson from this is never buy a Jeep.I think a big takeaway is that, in reality,  the majority of folks tend to turn the other cheek for this type of shit if it's paying for bigger bills than you had last year.\n\nIf that paycheck pays for another 2500 square feet or just more financial secutity in general, it's hard to turn down. Let alone seek out.\n\nOnce the shit hits the fan, though, those on the ass end of it tend to pull trigger and actually call it out. I think that's what is starting to happen here and I wish it would happen more often. Fuck the toxic shit that happens because money \"allows\" it.\n\nIt has shown to happen quite a bit but just not enough. And the repercussions have shown to be not worth changing over. How that is to change? No idea..but I have a funny feeling that most people with a pulse support a decent swing at it.Yeah, but Bill got to say goodbye on the air. Tucky knew 10 minutes before the press release. Something else is afoot here.Gay for the stay is what they say.Mueller: This does not exonerate the president.\n\nTrump and Barr; Totally exonerated!That\u2019s the one. \n\nAt least we still live in a country where we can openly call people of authority snakes and weasels without concern for our safety. For now.Yeah, the fact that one guy hand selected by the President could just wave it all away at the end really showed how screwed we are. It\u2019s a big club that we ain\u2019t in and then we\u2019ll die one day. Life.The Right: Let's Try out Fascism!\n\nThe Left: Hell no\n\nThe Center: How about we compromise and do some fascism?I fully agree that we must vote them out, and we can. Non-conservatives control the electorate, we just need to *show up.*\n\nStatistically, in 2023 there are a little over 200 million registered US voters. Nearly 39% are Republicans. Over 50% are  Democrat. (Sauce: https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/registered-voters-by-party)\n\nThe one thing that terrifies Republicans (and our foreign enemies) most is, when non-conservatives vote as often as the GOP (every election, every time), they vote fascists out of office. Look at Michigan recently, for instance.\n\nGetting out the vote needs to be job #1. After that, relatively sane mundane politics can return to governing Americans again.\n\nTheir dirty little secret is, conservative foreign enemy assets infiltrated the US by participating more in our democratic system. That's why they spend so much money restricting voters, now that they're in.Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. \"What the devil?\" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. \n\nDraw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, \"Tally ho lads\" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. \n\nFix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion.

No collusion! Witch Hunt!Kitty can have a little fascism, as a treatAs someone who was historically \u201ccenter,\u201d I will say that there are many of us who are petrified at what the right has become & where they are headed. The right have gone so far right however, that the full political spectrum has shifted: What I have always considered to be \u201ccenter\u201d is now essentially considered and viewed to be \u201cleft\u201d on today\u2019s political spectrum - this now makes those that have essentially been slight-right to right be seen as the new \u201ccentrist.\u201dThe Center: We don\u2019t want to admit we also like fascismUnfortunately, the cannons recoil hit you, causing a hairline fracture that will eventually become septic; you die on the Oregon trail.",

This isn\u2019t a Democratic administration, this is a Republican-lite administration. Progressives are the Democrats now.Way back in 1800s when Irish potatoe famine refugees arrived in port of New Orleans, there were conflicts between African American laborers and Irish, fighting for jobs.\n\nIt is economic issue. The community was at best lukewarm on immigration issues.\n\nIt does not help that the fresh immigrants are just as prejudiced toward the community.Simply not acting like him, but still looking like him would also be an improvement.Good riddance from this Latino.I\u2019m not going to come out stumping for Susan Rice, but it is absolutely absurd to compare this administration\u2019s migration and border policies to that of the Trump Admin. \n\nThe Trump Admin policy was \u201cuse Title 42 to keep brown people out of the country.\u201d The Biden Admin policy that \u201cbuilds\u201d on this is \u201cwe have drastically expanded humanitarian parole programs to never before seen levels; would-be migrants should apply through this safe, orderly process and enter the country legally to seek asylum, and those that don\u2019t will be expelled using the active CDC Title 42 authority until it expires on May 11.\u201d It is so plainly superior to the Trump policy that it is basically journalistic malpractice to insinuate otherwise.And she isn't an actual nosferatuSusan Rice is a lifelong Democrat. You may be confusing her with an entirely unrelated Condoleezza Rice.Biden on immigration has been Trump but without the hateful rhetoric.The article quoted staffers by name who all uniformly reported that Susan Rice was the biggest obstacle in the Biden (and Obama) administration to substantive immigration reform.\n\nBut you prefer the press release?And yet, the right continues to attack him on this issue.Uh, no\u2026I said right up top that I wasn\u2019t commenting on Susan Rice specifically. My point was that implying that the Biden Administration *as a whole* is just as bad or even potentially worse than the Trump Administration on immigration is not a claim that deserves to be taken seriously. And that can be supported by statements from individual staffers, press releases, and, most importantly, things that have actually happened.Goes to show that you can never satisfy fascists via triangulation.\u201cNever let a good crisis go to waste.\u201d\n\nEverything is a crisis with the GQP.Well, don\u2019t take it from me.\n\nRead it in the article yourself.\n\nSusan Rice can\u2019t keep Latina staffers on the job she\u2019s so bad. She\u2019s reportedly barely better than Stephen Miller who famously caged children. Susan Rice has  proven herself to be an obstacle through *two* Democratic administrations.\n\nBut, sure, you\u2019ve got a press release that says different so I guess no one will ever know.",

Sending all those jobs to China was a bad idea from day one. We are responsible for making them an economic super power.Wouldn't domestic tech manufacturing of every sort be the best kind of national security? Not to mention the boon to US labor.Fucking duh?Truth.I'll forever be confused as to how this issue is political.If it is national security issues then perhaps critical chips should be produced disregarding any bussiness cases.\n\nThere are small foundry producing components for weapon systems. These foundry are idle in most of time and eamp up production when ther is need. This makes them inefficient but since it is for the national security, defense budgets covers them.\n\nCommercial grade foundaries has to be super efficient, squeezing every time and resources, including the labor.Please Don\u2019t Feed The Dragon.We need to throw as much money into this as possible. $1T wouldn\u2019t be an underestimate of what this may cost.Production still requires critical materials, the rare earth minerals. Most of them are outside our direct control. Many are controlled by China, who stockpiles them.Get all of them though - semi has a long supply chain and you need to win suppliers,  not just Samsung Intel and TSMC.Also, chips are tasty.What was allowing chip production to move offshore for the last 40 years... Profitable for Wallstreet or damaging to America's national security?In retrospect, that might be Nixon's most lasting, impactful mistake.Doesn't Taiwan make most chips? It will certainly help if China is foolish enough to invade the free and independent nation.Well, one political party is threatening to crash the world economy in the name of reducing aid to the poor and seems to be completely against all US interests, both domestically and geopolitically.Semiconductor manufacturing forms the foundation of our modern world. China and Taiwan produce a considerable percent of the worlds chips. Taiwan specifically makes some of the most advanced chips in the world.  Taiwan and China are a result of a civil war that technically hasn't ended. Both claim to own each other.we have spoils from hundreds of years of mining that probably has never been researched. including mountains of coal-ash. \n\nthis wont replace all needs, but it would be a start.I'm pretty old, so I remember Bush and Clinton arguing over whether to give China the Most Favorable Nation status after Tiananmen Square. It seems quaint to think that there was a time we weren't allowed to do business with them because they are a repressive regime, but the thinking was that by opening trade, we'd export our democracy to them. Unfortunately the opposite happened.Is it not funny that two Presidents messed up this country so bad. Nixon sent our factories over to China and Regan gave our money to the rich. And to think people still believe Regan is a hero.It's not that America never learns from the experience of other nations; we just never learn the *good* lessons.In 1992 the USSR had collapsed, and Gorbachev\u2019s policies of opening more trade and relations seem to contribute. (In reality, they were just one factor.) Russia and other former soviet states appeared to be on their way to becoming liberal democracies.\n\nBack then, it looked like exporting democracy worked.\n\nThere\u2019s a much longer tradition to this. Ancient civilizations defeated the barbarians and raiders around them by exporting civilization and its benefits. Draw the Viking raiders in, make alliances with them, play them off against each other, reward them with luxuries. It was a long term strategy but the Romans, Byzantines and Franks and Chinese all used it to great effect.To be fair, we've done business with many repressive regimes, but they have to favor our business interests.Reagan made my dad switch from being a Republican to a Democrat.But I'm talking about this debate. \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/05/17/bush-noncommittal-on-chinas-favored-trade-status/a751f00c-9c5e-4354-8443-bb029d55e871/",

That includes several colleges in Florida such as Reformation Bible college, Pensacola Christian college, Trinity Baptist College, Stetson University, Saint Leo University and Trinity College of Florida.\n\nHuh... thats a list with a very particular bent to it.\n\n>It all began when Jeremy questioned how American education had come to be so utilitarian. He was working as an evening high school English teacher\u2013and realizing transcendent, moral, and ethical ideas had been gutted from the classroom. He came to the conclusion that high-stakes testing was partially to blame.\n\nAnd\n\n>[The SAT exam] has \u201ccensored the entire Christian-Catholic intellectual tradition\u201d and other \u201cthinkers in the history of Western thought\n\nhttps://www.cltexam.com/about/\n\nAh....

I wonder what Ben Sasse is thinking these days about the wisdom of becoming a Florida university president. How long until the only degrees issued in Florida are for Christian-ish Churchiness and Applied Intolerance?It will be interesting to see what his Stepford henchmen come up with.It\u2019s interesting to see how much more he can accelerate while driving over the cliff.Making their degrees worthless is another step on the Republican war on America\u2019s schools.i'm really stunned that university of florida, florida stateU and Umiami are tolerating this idiot's fascists commandments. those schools are going to be as credible as trump university in a minute.This ain\u2019t going anywhere.

You can't develop anything with these few dollars.

Their knowledge didn't change, they just learned how to take the test better.   \n\nAs someone who had kids who were both ends of the spectrum on taking standardized tests (good/bad), I think the SAT/ACT test needs to either go away or stop having an industry around it that gives an obvious edge to the wealthierI give them at least as long as trump university lasted. It'll take a few years for accreditation to be pulled.How long before a degree from a Florida college is worth less than a diploma from a Californian high school?Resumes with any of them all go in the same trash can.this one hurtsAlready there.UF is the #5 Public University in the Country\n\nFSU just had 72k kids apply with an average SAT score of 1370.\n\nFlorida Universities are some of the toughest to get into because they are tuition free to Floridians who get Bright Futures (Over 120k+ qualified last year).  Meaning you are not getting into UF / FSU if you are not a Bright Future recipient any more.Try to get into a UC with only 2 years of science especially for engineering, pre med, nursing, CS or any other science major. The students who care already know the low bar is not enough. Same with math reqs. If someone is considering the cost of out of state tuition anywhere, having to explain this to them maybe means they should do a couple of years at a CC and then consider a transfer later.Florida universities are *tough* for Floridians to get into due to Bright Futures.  Meaning when I sit in my youngest kid's HS graduation next month everyone is going to stay in state who qualifies because it is free tuition.   Our kids are turning down Yale, MIT, Michigan, USC etc to go to UF because they don't pay a dime for tuition.   (They also go in with lots of credits thanks to AP/IB/Dual Enrollment) and the Florida pre-pay is really reasonable)\n\nIt is easier to get in as a non-Floridian because they need some full freight tuitions.

Again - if people actually look at them it is all performative art.   \n\nPeople across the country complain education is too high and student debt.  Yet no one points out the obvious - Florida's education is free to the best & brightest and why they are staying in state and our university rankings are going up.CSU seems more about stats than considering other things.

Who would take that risk?>Must be a small school if they require their professors to be teachers and in administration - per your statements\n\nEvery department at every school has committee members who sit on admissions to their program. \n\n>Cause have been on this rodeo for the last several years with my kids- every school we applied to had a name & face of the administrator who was handling our application and , shocker, non of them were professors.\n\nIn other words you know fuck all about college admissions. You have zero vision of the process going on behind the scenes as someone going through the process. You see what we let you see which is only enough to get from you what we need to make our decisions. Applications go through multiple stages before being rejected or accepted. The intake office (where you turn them in) sorts them and makes sure that the forms are complete and all documents are there. They go through and they rank them using a rubric created by the dean of admissions in consultation with the faculty senate. That weeds out usually 50% of the applications. Then the applications are sent to the individual colleges within the university. If any of those colleges kicks the application back for some reason, then application is rejected. That weeds out another 25%. At that point, the applications are sent to the individual departments for which the student has indicated an interest in joining. If all of those departments kick it back, the student is rejected. \n\nEach institution has its own system, but they are all more or less a riff on the above tune. I worked at two other universities before obtaining tenure at my current institution. They worked basically the same way. \n\n>But sure - please explain how High School seniors are being 'turned away' because of (check notes) administration policies by a governor that have zero effect on current high school seniors.\n\nBecause there is no reason to believe students coming from that state have a reliable education. This governor is only the latest in a line of stupid educational decisions coming out that Florida. Also--because we can. There is no shortage of students, and your children don't matter to anyone except you. If you want your children to have better prospects, either move to a non-shitty state or stop electing anti-education morons. If you're an innocent caught in the middle, you have my condolences.Lol, that's pretty in your face.> they represent a huge risk for an equally huge investment of time and money. Who would take that risk?\n\nMy oldest at UF just got into the best 'grandes \u00e9coles' in Paris - considered one of the best in Euorpe.  All of their classmates have similar stories of med, law schools etc.  Currently, there is no risk.    \n\nAs for money - that's the point.  Tuition is going to be free or greatly reduced with Bright Futures.   Look at any high school graduation in Florida.  You are going to see the vast majority of kids stay in state.   It is why UF, FSU, UCF, USF have been jumping up in the ranking the last decade.> Because there is no reason to believe students coming from that state have a reliable education.  This governor is only the latest in a line of stupid educational decisions coming out that Florida\n\nYup, especially that free education we give kids.  Dual enrollment, getting an AA for free.  Free community college.  Horrible decisions.\n\nHate to even defend Voldermort, but Scott, Crist (who is now a Democrat), and Bush all worked to get Florida education better and improve the test scores.  But sure - tell me more.   \n\nWhat DeSantis is doing is a blimp in the road.   \n\n>  If you want your children to have better prospects, either move to a non-shitty state or stop electing anti-education morons. \n\nMy kid just got into HEC Paris with their shitty UF degree.  So yah.  Totally see how it is effecting them....\n\n>  Also--because we can. There is no shortage of students, and your children don't matter to anyone except you.\n\nSo no school name and no actual explanation of how Florida students, 3rd largest state in the nation, is being summarily 'rejected' for education policies that currently effect **zero** of the students right now applying to college.\n\nSure. \n\nSo glad your phantom school policies didn't affect my youngest who was accepting into , check notes, Purdue & GT for engineering with their 'Florida' diploma.   \n\nwhatever dude.Yeah, it\u2019s one of those \u201cWho had a presidential candidate eating pudding with his fingers on their Bingo card? Nobody?\u201d Moments. We truly are in the weirdest timeline\u2026\n\nBTW, I hope you took my previous comment in the humourous spirit it was intended. In retrospect, it could have been construed as rude.The suggestion wasn\u2019t an immediate impact on higher education but on the future impact.   Why would anyone want to study humanities or science in a state where the government is clearly antagonistic to free thinking, innovation and the arts?\u201d>Yup, especially that free education we give kids. Dual enrollment, getting an AA for free. Free community college. Horrible decisions.\n\nDual enrollment is not a positive educational step. It produces worse students, not better. This is a gimmick that states sell parents that has nothing to do with improving educational outcomes and is really only about saving money by shaving 1-2 years off students' educational track. \n\nAnd an AA isn't a college education. Community college isn't really college. It's remedial labor training with the word \"college\" thrown onto it to make it more palatable. \n\n>My kid just got into HEC Paris with their shitty UF degree. So yah. Totally see how it is effecting them....\n\nHEC Paris is a garbage school. Good for you I guess. Among those with actual educations, HEC Paris is recognized as a dumb person's idea of what a good school looks like. It's a grift, and its students are suckers. Get back to me when they get into a business program at a French poly. \n\n>So no school name and no actual explanation of how Florida students, 3rd largest state in the nation, is being summarily 'rejected' for education policies that currently effect zero of the students right now applying to college.\n\nI'm in an R1 university that is considered one of the best in the world. I'm not naming it because I'm not a moron--I don't want to have to explain to my department chair why something I said on the internet is generating a national news story.\n\n>no actual explanation of how Florida students, 3rd largest state in the nation\n\nI did explain how. We see \"Florida\" and it goes in the trash. It's that simple. We don't care how big the state is--its students are and have been garbage for a very long time. You cannot trust the grades on their transcripts because even morons gets As in Florida because of the consistent degrading of education in that state for the past 30 years. \n\n>So glad your phantom school policies didn't affect my youngest who was accepting into , check notes, Purdue & GT for engineering with their 'Florida' diploma.\n\nGood for you. Your kid got into a mediocre school that accepts 2/3 of everyone who applies there. May they bring you many mediocre tidings and happiness all your life. I don't care.No worries, hard to tell who is genuine and who is just trying to make people jump through hoops.\n\nHonestly upon hindsight his beautiful stubby fingers make great pudding work \ud83d\ude05MoneyThanks, I will no longer be able to see DeSantis without thinking \u201cBeautiful, stubby fingers  coated in pudding\u201d. Blech!Probably wins him votes at this point.",

Jean Carroll&#039;s claims that Donald Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s-and then defamed her when he accused her of lying about the alleged assault for personal gain.\n\n> It&#039;s not clear how the jury will rule, though things were not looking great for Trump even before the trial kicked off.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/12z1836/joe_biden_kicks_off_second_bid_for_office_as/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~682262 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Trump**^#1 **rape**^#2 **Carroll**^#3 **out**^#4 **trial**^#5That headline reads like an onion article.  We truly live in a shit timeline.If this isn't the bottom of the barrel, I'm terrified of what it looks like.Unreal to think rape trial guy has a real shot.Well lets see\u2026. rapist is bad. Not rapist is better.But anyone that suggests a strong primary in either case, better be prepared to duck.Neither of these 2 is what the country needs right now in my opinion. Either one elected will cause further separation. We need a leader that can bring us together as a nation.Nope and Noper.What's the Biden presidency costing me? \n\n\"It's the economy stupid\"  That's what it boils down to next summer.  Inflation and recession?  Biden loses.  \n\nIllegals,  abortion,  Putin's war..? none of that will matter if groceries and gas are cheaper.Both old and crazy.\nBoth accused of sexual assault\nBoth have made racist statements\nBoth abuse their position \n\nExplain to me again the difference?Imagine reading that sentence in 2008Why would anyone accused of rape, guilty or innocent, attempt to run for president without being exonerated first. No American citizen wants a leader with this kind of baggage. Not to mention the other more important issuses that are coming before the courts.Well that keeps both of them in the news lol \ud83d\ude02And yet, Biden is arguably the most accomplished President since Clinton and he has this low approval rating. Whereas trump continues to be a national embarrassment, has a cult following, and will be one of the first defeated presidents to run again in decades. \n\nWe must be living in the upside-down.Welcome to the timeline.I think it's more insane that the guy who called his toddler \"voluptuous\" and bragged about grabbing women by the pussy still isn't in prison for a crime he's admitted to repeatedlyAlso, considering so much of their platform is about \u201cprotecting the children\u201d and going after \u201cgroomers\u201d and \u201cpedophiles\u201d\u2026 only one of the candidates has any sort of connection, let alone a direct one with multiple pictures, to Jeffrey Epstein himself.And like 7 bankruptcies, which somehow gets interpreted as the actions of a fiscally responsible adultYeah that\u2019s bad and all, but what did the article say about hunterbidenslablahblahblah!?#!? /sSounds like the Poster Boy for a GOP nomineeSometimes white bread gets the job done.There's this Democratic campaign advisor who talks about how at their core, conservatives are driven by a fear of chaos. The political reality is that Democrats are far more stable, but allow themselves to be painted as a threat to stability by Republicans. It's a really interesting theory, and it means Trumps support will absolutely wither under an aggressive campaign reminding conservatives of pure chaos that was from 2016-2020.So\u2026 just like last time?I hope it doesn't become a Biden v Trump election again.Slipstreamdrive - I think you will be surprised. I don't see him \"strolling\" into a second term ... the election will be Trump v. Biden, and it will be as close as 2020, and may even tip Trump's way.\n\nI don't see any of the local T supporters walking away from him ... every charge filed, every court date is all a part of a grand conspiracy to keep the working-man down (in their eyes) and Trump is like their Jesus.\n\nConversely: I do hear some D's getting frustrated with Biden, lack of progress, economy in the shit, etc...as someone that laughs every time the old fart tries to form a sentence, i feel he\u2019s the best they\u2019re gonna give us.  the entire game is horribly rigged.We have monumentally dumber shit from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 80s, 90s, 2000s... most of history, honestly.E Jean CarrollWho is also a grandpaYou need to pay just a little attention to understand the difference. Better luck next time.One is a traitor, other is not. That's enough difference for me.One didn\u2019t try and overthrow the capital when they lost a fair election?\n\nOne didn\u2019t start a cult or use that cult to cause violence?\n\nOne isn\u2019t being charged with 30+ felonies?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like Biden but these two are definitely not the same.You\u2019re being lied to and you\u2019re choosing to uncritically accept those lies.Biden tries to be better. \n\nIt\u2019s a fucking low bar, but damn, it\u2019s all Americans have.Both old, yes. Both unfit for office, sure. But otherwise everything else is trump. I\u2019m not excited for Biden, he\u2019s a another spineless Democrat not willing to help the working class, just like the party leaders of the Democratic Party and the DNC. But trump has committed countless crimes, is corrupt, is further corruptible beyond imagination, is backed by a party of fascists, is anti-US, would sell out anyone if it meant a penny of profit for himself and is literally the worst citizen these United States has seen in two centuries. Sure, equate them all you want but there\u2019s no comparison. Maybe demand better from your Democratic Party. Oh, right, that\u2019s too \u2018both sides\u2019 for reddit.Easier to imagine in '88.The portal must be letting in newbies again.If attempting to overthrow the government doesn't send you to prison nothing will.Or isn't on the serial sex offenders list. I mean parents should know.Has a firehose of dark money from organizations named in Orwellian double-speak, who back dishonesty, bigotry, chaos, voter suppression and anything else that pairs with \"rich people don't pay taxes and can't be sued.\"Do you want the vanilla paste, or the spoonful of live scorpions?Makes sense... Republicans are much, much better at weaponizing smaller social issues into a weekly wack-a-mole of outrage.\n\nBut that crap motives people to vote.I sure hope so!it basically already has lolBiden is a near lock for the Democratic candidate . I think the exciting part might be who his VP is, as that could be a way to try and get someone prepared for 2028.I think the \"i just don't like them\" crowd got their rude awakening in 2016.\n\nThat'll be amplified by the fact that there is no left-wing alternative to group behind. Sanders, Warren, and Harris are all backing him. And the GOP will continue to spotlight just how important your vote is with their nonsense.\n\nThe democrat's national campaign plan should be basically \"please proceed.\" The real question is where they go after swing states.Let\u2019s dig into the numbers a bit. 3.5 million people die every year. Trumps base skews much older than Biden\u2019s, and old people die at higher rates than younger people do. 4 million people turn 18 every year. Biden has much higher support from the younger voters. 28 million dead (more conservatives than liberals) since the 2016 election and 32 million new voters. (More liberals than conservatives) Those are massive shifts compared to 2016 when Trump won. Trumps only real chance is the SCOTUS ruling on Moore vs Harper. If states are allowed to throw out votes from the people and instead use the legislature to decide which side gets their electoral votes, he could win. If traditional voting is allowed to continue he doesn\u2019t stand a chance.Do you really think american women have forgotten about the Dobbs ruling and the orange POS that made it possible?I think the really vocal supporters are the hardest to accept change. They\u2019re also the ones that broadcast their allegiance very loudly: the flags, bumper stickers, etc.\n\nThe mass of quieter people are rethinking things and may hopefully prefer an option that offers stability if nothing else.He's a figurehead. I just want him there to not make shit worse.\n\nThis really shouldn't be a shocker to anyone. They've never pushed a another option and it's 2 years too late to get someone up to speed.somewhere in there you are trying to make a pointthey are both the low bar. Dems could made a much better choice. Hopefully the DNC will offer someone isn't and insult to the American public> I\u2019m not excited for Biden, he\u2019s a another spineless Democrat not willing to help the working class...\n\nWell, to start with, this is total excrement. You haven't been paying attention.Still waiting for the Enterprise-C to head back into that little temporal anomaly ...Nothing is certain besides death and taxes.Cake or death?I mean, do I have to eat them? Scorpions are cool petsI thought it was already announced that Harris would be his running mate.Michigan and Pennsylvania have pretty much said they don\u2019t want crazy based on the mid terms. Arizona as well but that is closer. Wisconsin is borderline, but I could see tipping more towards Biden.Now dig into the voter suppression methods.Puppet is what you mean. Don't gloss over it.and we get downvoted for speaking the truth.  \ud83e\udd23An obvious one.Yeah, ok. You\u2019re fooling yourself. And, I\u2019m sorry to be the one to tell you but: you\u2019re not paying attention. Presumptively because you\u2019re too busy fooling yourself.Biden has not followed through with so many of his campaign promised; he promised to pardon/expunge marijuana convictions. He promised to end the death penalty, he promised action to legalize/decriminalize marijuana....except that has not happened.I\u2019ll have the chicken then!\u201cWe\u2019re out of cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo my choices are \u2018or death\u2019?\u201dI had not heard that but it\u2019s possible.Puppet implies more power than I think the position really holds. \n\nI don't think the big money would even bother puppeting a president since they're temporary and the national political circus is an amazing distraction they can use.If you think Biden not keeping his promises on those subjects is bad you should see what trump will do. Having someone do nothing is a huge improvement over a religious extremist maga cult member. Everyone here is kinda confused at your point. Are you suggesting they are both equally bad? Because I promise you one is a dud and the other attempt a coup to overthrow a fair election and declare himself president over democracy. If they look the same to you then idk what to tell ya \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0fyes both are equally bad.  Stockholm syndrome is alive and real in those who want Biden to run again, so for those who want trumpYou must be really young because only young person would compare overthrowing democracy and the 30+ felonies and the violence and the cult and the anti science bill Shit to biden not delivering everything he promised. \n\nAnd if this is Stockholm syndrome then that really downplays everyone whose legitimately had it because no one is excited for Biden or crazy about him. We\u2019re standing by him because the alternative is a maga religious cult. Idk how you can look at that and think biden is just as bad for whatever reason.",

Trump is going to be the nominee regardless so why not make it as costly as possible for all Republicans to get to that point? Then DeSantis can go back to finish up being humiliated by Disney and banning ideas in Florida.[deleted]A few days ago I was seeing this [article](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12tns6l/why_florida_state_republicans_are_getting_peeved/) and others like it floating around.  Now there is this one.  I think it's safe to say that Florida has fucked itself and is loving it.  This state is DeSantis' personal fiefdom for years to come.Florida Republicans try to make DeSantis everyone else's problem.\n\nIn other news:  Florida state Republicans report record level of bruised knees and darkening of nose skin.Fun local fact that you might not be aware of out there in the Other Forty-Nine: The Florida GOP really, really, *really* does not want DeSantis's Lt. Governor to become Governor. No joke, the behind curtains heir apparent is *Casey DeSantis*.>If the amendment passes, it would take effect July 1\n\nI can see it now. Desantis announces before July 1. Lawsuit ensues. Desantis calls special session of the legislature to course correct to make the law retroactive.Rules for thee, not for me.\n\nFuck Ron DeFascist.Dems should filibuster it.Desantis is pretty unlikeable, and very unlikely to be President, so doesn't seem worth going to the bother of changing Florida's RulesFuck this guyoh, to be king\u2026I doubt those folks are going to trade in their Maga hats for a set of off-white waders anytime soon.Wilhoit's Law in action.Special laws for themselves.> Currently, under Florida law, a public official may not run for another office with a term of service that overlaps the official's current position without sending a resignation letter.\n\n> In DeSantis' case, that letter would have to be sent 10 days before Florida's presidential qualification deadline in the beginning of December. \n\n> His resignation would be irrevocable and take effect the day the president-elect is inaugurated in 2025, even if DeSantis were to lose in the primary or general election. \n\nWhy wouldn't it be effective immediately?  Wasn't the point that if you're running for President you're not doing your job as Governor?Wait \u2026 if he runs for President he has to resign? Mickey for Governor \ud83d\ude02It would be way cheaper and way easier for them to make a \u201cPudding fingers Ron can do whatever he wants\u201d law since that\u2019s the general gist of this.And what\u2019s the argument for how this helps people in Florida?Florida republicans announce Ron DeSantis has been breaking campaign finance laws for months, will change the rules after the fact and hope nobody noticesPutin did something similar when his term was about to end.  don't like the law, get your cronies to change the law.Long live corruption in Florida.Florida Republicans no longer hide that they don't care about any of their constituentsThey're also changing the law to shield his travel records from the public record.  So it sounds like this guy's campaign travel is going to be directly funded by Florida taxpayers.In case anyone hadn\u2019t yet noticed, no one in this party gives a single flying fuck about keeping up appearances or rule of law or Constitutionality or any of that mealy-mouthed lip service they claim to support.\n\nIf they have the levers of power, they\u2019ll use them to retain them in perpetuity wherever possible.It does make me wonder what he's got on these state lawmakers. What on earth do they owe him to need to cater to his every whim?I believe Florida has transitioned from being a state to being a covfiefdom.It has more of a \"lick his pudding fingers\" energy to it over tickling his balls.You know what\u2019s funny? Them trying to change this law means they expect him to lose. At the very least they think it\u2019s a strong chanceThis is why they love Russia and try their best to emulate it.If you have the political power, you can do anything you want. Eventually the consequences will catch up, but in the mean time people will dieThe Putin of FloridaBeen saying it for so long. They'll find a way to take out term limits *but just for him.*Wouldn't be shocked at allTrump\u2019s current team is indeed good at fucking with DeSantis, for bette ror worse. He massively outplayed him with the Florida delegation endorsements in Washington and the pudding fingers ad is going viral to a degree uncommon for political attack ads. \n\nThis is hardly an endorsement for Trump, but he is definitely good at playing the primary game.Don\u2019t make me support Trump in something*Mar-a-LardoAnd the fact that this bill didn\u2019t get rushed through immediately tells you all you need to know about DeSantis\u2019 popularity among FL Republican legislators.> -DeSantis Veruca SaltA split between the Trump-is-Jesus crowd and the party of DeathSantis would be a beautiful, beautiful win for Democrats.Weirdly no. It\u2019s a good faith law put in so elected officials would focus on their position instead of using the office as a campaign platform regardless of party. Saner timesThat law\u2019s been around a long time and before 2016 Florida was infamously purple. Full Republican control is a recent thing here.He can\u2019t run for governor in \u201824, he could again in \u201828 though. Can only serve 2 consecutive terms in a 12 year period. FL GOP may like licking his balls enough to change it for him though.It would take all the computing power of CERN to figure out how bad the Lt. Gov must be if they think she's worse than Assistant Piss Boy.They're claiming that the travel records shielding is to protect him and his family. Except that this protects past travels. If DeSantis went on a trip and had been back for a month, how would releasing the records jeopardize his or his family's safety? Unless you invent a time machine, knowing where he was in the past isn't a threat. (Of course, it's not about safety at all, but about hiding corruption from prying eyes.)Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let\u2019s remember two things: first off, none of this has actually passed yet and secondly, Disney is pissed. \n\nHere\u2019s my prediction, Disney breaks out the checkbook and starts funding a few state legislators\u2019 re-election campaigns like nobody\u2019s business. All of a sudden the bill to repeal \u201cresign to run\u201d fails. It\u2019s not going to be a black eye for those who betray DeSantis either. It\u2019s pretty reasonable to tell your constituents, \u201cThe people of Florida are paying for full-time governance and that\u2019s what they should get. Floridians don\u2019t deserve a part-time Governor no matter which party they belong to.\u201d\n\nThis will absolutely fuck DeSantis harder than any dumbass monorail inspection bullshit he is currently trying to pass will affect Disney. They are going to force him into the decision of either running against Trump (who is favored against DeSantis in every poll I have seen), or riding it out until 2026 and face term limits. I have popcorn ready.Trump going unpunished was an advertisement that a fascist takeover will not only be ignored by the people,    lawmakers, and courts, but it will even be cheered on by some, and happily financed by the billionaires. We\u2019re going to see a few people make a play for the lead spot of nationalist/populist leader over the next year. Because that\u2019s just a puppet role in fascism. The face of the truly rich and powerful. State politics are just auditions for the big league, and advertisement to potential financial backers.\n\nMake no mistake, America is trending towards fascism. It started when we allowed the existence of billionaires, and ignored their capturing of our government. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much we can do, by way of law, to stop it at this point. There is a chance that they overplay their hand, but they\u2019re quickly stripping away all the legal protections surrounding democratic elections. So they won\u2019t just go away. They\u2019ll portray the loud minority on the internet as the majority of America, misrepresenting their support through the media they own, and continue stripping the legal system with the power they hold through gerrymandered and rigged elections.This shit is no different than other state legislatures giving their GQP governor immense power, then neutering it as soon as a Democrat wins an election.Cabinet appointments is he's elected. Endorsements for higher offices...Florida Dick-tater. \n\n(Not a typo. Not two typos.)For the Tropico fans out there, he's El Presidente!Don't think of it as supporting Trump, think of it as \"Let them Fight.\"I know, but in all honesty, if Trump wins this bout, it's good for everyone as it gets DeSatan out of office a year earlier than anticipated. \n\nIt is horrible rooting for the bastard to win, but of the two.... ugh. I feel ill.His term is actually up in 2026.No, it's not that. I mean don't get me wrong; she sucks. But it has nothing to do with policy, really. They just don't like her and don't want her to be the first female governor of the state. Casey DeSantis is extremely interested in getting that feather for herself.I think it's a \"Bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for him.\"Three years earlier, if he doesn\u2019t get the Republican nomination he\u2019s governor of Florida until 2026.> Casey DeSantis is extremely interested in getting that feather for herself.\n\nSo, after looking up her qualifications they seem to be limited to \"Conventionally attractive white woman who was on TV\" and \"Let Ron creampie her at least three times based on the number of children they have\".\n\nI miss anything?The article says he would only have to leave in 2025, after the inauguration of the next president. I do think it is weird that he wouldn't have to resign immediately.\n\n\"In DeSantis' case, that letter would have to be sent 10 days before Florida's presidential qualification deadline in the beginning of December.His resignation would be irrevocable and take effect the day the president-elect is inaugurated in 2025, even if DeSantis were to lose in the primary or general election.\"\n\nEDIT: It was this article, apparently.What you\u2019re missing is that she\u2019s 85% of the reason for Ron\u2019s success; she\u2019s a natural politician in the way that a standoffish half-incel like him can never be. She would absolutely be a terrible elected official, but she\u2019s very good at the aspects of politics that are just a nihilistic social game.",

Thats how I have been with my kid since day one. Seems to work quite well! No government required.January 5, 2023 [Looking to watch porn in Louisiana? Expect to hand over your ID](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1146933317/louisiana-new-porn-law-government-id-restriction-privacy)\n\nMarch 23, 2023 [Utah first state to pass social media regulations aimed at protecting minors](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/03/23/breaking-utah-first-state-pass/)\n\nApril 13, 2023 [Arkansas Makes It Illegal For Minors to Be on Social Media Without Parental Consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3wdpv/arkansas-makes-it-illegal-for-minors-to-be-on-social-media-without-parental-consent)\n\nIt's not about protecting kids.Government small enough to fit in your internet connection.What is it really about? They want mom & dad\u2019s ID? Easy to arrest the parents of any teenager talking about abortion? What gives. It\u2019s gotta be something nasty>  social media companies will need to get consent from the parent of a minor through a form, toll-free telephone line, coordinated video conference call, collecting info from government-issued identification \u2014 with the expectation the info will be deleted \u2014 or email.\n\nThe govt ID one would take little effort to fake and the others would take less than that. \n\nAlso, whose ass will be on the line when harm inevitably comes to a kid who faked their consent form? \n\nThis whole idea is unenforceable and any attempt to try to enforce it is just going to throw Texas taxpayers' money down a lawyer shaped drain. \n\nBut hey, it's not like that money would otherwise be spent on schools or anything...I think they really need that form of expression. I did at that age. Hell, I do now. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to keep in contact with anyone sometimes.Every article about every recent bill like this, from several states, is either burying the lede or missing the real story. \n\nIt's not about children, it doesn't only affect or apply to children. You cannot 'enforce' a bill like this without requiring the identification of everyone.Republicans would need democrats consent to do anything!What counts as social media? Will this bill apply to Discord, Reddit, or Tumblr?Of course this would never be used to curtail free speech and access to information down the road ...The party of \u201cSmall Government\u201d strikes again.This is the inevitable result of all the right-wing legislation to ban ideas in schools.  You cannot ban them and then let the internet run wild because kids will just get the information online.  They have to block the internet for it to work.\n\nSo they pass massively intrusive, big government, authoritarian laws that then require further massively intrusive, big government, authoritarian laws.  Next thing you know everything is under their control.New opportunities in porn smuggling!Great make that shit nationwide and no one under 80 allowed. I\u2019m for it.[removed]I'm no fan of Texas or over-legislating, but social media is hazardous for anyone with a mind.And how is social media defined? Obviously, Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook are social media. Is YouTube? Reddit? Discord? If they are playing a game and it has a group chat feature, does that count as social media? What about an old style forum or BBS?\n\nThis is either going to be so broadly written they any discussion online counts as social media or so narrowly written that kids will find methods of communication that don't count.\n\nAnd that's assuming social media sites even follow this law. If they don't have any staff/offices in Texas, they might just ignore it entirely - not really checking for age before people sign up.Are kids really making accounts with their actual birth year? This sounds like if you just tweak the birth year on an account to be 19 or 20 yrs old you won\u2019t be subjected to the parental consent test.  It is a terrible bill - but it is a quiet tool for parents to scream if their children dare to research anything about reproduction or LGBTQ+, etc.     Please Texans call your House person and say NO!Texas Republicans aren't big on teaching or learning unfortunatelyThis has nothing to protecting children as usual. They just don\u2019t the youth accessing any information or messaging the Christian fascist GOP nanny state hasn\u2019t already approved.[deleted]Eventually, they want total control over all public expression, including political speech. How hard would it be to redefine political speech as porn?Not to mention, who is going to prosecute the porn site that doesn't abide by this law? Say the site is based in New York. If it doesn't have any offices/staff in Texas, then how will they be subject to state charges?\n\nAnd if that's not a good enough example, what if the site is based in another country entirely. I doubt other countries will extradite suspects to Texas for state crimes. They have treaties with the United States for extradition, not with individual states.Not expressing support for this particular bill but I disagree.  Kids need to express themselves... in-person, with other kids and adults who they'll see on a recurring basis, seeing the eyes and face of the person they're talking to.  Social media has replaced after-school programs and every other form of youth socialization, and the result has been skyrocketing depression and suicide.Some of these new bills caveat out  certain things.\n\nThis one from Texas seems comprehensive:\n\n> (1)\"Digital service\" means a website, an application,\na program, or software that performs collection or processing\nfunctions with Internet connectivity.  \n(2) \"Digital service provider\" means a person who owns\nor operates a digital service.\n\nAnd the main things caveated?  Small businesses, universities, government sites, some other odd things.\n\nThis bill would seem to cover almost anything and everything that requires or uses an account.  Discord?  Almost certainly.  Reddit?  Not if you just browse without an account... otherwise, yes.  Tumblr?  Ditto.\n\nOtherwise... I dunno.  This bill reads somewhat sane.  There's no obvious anti-woke nonsense here.  If I were an adult in Texas, I might pretend I had a minor child just to be able to take advantage of what appears to be accounts that must legally be free from targeted advertising, etc.\n\nMy concerns have more to do with whether this is at all workable.  I am not sure how any of these sorts of bills intend to enforce any of this with websites from overseas, for example.\n \nThere are other aspects that seem likely to create more problems than they solve.  The bill tries hard to make it easy for parents to do parenting.  The bill seems to mandate an \"easy\" way to make requests for things.  Translated to a typical web app experience the parent must first go through a verification process when signing up but never thereafter when doing things like requesting all the data from the child's account.\n\nYou know what that means?  When the **parent** gets hacked because the **parent** is doing stupid stuff on the web and someone gets their web account passwords, the hacker can hijack this parental role and demand all the stuff from the kids account.  This just *creates* an avenue to attack kids rather than prevents it.Under 25 nothing is permanently retained and over 50 everything is fact checked.Then parents need to be fucking parents and say no. This isn't a job for govt it's a job for parents.Yup. They\u2019re telegraphing it all over the place. I mean, they\u2019ve flat out said (yesterday?) they need to keep younger folks from voting. That\u2019s the whole reason behind all of these book bans and crackdowns on critical thinking. They want kids having sex, not knowing what their periods are - with the inability to get abortions. Pregnant, low wage and dumb little subservient choir folk is their goal.Huge different between flashing your ID to a clerk for some printed materials for hometime single-player hankypanky and giving a shady website your personal data. It can easily be a way for the government to track what websites you're going to and with their laser focus on the LGBT community, that opens the door for flat-out banning non-hetero pornography.Ok that sounds in the neighborhood. Probably the existence of anything LGBT on social media = grooming and / or sexual content or whatever.I was worried about the call coming inside the house; ie, LGBTQ+ kid living in household that doesn't accept them, but you are completely right about the security implications.\n\nConsidering how easy it is to trick the overworked Verizon technician in handing order SIM cards...   if there's a backdoor then this is probably going to be a security nightmare too.I agree.\n\nDo kids listen to their parents though? And do the parents have enough information to be honest with their children why they shouldn't do that?\n\nBecause the information *is* out there, but how many parents actually seek it out? Especially when they themselves are addicted to the very same social media?They are not just interested in the porn, they 100% plan to block access to anything they don't approve of so they can try to keep queer kids ignorant, afraid, and closeted for as long as possible.Still the responsibility of the parents. It's not the govts job to make your kid listen to you. It's not the govts job to force that information into the parents head. It's the parents job to be the best parent they can be to their child.Well said, friend! Another way to control information. Is this the same bill that wants to make VPNs a felony?Posted above:\n\nYup. They\u2019re telegraphing it all over the place. I mean, they\u2019ve flat out said (yesterday?) they need to keep younger folks from voting. That\u2019s the whole reason behind all of these book bans and crackdowns on critical thinking. They want kids having sex, not knowing what their periods are - with the inability to get abortions. Pregnant, low wage and dumb little subservient choir folk is their goal.I agree.\n\nSo how do we ensure the parents have the requisite knowledge to protect their kids? And if we cannot ensure that? Then what? Do we shrug our shoulders and move on, or do we look for another solution?\n\nBecause you are right the problem goes away when parents do their job right.  But they dont, at least not in large enough numbers.I don't think so, I thought that was the federal-level RESTRICT bill and only, in theory, if that VPN is used to circumvent an app ban.\n\nIt's all bullshit, of course, there are zero good intentions in any of this.Literally not my problem nor the govts. Idk what is so hard about understanding the concept of parents being parents. Listen I have a kid, we do tons of research on our own to raise our child. If you don't care about your kid enough to parent them nothing the govt can do will work anyway.Sure it can. The government could make a law saying social media companies are not allowed to sell or store the data of minors. Nips it in the bud right there. No laws on parents required.\n\nWhy would something have to be \"your problem\" to care about it? If your neighbor's dog has cancer its not your problem, but its still sad that a beloved pet is dying and a family is suffering isn't it? Even if you hate your neighbor's guts, you wouldn't take joy in their suffering, would you?\n\nI'm not affected by the anti-LGBT laws lawmakers are pushing, by definition that is not my problem as a straight male. And yet I still care that those people are suffering unjustly. I still push for laws protecting their rights.\n\nSo why is it that you think we shouldn't care if it doesnt affect us?",

A judge should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.  \n>  \n>(B) Outside Influence. A judge should not allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment. A judge should neither lend the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others nor convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge. A judge should not testify voluntarily as a character witness.  \n>  \n>(C) Nondiscriminatory Membership. A judge should not hold membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin.He's probably just really busy still looking for who leaked the Dobbs decision. Right....?What is the check on the Supreme Court if Congress has no oversight role?The reply is bizarre, because it's rare for a justice to testify he refuses?\n\nSo brazen.Offer him a vacation on a jet and a luxurious yacht.I can understand why.

SimpleSeems like with someone who can impact our entire nation so much, it should be a case of testify or resign.Not sure what he could say. It\u2019s obvious that at least the Republican justices have no ethics, and I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with suitable distractions to take the heat off. Plus he might end up saying even more quiet parts outloud.Certainly his logic is somewhere along the line of 'We have separation of powers between the branches of government, so you can't have a member of the Justice branch testify in front of the Legislative branch'.  \n\nIf you accept and follow that logic, then the courts should be in judgement over the laws passed by the Legislative branch, or any action taken by the Executive branch. Yes they could try someone who breaks the law, but not make a judgement on the validity of the law or executive decision.roberts court has been a complete disgrace from gutting voting rights act to ending roe v wadeChecks and balances. If he\u2019s not going to abide by checks and balances, impeach him and remove him from the bench.I\u2019m going to start declining shit. Court summons? Decline. Jury duty?

When the Senate sends someone a letter saying \"Would you care to voluntarily show up and talk to us?\" there's literally no obligation to go, the person can just say \"No thanks\" and that's it. If the Senate actually wants to FORCE Roberts to show up they need to subpoena him, and if he ignored a subpoena then it's a whole other ballgame.\n\nAnd no, I'm not saying Roberts refusing to deal with the scandal around Thomas is a good idea. He's definitely putting a bad foot forward ignoring it. I'm just saying that this notion Roberts was somehow legally or Constitutionally required to show up in this case is wrong but keeps showing up in the comments.He made a fool of the dems.  They don't do oversight, they do polite requests.\n\nThey won't do shit.  All their talk about ethics laws for the USSC is trash.  Unless any possible ethics laws comes with criminal penalties, the Supreme court will straight ignore them.\n\nRest assured, if they start to serioudly discuss rules for the court, some moderate dem who will come out against ethics laws for the justices, and then we'll never hear about it again.[deleted]Do we not have public corruption laws? You give Roberts a choice: come in and answer some questions voluntarily or get yourself a good criminal defense attorney.Surprising nobodyHow unethical of him. Rofl.Why should he testify about something he obviously knows nothing about?Senate:  \"Well, we've tried everything, there's nothing more we can do.\"Why the fuck are they inviting him?  Subpoena his ass.  I don't care if he's the chief justice.Of course he does.  The Supreme Court is entirely corrupt and he doesn't want any more of their dirty laundry out there.  Like we hear everyday from police \"we have investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing\".Pitchforks and torches!!!He has no ethics to talk about.\u201cAccountability, nah\u201dHow ethical.\u201cNah fam, I\u2019m good..\u201dThat photo is the definition of \u2018smug.\u2019He gets an invitation. I\u2019d get a subpoena and arrested if I didn\u2019t show.\"I'm good, thanks.\" - CJJRSubpoena his ass and let's get this over with. If he refuses, the system of checks & balances is completely broken and we're into Constitutional Crisis territory (if we're not already there). If he shows up, we can put the Court's corruption on full display and demand accountability. The GOP will of course provide cover for their lapdogs, but at least the truth will be fully exposed. Hopefully those on the fence or with their heads buried will acknowledge how bad it is and actually start helping to vote this corrupt SOB's out.Of course he does. Every Republican called up by a court for any reason has just been saying \"Fuck you\" to the court systems and their procedures. I for one am sick to death of them getting away with all of the crimes they have been getting away with since Bumblefuck took office. Someone needs to make these assholes pay and the Supreme Court is one of the most corrupt institutions in the US right now - reform is needed urgently.You can't testify about something that doesn't exist. Can you?D Senator: \"Chief Justice Roberts, do you have any financial stake in any of the cases that have been brought before you on the Supreme Court?\"\n\nRoberts: \"I plead the fifth\" as he gets up and walks out.What a weak leader\u201cAccountability is for the peasants, we owe you no explanations\u201d\"Accountibility for thee, not for me\" - The Supreme CourtI prefer not to.How can Chief Justice Robert speak on ethics if he has none?Then I might admit to the same crimesRoberts is a feckless turd.So pleading the fif?Reason; He dont want to be in the hot seat where the evidence is so strong against his judicial peers, who know they should resign,and so does he.Oh well La de da. Bully for him.Of course he does. He may not like to admit it, or even think about it, but he is complicit in every single fucked up thing this Court has done.\n\nGiving testimony in front of the Senate would likely force him to confront that fact.Probably because of something, something, Leonard Leo.I guess without Feinstein they don\u2019t have the votes to subpoena him and Thomas. But that\u2019s okay, what with the Gorsuch real estate deal coming to light they should subpoena all six conservatives and their financials.A lifetime appointment to the highest seat in the land and he think's he's above being asked any questions. And, truthfully, he is.... because the Republicans will never lift a finger to hold one of \"their\" judges accountable.Why would he go? Like who\u2019s gonna make him?\n\nI\u2019m asking seriously, who has to power to compel him to testify?You bet your ass if Robert\u2019s was found to have done all the things that Thomas had done that was uncovered in recent weeks, republicans would be after his head.Grab \u2018em by the \u2026 Roberts??Guess that\u2019s what subpoenas are for\u2026Just tell them you like beer\u20269 wizards in black robesHe's probably just holding out for more money.Send the subpoena.Needs Feinstein return to Judiciary Committee.We should also ignore SCOTUS\u2019s invitation to follow its rulings.Means \"No.\"Is it wrong that I said that in a southern sheriff\u2019s voice??\"There are a lot of long words in there, Senate, we're naught but humble Justices.\"Correct.  He is aiding and abetting criminal corruption.An illegitimate court.This hasn't been a secretGuarantee he\u2019s the dirtiest one of all.I\u2019ve disliked him since he gutted voting rights.His wife is making bank off of itThey are all fucking corrupt, don\u2019t kid yourself.Wait what are you saying? Are you implying Justice Roberts might be a right-leaning conservative judge with an AGENDA? If that were the case, wouldn't someone be doing something about it?This is the Trump defense.  Look at all of these unprecedented investigations!\n\nIt's unprecedented because your behavior and your court's illegitimacy is unprecedented.Recent history shows the Roberts court usually has no interest in precedent; destroying decades of precedent to inflict their U.S. taliban theocratic visions against America.Not a constitutional scholar, but I am a lawyer. \n\nRoberts isn\u2019t out of line for declining and this is essentially the expected response the vast majority of justices throughout US history would have given. \n\nThe problem is that it\u2019s internally coherent and no one put guardrails for this sort of thing into the original organization of our government. \n\n-\tWe never planned for how powerful corporations and individual wealth could become. \n-\tWe never planned for the inevitability that Congress would abdicate the majority of its power to the executive. \n-\tWe never planned for the idea that the executive order would become the main way that law gets made. \n-\tWe never planned for how important supreme court justices would become\u2014so important that the number of Supreme Court justices that are confirmed defines the success of whole presidencies. \n-\tAnd most importantly, we never planned a way to patch fixes for these types of structural problems in a reasonably attainable manner.\n\nMy point is that while this may be disappointing behavior from Roberts, it\u2019s really not Roberts\u2019 fault at all of this is so corrupt and broken, and a fix would require much more than him going over to have a chat with congress. Also, he\u2019s respecting the norms that are a result of the broken system we do have.>as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns\n\nBut on the other hand Checks and Balances. Fuck you Roberts.>...and noted a sitting chief justice has testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on only two occasions in the past 102 years.\n\nAnd how often has a sitting chief justice *been asked* to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the past 102 years?Shows the court isn't as well-versed in constitutional law as they should be. They don't even know who pays to keep their lights on and (legit) pays their bills.Get a liberal Justice to do it. A moderate like Kagan who\u2019s prob familiar with the shenanigans of politics from working in the Clinton and Obama administrations. David Souter testified before Congress on numerous occasions. Why not KaganI had the same thought.  People are sniffing around Gorsuch now - what more are they going to find?What do you mean \"mismanagement\"? He's a Republican, he's managing his court exactly how a Republican would. Surprised he hasn't told us it's all trans kids fault yet.This is the real danger. There are plenty of corrupt legislators, even to the point of holding critical action hostage for years. But the court is on the precipice of becoming completely illegitimate as a body. There's no real coming back from that. There's no remedy when the legislature decides to enable the complete corruption of the judiciary.The corruption should be brought up at every opportunity in every case brought before the court.Sadly without Feinstein the committee doesn\u2019t have the votes to subpoena himIt wasn\u2019t a subpoena. Every person can decline an invitation, if he ignores a subpoena then he should be impeached.For what? There was not subpoena?\n\nHe was asked it come, he said no.\n\nIf you want to demand him to come, the senate can do that. Let\u2019s see if they do\n\nFacts are importantThey didn't subpoena him, they just invited him to voluntarily appear so he's totally within his rights to say No. If they want to force him to come they need to subpoena him.They can\u2019t because Feinstein is needed to have the vote to issue the subpoena. Senate Judiciary committee is neutered at the moment.Ouch! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude4cThey didn't subpoena him, they just asked if he'd care to voluntarily appear. He's totally allowed to say No to that. They need to subpoena him if they want to force him to show up.Yes.  But they don\u2019t have the votes in the House for impeachment.\n\nThey don\u2019t even have the votes to do anything on the Judiciary Committee.  Because Feinstein refuses to show up or retire.They didn't subpoena him, they just asked him if he'd are to voluntarily show up, so he's totally within his rights not to say No. They need to subpoena him if they want to actually force him to appear. He's not going to get impeached for refusing a voluntary invitation.Would you like to bet a dollar on that?A fair, and still open question.  Lots of people own congresscritters, but to own a SCOTUS ?  That's a higher level game.Because the Judiciary is a separate branch of government, it's likely a subpoena would be ignored, anyway. \n\nAnd who would make the final determination on the legality? \n\nRoberts and company. \n\nRoberts shows up voluntarily, or he doesn't show up at all.Well stated fact. Such a breath of fresh air hereCan you explain what the Democrats are supposed to do? I would love to hear from an expert on a solution to this issue.They didn't subpoena him, they just voluntarily asked him to appear, so he's totally within his rights to say No Thanks. If the Senate wants to force someone to appear they need to subpoena them.And what would the charge be against Robert that they could indict him on?Does he have any gambling debts or a mom that would like a bigger bedroom?This. Congressional subpoena followed by DOJ prosecution if he refuses to comply. If the Supreme Court overturns a subpoena against its own Chief Justice, it would eliminate what little credibility they have left.\n\nAt this point, Democrats should plan on running on Supreme Court reform in 2024. Keep building the case.Doesnt that come from the judiciary committee that is logged down from a certain nonagenarian.What a shitshow.Or for republicans to stop blocking a temp replacement.Yes, because what we need is a 90-year-old that can barely stay awake and often can\u2019t make it to important votes due to health reasons to take on a major new investigation and lead the charge here. This is why Democrats lose despite being more popular.Dont worry shes a lib girl boss just like RBG and Pelosi.  We will be fine.No it doesn't, this Senate as a whole can send a subpoena, or any subcommittee, it doesn't have to be the judiciary.Why wont that hag just fucking quit already. For fucks sake, she cant find her ass with 2 hands.thank goodness that's no problem, according to her staff she's fit as a fiddle and will be back to work any minute now.Yes. Need to say it with a fake pirate accent lol.\n\nAlso I think \"acquiesce\" may be outside the traditional vocabulary of a good old boy sheriff.Nah, you good. The south sucks.It\u2019s a line from captain barbosa in Pirate of the CaribbeanHis appointment to the Supreme Court itself fits that category.It\u2019s really kind of a smoking gun.Yeah, he's the one who leaked Roe the second it was enough votes to lock the others into their votes when it's likely they didn't intend to vote that way in the end.Right. He likes to play the good cop in their game of good cop/bad cop.SCOTUS is self-policing. Except for the fact that it doesn't police itself.At least our knowledge of it is unprecedentedInteresting point and well stated.  The current SCOTUS has no interest in precedent to achieve its goals, but is happy to fall back on it to hide their corruption.You had the King of England as a sovereign, now the SC.He's ironically set a precedent that precedents don't matter.Well put, thanks. That also brings me to the issue that some people in an unhealthy manner treat or regard the US constitution with all of its amendments as some piece of divine gospel, rather than a product of people from a certain era who could foresee a lot but not everything (although some things they foresaw and worried about did happen..)Potential guardrails, aside from the obvious impeachment or Court packing:\n\n1) strip appellate authority from SCOTUS, form a new article 3 appellate court;\n\n2) strip the budget from SCOTUS, along with compensation for future justices;\n\n3) direct the DOJ and other executive agencies to refuse to enforce rulings;\n\n4) legislatively define \u201cgood behavior\u201d to exclude convictions for state or federal crimes, and boom, no impeachment necessary for several of them.\n\nThere are many potential options, they just require creative lawyering. They may cause a constitutional crisis, but it could be argued were already in one.I\u2019m assuming he has no right to decline a subpoena though.I'd rather hear about options that can be done than hear other people say what can't be done, or what doesn't work, and since you haven't offered those negatives up, I would like to know your thoughts on what we, or anybody else, can do about this.Well said\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault he perpetrates a broken system\u201d is an argument I stop buying when you get around the level of Chief Justice, tbh. He didn\u2019t craft it, sure. But he is in charge of it now. He is responsible for it now. Roberts voter for opening the floodgates on corruption with his concurrence on Citizens United.Congress does have authority to regulate the court though. They also have impeachment and removal powers. Could justices be compelled to appear before Congress during an impeachment investigation for another justice?I think the SCOTUS budget isnt discretionary. I dont think Congress has the power to cut it. Will have to look into that.\n\nEdit: Looks like there is some discretionary spending that Congress has to approve, but Justices' salaries are protected by the ConstitutionI think what we will find is they have been doing this for more than a decade without fear of any control over their actions.Schumer claims it needs 60 votes to replace her on the committee\u2026 do you think McConnell wouldn\u2019t modify the procedures to require only 51 if the situation weren\u2019t reversed?Even if congress issued a subpoena, they're routinely ignored anyway. I'd love to see how it would go down if they did actually try.He was asked to come by the body that governs the courts. His refusal to accept a polite invitation is a frivolous dare to escalate. He\u2019s an ass.I disagree that Roberts would refuse to appear if legally subpoenaed. But it's a moot point because they didn't subpoena him in the first place.That is my question. Is public corruption not illegal in the US? Obviously you have people at all levels of government that are on the take. Surely there is some kind of law, but then assuming the US is like the rest of the world usually is a mistake.Or an uncontrollable urge to spend a few weeks cruising around a volcanic Indonesian archipelago on a 160-foot yacht?\u201cYou an oak guy, Johnny? I like oak, myself\u2026\u201dSome people make it sound like someone just build CT\u2019s a museum and his mother is a team player for being inconvenienced that her old home had to be upgraded while she\u2019s living out her life there. SMDHTwo years ago I would have said this is too much, but not anymore. I suspect I\u2019m not alone.I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a lawyer'Murica!That's not gonna happen.Yes, let's keep wishing upon a star for Republicans to allow a temp replacement! And also, maybe they'll investigate Clarence Thomas, and look into the January 6th attack!Lol!!! I lived in GA and VA and definitely!! ;)I believe you misspelled \u201csmocking\u201dThat was Alito.\n\nRoberts was working on pulling in Kavanaugh for a more narrow ruling.I don't think the leak changed the outcome.  If they intended to vote to uphold it, they would have.I will admit I am a little fuzzy, but I thought the end of the days of John Marshall's term they did strike a law down as unconstitutional and the then president (I want to say Andrew Jackson  basically told them \"Go ahead and try to enforce that ruling\" and they could not so option 3 is not so far fetched.Those aren\u2019t constitutional guard rails lol. Those are blowing up US principles to install the people you wantHe can and likely would refuse a subpoena. Congress has the ability to enforce their subpoena power\u2014in theory\u2014but they haven\u2019t used it in ages, and to my memory, never against a justice.The source of our problems and the potential solution to the problems is Congress. We have to force Congress back into governance. \n\n-\tRevisit Citizens United and fix campaign finance laws so that all money that goes into political campaigns is transparent and capped at low amounts\n-\tAll politicians must put their assets into a blind trust for the duration of their service to the public and stock trading is prohibited\n-\tFix gerrymandered districts using a transparent algorithm to universally redistrict the country following the same pattern\n-\tRequire that Congress work five day weeks and for more weeks of the year\n-\tEnact term limits: 3-4 terms and you\u2019re out\n-\tEnact strict voting requirements: miss a certain number of votes and you are expelled\n-\tProhibit media companies from calling themselves news or implying they are news if they argue in court that they are merely entertainment \n\nThere are plenty of other ideas for how to fix Congress, and I\u2019m into those ideas as well, but this would be a great start.Yes and yes, but I would make the important distinction between theoretical and practical powers. Congress, as it is currently, is too inept to impeach a justice from either side short of something so egregiously bad that it got bipartisan, universal support. And in that circumstance, the justice would resign before being impeached.\n\nCongress *can* theoretically fix all of the problems I identified above in one legislative session. But I\u2019m practice, they can\u2019t and won\u2019t because the legislature is so inept and corrupt.The salaries of the current justices can't be changed. But anyone else who gets appointed in the future could be given $1 per year, and the budget for staffing could probably be cut to the point that the justices have to take turns cleaning the toilets.\n\nBizarrely enough, it's easier to get the votes to completely ruin the Supreme Court itself than it is to impeach and remove one corrupt justice.Agree\u2026..that would be ugly to watchThat could be true but why would that cause him to be imprisoned.\n\nWhat is the crime here?I think Roberts understands there's no upside to appearing. \n\nIt shows the subservience of the Judiciary to Congress. \n\nIt allows partisan attacks on the Judiciary (as that is the general reason to even have congressional hearings). \n\nIt adds to the furor of Thomas (and now Gorsuch) ignoring ethics concerns.\n\nIt increases the risk of Congress trying to regulate the Judiciary, especially if Roberts doesn't knock it out of the park.\n\nAnd,in general, Congress does not lead with a subpoena.How is not coming coming to a voluntary request(not a subpoena) public corruption?With hookers and blow of courseYeah, I didn't realize how bad it was but the events really since 2016 have made it clear one group is trying to legislate from the bench without ethics oversight. It is embarrassing.Lol I forgot about smockingIt was ailito. It was.They're definitely constitutional guardrails. Those are actions Congress has authority to perform that would act as checks on the Supreme Court.\n\nCongress has legislative authority to regulate the court and change the scope of its jurisdiction. They have tools beyond impeachment. If using their tools equates to \"blowing up US principles\" then we're deciding to hamstring congress and ignore the constitution out of some twisted sense of tradition.That seems like it would lead to a constitutional crisis on a level we haven\u2019t seen since Bush v Gore.Which, again, is one of those guardrails\u2026 our politicians lack the insight and political will to use them.Supreme Court justices don\u2019t need a blind trust. They have a job for life. They need to be banned from owning anything and be given a parsonage of government housingI disagree with term limits but that\u2019s about it. I think the kids a certain number of votes and you\u2019re out is good enough.Oh I dunno, I kinda had a vague feeling that the court is corrupt AF and Roberts is ultimately responsible. But maybe the feeling will pass without any action.I never said Congress leads with a subpoena, I said if they want to force him to appear that\u2019s what they need to do. And courts have long upheld that Congress has fairly broad power to subpoena people when considering legislation, and in this case the Senate has a strong argument for considering legislation regarding federal ethics including judicial ethics. Roberts if subpoenaed is free to argue his reasons why Congress should try and micromanage judicial ethics, but he\u2019ll still be compelled to show up.If he has a doctor's note or something saying he can't make it then OK, otherwise: GUILTY.I think there is a heavy implication, given the size of the yacht, and it should be complimentary. \n\nIf you invite me to your enormous yacht and there isn\u2019t hookers and blow\u2026I\u2019m definitely going to be silently disappointed.How is it different from the Supreme Court justices using their tools in ways we are terming illegitimate and inappropriateYou mean the one Roberts worked on, and was rewarded with the Chief Justice role for? That constitutional crisis?\n\nOr the recent attempted coup? Is that one on the radar?I\u2019m talking about people in Congress, but speaking the Supreme Court, those should also have term limits and blind trusts.I understand the precedent. \n\nBut do you understand who will make the final determination as to whether SCOTUS justices are required to appear before Congress because of allegations of corruption? \n\nThe SCOTUS justices who have been accused of corruption.\n\nSomehow, I expect their corruption (and fear of being exposed) to be strong enough to overturn their judicial ethics. It's pretty much the entire reason why they're under investigation for breached of judicial ethics in the first place.Because that\u2019s how federal indictments work\u2026lol\n\n\nHave a good dayWell, for one, it\u2019s a response to the justices using their tools in a way we term illegitimate and inappropriate, namely reversing 50 years of precedent (more, really, since Alito arguably threw out the entire substantive due process doctrine) to remove a right.\n\nIf your argument is that congress can never use its checks on SCOTUS, regardless of how they act, because that\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d, then see the comment two above.Yes. \n\nBecause the coup was an utter failure, I don\u2019t think it rises to Bush v Gore. I guess if we take the whole Trump presidency as one continuous crisis that would get it there.My preferred solution is not term limits which are problematic in ways but that every federal politician, judge, agency head and cabinet official is subject to a regular national approval vote (of the voters) where a simple majority (maybe like 60%) can remove any office holder and force a new selection/election. And yes it should be a national vote. (I\u2019d accept congresspeople only being subject to their states or perhaps districts). And that vote should occur on a regular basis.\n\nIt\u2019s exceptionally nuts that the most powerful member of the legislature only is accountable to the same Kentucky voters that keep voting for him. To say nothing of Kevin McCarthyNo one's talking about federal indictments (yet), but imagine if Hillary told Trey Gowdy and his eight select committees to piss off when asked to answer questions about Benghazi? It's Congress's job to exercise oversight over the judiciary. In no other job could you get away with telling your boss when asked to come in to discuss some issues pertaining to your employment that you don't feel like it. Roberts is corrupt. Thomas is tremendously corrupt. And now apparently Gorsuch is too. These aren't dumb people, so for example, forgetting to disclose million dollar land deals while meticulously accounting for everything else right down to a pair of boots someone once gave you as a gift looks shady AF. You do things like this when you want to break the law and hide it to avoid detection and prosecution.It would massively cut down on grandstanding for the base and encourage actually getting work done.What would you indictment him for in this case?\n\nIf you want to compel him to come in, issue a subpoena\u2026easy peasy.No idea which is why I started off asking if there are public corruption laws. Maybe there's not. I am not an expert on U.S. Code. Clearly these guys are corrupt, and the fact that they refuse to answer what would likely be a bunch of softball questions from people who are equally, if not more, corrupt than they are says it all.That\u2019s fair",

Has nothing to do with the fact corporations and wealthy barely paying any taxes.\n\n/sNothing arouses a Republican like a starving child.That's what they want to do!Ah yes sounds like pro life to me.The thought of starving kids excites Republican voters.[the cruelty is the point\u00b9](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/) \n\n[the cruelty is the point\u00b2](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-s-homelessness-plan-typical-cruel-gop-policy-n1297605)When people start to starve there's always the option of eating the people responsible.I swear Republicans are getting more and more like Hard Target hunting poor people for sport... They want poor people to not be able to get food aid, want to take away their reproductive rights so they stay poor, and want to make sure they all have guns for when life gets really rough....\n\n\nHow can anyone say they are the party of the middle class?On brand for themRepublicans: Let\u2019s limit the rights and benefits for absolutely everyone\nRepublicans in 2024: The election is riggedFeed them once a day or very little just like military dogs. Pathetic \ud83d\ude21Kicking people who are already down is the eternal Republican pastime and agenda.So on top of abolishing democracy in Montana (because people didn't vote for who the republicans ordered , and their tinpot far right dictatorship can't handle it so they officially abolished the election and stormed the montana capitol with their hitmen disguised as riot cops), the insur(R)ectionist party hope for working class (that is anyone dependant on a wage) america to go hungry.How many of them are their voters?I have my doubts taxing the rich their fair share will improve our safety nets. Republicans hate safety nets. They will 100% find something else to spend increased tax money that does not help those who need help.Unless we stop letting misinformation get in the way, and start telling truths. It shouldn\u2019t matter if the republicans blame the dems because the proof is literally there. The Maga base is denser than cement so they are gonna listen to what they wanna hear anyway. \n\nWe need to fight the republicans no matter what, including the next and future elections on all levels.I believe Republicans spend a lot of time thinking of starving children. It arouses them.>  helps keep crime levels down\n\nYep, and abortion access does too. So much for Republicans wanting to stop crime.If crime levels were low why would anyone feel the need to buy guns? \ud83e\udd14can we stop calling them christians and start calling them CINOs Christian in name only. These people are all going to hell if you actually believe that crap.>Then they go and do something to solve the problem.\n\nWhen do they ever actually solve the problem?The Treason Party has solved nothing, ever.Source on abolishing Montana?I like that.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*I don\u2019t have a problem with this. No one I know who hunts uses a rifle like this for hunting. There is no slippery slope, just nuts who want access to this type of gun, regardless of the consequences of unlimited access to anyone. Washington is a great place to live, if you don\u2019t like it, Idaho is within spitting distance. Good luck having the same freedoms as Washington though in a theological government for anyone who isn\u2019t white and evangelical.Good. Every state should follow.I\u2019m so glad. I\u2019m a gun owner that fully supports gun safety laws. And I oppose battlefield weapons.  Im surprised the NRA doesn\u2019t support rocket launchers; the comfy shoulder mounted ones for home use.Finally, some real progress.Shame. Nothing but negatives.  Hoping for an overturn for all the legal gun owners dealing with this absurdity.[deleted]To those of you that think the opposing view is dead, let me offer my opinion. Silence is not always submission. You have no clue as to why so many are silent. I would advise you to stop forcing a minority view while hiding behind a VPN. If this leads to abuse by state or government in the future, your comments will be remembered. We are not conspiracy theorists or white extremists; we are everyone, of every group. You will see this in less than one month, unless lawyers do their jobs in WA via challenging this. Paid Nazis and Communists are on notice - including moderators, clowns clapping behind Inslee, and Reddit CEO. DO NOT DELETE THIS. TRUST ME. I am not typing this from the basement of a conservative home. I am more liberal than you.Great. Even more limitations on my rights while these asshats have armed security details with the same weapons I\u2019m being judged for owning. The government and its police force have proven time and time again, they are incapable of protecting the public, and the supreme has said multiple times the police has no obligation to protect the public. Therefore the government should\nHave zero say in what manner and with what tools I protect me and my family with.If you could only afford one rifle for all-around use, meaning target, home defense, varmint control and small game, you would choose an AR platform weapon. There are around 25 million of them in private hands, purchased by people who actually know what they are talking about. It is the top-selling home defense weapon in America by a wide margin.\n\nThis silly myth that the only reason to acquire an AR is to commit mass slaughter is designed to appeal to people who get most of their information from Facebook memes, and it does. I think public policy should be made by reasonable people with a grasp of the facts.Don\u2019t give them any ideas.They\u2019ve *all* been battlefield weaponsCompletely agree. Now should someone with the proper training and registration be able to get one, sure. But we've proven we can't be trusted with nice things.  The NRA used to do good, now they are some of the worst lobbyists and extremists out there.How?Yea, such a shame that military grade weapons of mass murder won't be as easy to get for gun fetishists..except by what I am reading in bill 1240-S the AR15, AK47, and many others are explicitly banned.\n\n\nhttps://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Passed%20Legislature/1240-S.PL.pdf?q=20230425143018The more restrictive the gun control bill, the more it will be challenged and overturned in the SCOTUS.  Any law has to be within the rights of the 2nd Amend.They banned a whole list of \"assault weapons\" including the Barrett M87, which doesn't even exist. They probably meant the Barrett M82, which is an anti material rifle. It's odd though, because they included the M107, which is the same thing as the M82.\n\nBut they also missed the Ruger Mini14, the MCX platform (which the military is replacing M16s and M4s with, SOCOM already has).Some are for mass kills.Military grade = a .22 ruger charger and pistols with threaded barrels. Also, apparently military grade is for local law enforcement only. I own guns, vote left, and approve of gun reform laws but this one ain\u2019t it.Military grade = lowest bidder lol.Read up on this bill then comment.  Plenty of liberal Washingtonians aren\u2019t happy about this.[deleted]Well David Chipman said in sworn testimony before Congress that they sell Barret machine guns out of the trunks of cars at 7-11 so who is going to sweat the silly details, eh?\n\nEdit: spell check thought somebody named Chapman said that.Couldn't give 2 fucks. Enough is enough.Not just 'most'. \n\nAbout 3% of homicides are committed with any kind of rifle.\n\nBut yeah, you did move the goalposts there.Except that is not what you said.  You said \"a bogus bill about barrel length and threads\".  Also just by flat deaths yes, but there is a reason the AR15 has been used in so many mass shootings.  Now should any guns be flat out banned...no.  There should be a path to legally own any gun with proper training and registration.  We have unfortunately been shown we as a people can't be trusted to we need to have our toys taken away.Enough of what? Handguns are more frequently used in this state for shootings than anything else. Handguns, largely, go unaddressed in this bill. This bill was done purely for show. Criminals are still going to get guns and people are still going to get shot.> there is a reason the AR15 has been used in so many mass shootings.\n\nThat reason is, they want to cause as much chaos and horror as possible and they know those guns make overly emotive momma-bear types lose their fucking minds. It gets them more instant fame, which is what they want most and exactly what we give them.\n\nThe notion that you can stop mass shootings by banning ARs is absolutely ridiculous. They would just switch to handguns (higher capacity and faster magazine changes--it would get worse, not better). The notion that mass shootings are common or even imminent is a master class in synthetic hysteria too.Assault rifles make it easier to kill many people ay once. That's not a show.We should ban handguns too.A .22 M&P 15-22 (banned under this bill) is in no way more deadly than something like a Ruger American bolt action which utilizes an AR style mag (not banned in this bill). I get where you\u2019re coming from and I wholeheartedly agree but this bill is silly.It can always be refined in the future. It's a start.I guess my point in all this is that I would rather have well thought out laws than ones that get rushed through just for political gain or to make people feel good. The vague wording makes it so vendors likely won\u2019t ship replacement parts (springs, firing pins, etc.). Banning threaded barrels on pistols doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense. You can still buy those same guns but without threaded barrels. Adding a compensator or silencer doesn\u2019t make them less deadly (at least not in the hands of your typical criminal). My opinion doesn\u2019t matter though and idk how much I care either way. I own guns and enjoy target shooting but I think this country absolutely has a gun problem and both sides are too stuck in their beliefs to agree on any meaningful reform. That speaks to a whole larger issue in this country though.",

[https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/markets/mortgage-rates-04212023](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/markets/mortgage-rates-04212023)I look to the New York Post for all of my financial information\u2026\u2026.Says the NY Post who's claim to fame is sports, gossip and horoscopesRupert Murdoch screwed up America and no decent person would read anything he puts out.Is the National Enquirer on the approved sources list for this subreddit?

Nypost is a garbage publicationBoomers who already own three houses are going to be furious over this issue that will 100% not affect them.Yeah, not a Biden problem NY Joke, it\u2019s a bipartisan problem that favors the rich and the banks. When shit crashes, they bail out anyone but the American people.[deleted]Most of us can\u2019t afford to buy a home and we\u2019re made to feel like trash because of it.\n\nFuck that.\n\nI can\u2019t afford to buy a home and neither can you!Good ruin housing as an investment and everyone who owns speculative property and let me laugh>\tNYPost\n\nMan this new legislation should be good for poor people![deleted]What else is new? It's BEEN screwed! Prices tripling in the last two to three years, ridiculous!Increasing cost of living is not going to be popular with voters, Interest rates constantly going up is going to fuck the housing market anyways.  The whole bullshit about this being done to provide affordable housing is absolute nonsense, no one but the wealthy are going to be buying housing with interest rates, inflation and consumer prices constantly increasing.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meanwhile is trying to cause widespread unemployment because people can afford services like Healthcare and Transportation...and Biden still has not removed Trumps nominee to the chair of the Fed.\n\nThis is just another way to bleed more money out of people...I dont know if Im going to laugh or scream when Biden loses because Democrats were too stupid to prevent policies like these from being implemented.It's white noise to me as the thing was already fubar for quite some time now. But like much of his decisions across his career, his own ideas are terrible policy decisions and when other people are presenting the big problems the country is facing he goes far short of the adequate solution in the name of a broad consensus. Well the broad consensus in Congress is to pass barely approaching adequate for the moment legislation if at all.Since folks were complaining it was any post article, herd are some other sources. \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/upside-down-mortgage-policy-212fd736\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/apr/18/joe-biden-hike-payments-good-credit-homebuyers-sub/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/biden-raises-costs-homebuyers-good-credit-help-risky-borrowers-1795700%3famp=1No one can afford a house because there\u2019s no protections in place to prevent shitty billionaires and companies buying up all the houses to simply rent to people which artificially drives the prices up to stupid fucking levels.\n\nThis problem already exists and has nothing to do with bidens mortgage equityWeird shit when by law the people who are better paying back loans are penalized for that in favor of people who are worse at paying back loans. \n\nIf the government mandates you can save thousands of dollars a year on a home loan by not paying your bills, what will the rational person do?\n\nHow does this idiocy fix anything?He\u2019s good at thatThis story is already made up. Here is their fucking twisted logic cuz none of these stories actually going into explaining HOW good credit people are getting fucked.\n\nThe top bracket for credit score was 740. Now they\u2019re splitting it at 740,760,780 which will have different fees while at the same time giving a discount to low credit homebuyers. In case it wasn\u2019t clear, higher credit score means LOWER fees. So in their mind someone with \u201cgood credit\u201d (740) will get penalized and thus Biden is punishing those with good credit. Completely narrow take. \n\nBut let\u2019s triple D: distort, divide and distract. The Rupert Murdoch way.The market has been fucked up for the last 2+ years, where has the NYCompost been?Giving money to people who can't repay loans for a house isn't the answer. It's exactly the thing that caused the recession back in 2008.I feel I'm smarter now thanks to your link!This still says interest rates go up for those with good credit... it's less sensational but it makes the exact same point.  More risky borrowers are subsidized by less risky borrowers.You might have been able to before this if your credit is decent.Or people who have sacrificed their whole life to build credit and savings.Or those who are barely scraping by who have sacrificed their whole life to build credit and savings.I'm pretty close, just waiting on market to drop.Or folks who are barely scraping by but have sacrificed to put themselves in a good position to buy.How?Washington Post?\nThis is the NY Post, the only mention in the article about the Washington Post is from 2012. Not sure what you\u2019re on about, or did you just mix up the publications?Ahh yes, an opinion piece in the wall street journal, one straight conservative site, and one conservative leaning site. There's the proofThat is a separate problem that I agree does happen and should be dealt with. It has nothing to do with hard working Americans who have sacrificed to get to a point of good credit who now are penalized for doing so.Next you\u2019ll tell me that you\u2019ll pay a higher rate in taxes if you make more money.They are ADDING a fee for those top brackets... how does that not say eff u to those who worked and sacrificed so much to have a good credit score to now gave a fee if their credit is good?\n\nYour logic is they could screw you more but they don't, which makes it fine...2008 was more about giving loans to people who clearly couldn't afford them and then selling them to other banks to deal with.Add to that,  those with GOOD credit abd higher down payment paying more in interest.People with higher credit scores still get a way better rate than those with lower credit scores. This isn't near as sensational as any of these articles make it soundTrue, but as stated my gripes are with Rich homeowners plus like the government would ever do something that useful.OP can't think critically. This is faux outrage bait.Not everyone who has a good credit score is rich. There are plenty of middle class people and lower class people with a high credit score? Now they too might have to suffer because now their interest rates might riseIt gets cheaper with higher credit scores. It was only in very little situations was there any substantial impact. \n\n[Rates after may 2023](https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/media/9391/display)\n\n[rates before 2023](https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/media/33201/display)\n\n\nIn addition they are putting an additional fee in certain cases a La the loan to value ratio being above 40% is gonna get hit with more fees. Basically they are trying to incentivize operating as FHA loans because most of the low credit score people have debt to income ratios above 40%. So they are imposing fees on loans granted above 40%. But the fees are waived typically for FHA qualifying loans. \n\nThey\u2019re doing this to help combat housing affordability issues.People with good credit don't get it through hard work or sacrifice, it just means that they had the equity to pay back loans they have taken out or are lucky enough not to have any major expenses or incidents that effect negatively on you credit. Most working class people will not have amazing credit scores unless they know how to balance finances, However; this is not a 100% guarantee. Many things can effect your credit or you building credit. Especially things out of peoples control like job security, health, economic area, location born. \n\nThe logic is sound most people in the working and middle class will have average credit and will be unaffected by this and realistically if you already have good credit you more then likely already own a home and will be unaffected as well. Generally to build up above average credit you will need something like a mortgage on it to do so.That was the second half of it. And there's no reason to think corrupt billionaires won't try the same thing again.That point of having good credit is to pay overall less.\n\nThere going to people with low rates (good credit) and increasing there payment just because. Its complete BS.So, as long as it screws the rich people it's fine? That's a bit like chopping off your nose to spite their eyes.There are certainly people who have faced things like major sickness and so forth and it affects their credit for sure. I'm all for folks having a chance to \"get back on track\" if they make dumb decisions as well. \n\nThat said you do get good credit by hard work and sacrifice. People aren't \"lucky enough\" to pay back loans, they generally avoid TAKING OUT LOANS they know they can't pay back. Again, sometimes crap does hit the fan, but it's ridiculous to think the ONLY way to get good credit is to just luck into it.Not really. They can write off losses, sell for a loss and absorb it easier than everyone else. \n\nMy SO and I are finally doing well making 140k/yr combined and no matter what we do, we cannot afford a house. That shouldn't be how it works. Unfortunately groups of investors and wealthy individuals have bought up everything around us, to make more money. Because of this EVERYTHING is 350k+, and if they can't rent it, or make a profit, it sits empty. Almost 60% of single family home sold in Orlando in the last 12 months were bought up buy wealthy investors, not families. That's a HUGE issue.\n\nWe're fortunate and have paid of college debt and don't owe a lot. We workhard and make good money. We shouldn't have to live in apartments that cost more than a home and drive 20 year old beaters around...Soooo, which side are you on here since it kinda sounds like your situation got far worse but you just complained about the investors buying up houses but also demonstrated how it won't even really impact the ultra rich since they can absorb/write off loss.",

How long must we remain in this pact of madness?They got auto sears / glock switches now anywayBump stocks are stupid, honestly it's only really the principle of the things that matters.\n\nYou can rig up a lot of methods to bump fire if you really want to. [if you are wearing pants with belt loops, you're already capable of bump firing a rifle.](https://youtu.be/lJ0jTMLK9jI), imitating full auto fire. Ban it or don't, no matter how you shake it bump stocks and bump firing is inaccurate and stupid.Bump stocks are stupid gimmicks, and are only designed to get around the effective ban on machine guns, but I do agree that the ATF shouldn\u2019t be allowed to rewrite the legal definition of a machine gun at their whim. If people want them banned, it needs to go through Congress.I guess bump stocks are an important part of any \u201cwell regulated militia.\u201d[The opinion (PDF)](https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/23a0086p-06.pdf)'Muricah! Freedumb!This was on my very short list of Trump policies I agreed with.Our court system is fucking despicable & has way too much power..Damn, first thing that came to my mind with the headline was the Dead Kennedy\u2019s cover of Viva Las Vegas:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XT72CgEJQNQ[deleted]Interesting fact: One of the judges that struck down the ban today was nominated by Trump.\u201cAccuracy through volume\u201d Any US saw gunner.Until those in power feel their life is in imminent dangermillions of firearms in the United States, and yet the US does not have millions mass shootings etc.\n\nYou might be interested to know, in the US, Chicago, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, have experienced hundreds more mass shootings than all other US cities.\n\nChicago, were firearm ownership is near illegal, is #1 for most mass shootings since 2013. \n\nAs for mass shootings in schools, workplace, it is a mental health issue, not an issue of an objectDoes an actual bump stock making fast firing easier then belt loops?  Is putting full auto fire into a crowd of a few hundreds require intense accuracy?\n\n[2017 Las Vegas shooting - 413 gunshot wounds or shrapnel injuries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting)But effective in killing a whole lot of people in dense crowds, in short order.People will always find a way around bans, the point is to make it too inconvenient for the general masses. People are free to buy ammonia and bleach at the grocery store, but that doesn't mean stores can sell mustard gasIf you build a robot to fire a gun for you, can that turn any gun into an automatic? That's not an arbitrary redefining of \"machine gun\", but a very real change in the nature of *Machine*.The legislation should have been written as \"number of rounds per second\" instead of \"machine gun\". Eliminate all the double talk, back door deals, and second hand mods from the equation in one fell swoop. \n\n\"All firearms capable of firing more than 2 rounds per second require a permit from the appropriate federal agency overseeing firearms\".So a federal agency should have the power to ignore the written law and arbitrarily ban things they don't like under a law that they specifically do not fall under but the courts shouldn't have the power to enforce the law as written?from the article:\n\n>The ban was enacted under former President Donald Trump in response to a deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas in which the shooter used guns equipped with bump stocks to kill 58 people and wound hundreds more.  \n>  \n>Bump stocks use a semiautomatic's recoil to allow it to slide backwards and forwards while \"bumping\" the shooter's trigger finger, resulting in rapid fire.  \n>  \n>ATF determined in 2017 that the devices, which had previously been allowed, were machine guns under the National Firearms Act of 1934. Federal law prohibits the sale or possession of machine guns, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Well, duh.  Lol\u2026How is that interesting. They confirmed these people because they already know how they will decide..In my experience, when it comes to the M249, it's more \"Fuck!  Another jam!\"On your last point, yes and no. \n\nImagine for me that every recent school shooter/workplace shooter carried out their plans with a gun but imagine that the gun had the functional ability of a donut. How many people would have been killed? Same attacker, same plan, same mental illness - how many killed by a donut?\n\nTo bring it into a more realistic space - a knife. Guns are unique in the speed at which you can inflict damage, the amount of damage you can inflict, and the distance from which you can inflict it. Imagine again the same attackers, same mental illnesses, same plans but a knife instead of a gun. They\u2019d definitely kill someone and more than a donut but how many when they have to be up close to each victim, when they have to use their own physicality to inflict each blow, and when people often survive multiple stab wounds? \n\nIs it realistic to suggest that far less of those children would have died if their very same attackers with their very same mental illnesses would have died if it was a knife instead of a gun?\n\nI\u2019m not necessarily anti-gun by the way, but the mass ownership of lethal weapons designed or manipulated to discharge round after round of lethal ammunition in the shortest amount of time possible is not sustainable in a country that doesn\u2019t do anything to address the types of mental illness or root causes of gang violence you appear to care so much about highlighting.Does the US have more people with mental health issues than other countries? The fact that there are more mass shootings in this country compared to other countries can\u2019t be blamed on mental health. The difference lies in the proliferation and worship of guns in this country.Federal law states that \u201cthe term \u2018machinegun\u2019 means any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d - [26 U.S. Code \u00a7 5845 - Definitions (b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5845)\n\nBy that definition, it doesn\u2019t matter what actuates the trigger, whether it\u2019s your finger or a robot designed to pull a trigger, the only thing that matters is how many bullets are fired by a single action of the trigger. More interestingly, something like [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_Firearms_AF2011A1) abomination might fall under the definition of a machine gun if it doesn\u2019t have two triggers given each trigger pull would fire two rounds (one from each barrel). \n\nStandard IANAL disclaimer.[removed]So, no guns should be legal aside from break action single shot firearms? Here\u2019s [lever action](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n68PJM5bazM). How about a [pump action](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3m-WNk44hI&t=85)? Here\u2019s a [bolt action](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x_a7pXWi6xo). And of course, let\u2019s not forget the trusty [revolver](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WzHG-ibZaKM). \n\nChoosing what to ban based on human capabilities is a foolish idea.That would be any gun capable of holding more than 2 rounds, like a revolver. Here's 8 shots in under a second!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TU1QET13apc\n\nYou'd leave people with single shots, bolt action, or double barreled weapons.Federal agencies are given the power to regulate things, including firearms, from Congress. They can create regulations as they see fit. They don't need to be specifically spelled out in Congressional bills.And this is the consequence of trying to take a short cut, rather than properly getting a bill passed. \n\nI'm no bump stock fan, but this does not make a semiauto an automatic weapon. Literally the trigger is pulled once per round fired.Right!Unrelated point, but the idea of someone being killed by a donut is fucking hysterical.The US does have rampant inequality with poor social programs and an non-socialized Healthcare system.\n\nInequality is a far better predictor of all violent crime than gun ownership rates.We have had many more serial killings per capita than other countries (at least countries that keep decent records). So yeah, I reckon America does have a mental health problem.Are you suggesting that people of sound mind commit the mass shootings?\n\nAnd accepting there are millions of firearms in the United States, and so few mass shootings compared to number of firearms, it isn't the object.\n\nThe object does not function without human operating it.If that's the definition they're using, it's so poorly-written it isn't clear whether assault rifles count.\n\nThey can automatically fire more than one shot, but they can be turned to semi-auto mode, so it's not \"automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d\n\nLawmakers seem to be so determined to avoid \"split infinitives\" that they leave stranded adverbs everywhere.But no regs for any guns because of 2nd amendment while we are reading regs on the 2nd amendment. I bring this up often to 2nd amendment people, we regulate all kinds of guns - the response is \u201cduh\u201dWhy do I remember shooting a gun during my childhood that shot 3 rounds per trigger pull?  Was the 80\u2019s but almost feel like it looked like a hunting rifle.Except the robot is 'designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun'.That power to regulate is based in the law. Unless their power to regulate is from a law saying \"item X is defined by these specific terms.\" They do not have the power to ignore those terms and regulate anything, such as a fundamental right, that does not meet those terms because they personally don't like it.Especially when using M-16 mags instead of belt-fed.\n\nYou could probably rename mags used in a SAW as \"jam firing adapters\", to maintain naming symmetry with other accessories, such as the blank firing adapter.I\u2019m suggesting that other countries have the same amount of mental health issues as this country does. Why don\u2019t you see the mass shootings there? You\u2019re right; the object does not function without the human operating it. There are too many objects for the human> If that's the definition they're using, it's so poorly-written it isn't clear whether assault rifles count.\n\nThat definition is not poorly-written. Assault Rifle very clearly count as they have a selector to shoot more than one shot by a single function of the trigger. Yes you can put it into another mode that disables that ability but it still has the ability by default.I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re trying to say, I have failed to parse your comment.It might have been a legally registered machine gun. In the 80\u2019s, the registry was still open and machine guns had a similar price point to other rifles. The only difference is you had to pay a $200 tax stamp to the ATF so you could register the machine gun before you took it home.Years ago at Ft Drum, I believe someone was seriously injured or killed because a cleaning rod was left inside a barrel and blanks were used.But you have to select that mode. It's not automatically that mode.\n\nI think they intended \"automatically\" to modify \"shoot,\" but they moved it out of the way, where it modifies \"more.\"It\u2019s the \u201cshall not be infringed\u201d statement in the 2nd amendment he\u2019s referring to.  \n\nThis is what opposition for gun control is based around, they\u2019ll say any law restricting gun access is an infringement. \n\nWith such an interpretation the stamp system for SBR and automatic weapons and the prohibition of felons along with the background check system are all infringements. \n\nAnd since it says \u201carms\u201d and not guns, such an open interpretation would apply to nukes and bombs as well.> The only difference is you had to pay a $200 tax stamp to the ATF so you could register the machine gun before you took it home.\n\nThat's still how full auto and the ATF work (approximately).  You pay $200, undergo an background check, pass the background check and then take it home when approved.\n\nThe only difference is you can't own anything made after 1986 or that isn't already in the registry.> machinegun means any weapon that can be readily restored to shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger.\n\nWhich is very clearly what a selector switch on an assault rifle does.> This is what opposition for gun control is based around, they\u2019ll say any law restricting gun access is an infringement.\n\nHave I said anything of the sort?You\u2019re kind of glossing over the biggest difference. Because the registry is closed to new machine guns, the existing 180,000 or so have skyrocketed in price to $10,000-$50,000. The main part of my point above was not that you could more easily register a machine gun in 1980, it was that machine guns were not significantly more expensive than other comparable semi-automatic rifles. They were within reach for anyone who wished to purchase one. Nowadays they are out of reach for most people.If that's clearly anything to you, then we have different ideas of English grammar.They as in those opposed to any new form of gun control.  \n\nIf I was talking about you in person I would have used he or you.  \n\nPronouns; I know they are \u201ccontroversial\u201d these days but they actually have meaning.\n\nThe threats were uncontrolled and came from outside the community while in our system, our leaders coordinate with the outside threats to consolidate power.Let\u2019s be honest, lawyers and the general public have drastically different ideas of English grammar.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*I think that says more than enough about them, if I'm being honest.*Subpoena him*, and when he doesn't show, *arrest him*.\n\nGod damnit show some fucking spine.The Supreme Court's only real power is creditabilty. Without that, they don't really have any power?  Really bad move. Their decisions can be ignored as well, this can go both ways.Every bit of the problem with the Supreme Court today is just a symptom of the real problem- Congress. If you want to fix SCOTUS you have to fix Congress.\n\nCongress has increasingly failed or refused to take action on countless key issues. Guns, abortion, voting, immigration, budgets, war, etc. When that happens, Congress effectively abdicates its power and one of the other branches is forced to take action on it. This has contributed to the expansion of Executive Branch powers and the politicization of SCOTUS.\n\nWhen these issues land on SCOTUS, often arising from a law passed to address the issue at the state level or an Executive Order, it results in a growing body of case law underpinning major aspects of society that should be properly coded into law or amendments to the Constitution. It is *insane* that the issue of abortion rested on a 40+ year old court ruling. It's *mind-boggling* that overturning that ruling endangers other key issues like interracial marriage. If Congress was functioning as it was supposed to, those and more would have been addressed decades ago.\n\nSince Congress continually passes the buck on these issues and Executive Orders inevitably wind up at the Court, Democrats and Republicans have been increasingly focused on the makeup of the court. You can practically hear members of both parties jizz in their pants when a Justice dies. This is not the way a functioning democracy should operate.\n\nWe desperately need to unfuck Congress.\n\n-edit-\n\nCongress is paralyzed because Democrats and Republicans have effectively split the country 50/50, creating an impasse. They will not risk losing a seat on a divisive issue, and they will not support any bill brought by the opposing party. They haven't even successfully passed an annual budget on time since ***1996***. The only way to break that stalemate is to break the two-party hold on this country. We need to address gerrymandering, institute ranked choice voting, pass a new Voting Rights Act, overturn Citizen's United, and probably institute term limits.\n\nThat is a long, challenging road but it is absolutely the way we need to go. Congressional deadlock is fueling violent extremism in this country and it will only get worse the longer it goes.So the Supreme court is just going to go rogue now and refuse to be held accountable or even asked about there actions. Then states should refuse to follow orders from the court.Then Chief Justice Roberts can shut his mouth about people questioning the legitimacy of his courtAll it would take is just one left leaning judge to do something that just appears to violate the ethics of the court and the right wing would trip over itself to impose standards and subpoena that judge before Congress.[Letter from Chief Justice to Dick Durbin](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Letter-to-Chairman-Durbin-04.25.2023.pdf)so subpoena him to testify.\n\nseparate but equal, right?I am all for a reroll of the entire court at this point.  It\u2019s a joke.Lots of people saying that Roberts declined tells the story. I think the real story is something else.\n\nIt's not that he declined. It's *how* he declined.\n\n- Shot: _\"extraordinarily rare. ... separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence.\"_\n- Chaser: _\"routine matters of of judicial administration relating to additional judgeships in the lower courts and jurisdiction over appeals from lower court injunctions.\"_\n- Sidecar: Rehnquist showed up to talk about _\"mundane topics\"_ including _\"improvements to the federal civil service system\" and \"Justice Marshall Memorial Coin\"_\n- Closing time: Here's our Statement of Ethics Principles and Practices you can go fuck off with.\n\nClarence Thomas has a derecho of ethics issues over his head. Samuel Alito is doing his best to convince everyone he went to the Mike Lindell Upstairs School of Law and Bartending (seriously, did you read that Mifepristone dissent? Fuck!), and Gorsuch couldn't offload real estate for 2 years - in a good market - until 9 days after he gets sworn into the bench, and the buyer runs a conservative law firm which does a lot of SCOTUS work. Abe Fucking Fortas got shitcanned in '68(?) for taking $15,000 to do some college seminars.\n\nAnd Roberts is effectively lumping the 2023 SCOTUS Shitshow in with _\"routine matters\"_ and _\"mundane topics\"_ like appeals jurisdictions and civil service improvements.\n\nThat wasn't a sorry-not-sorry letter. That was a big ol' go fuck yourself.Don\u2019t worry guys. He said it was okay \ud83d\udc4dPure corruption, the majority of the US Supreme Court is bought and paid for by Billionaires.I thought we had a system of checks and balances to prevent this situation?Can't testify about something you lack...No checks. No balances. Just fuck Americans. That's all.I no longer consent to being governed by the Supreme Court. It\u2019s completely illegitimate and ran by radical fascists.Every time you want to give Chief Justice John Roberts the benefit of the doubt, that he will take the higher ground and do what is best for his country - he pulls this shit.>\tChief Justice John Roberts is 100% complicit in the deligitmization of the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nTurns out he\u2019s not the \u201cmoderate justice\u201d; he\u2019s actually just as big of a piece of shit as the other conservative judges\n\n(That\u2019s not a real quote btw)Of course he won't. He's \"concerned\" about the public's lack of confidence in the court. If he said literally anything on the matter it'll only deepen that lack of confidenceThey are no longer a valid branch of the government then. Impeachment him and replace him.And yet he worries about the legitimacy of the court?\n\nFuck this guy and fuck Clarence Thomas and every person who defends him. They want us to know, explicitly, that there are laws for some and not for others.The Supreme Court has no ethics to testify about.Lifetime appointments with no laws that can keep them in check means you're appointing people with the absolution fuck you powers. They can do anything. The cat's out of the bag. SCOTUS is rogue.We better not hear one more fucking word from the \u201cHonorable Chief Justice Roberts\u201d about how he is concerned about the perceived legitimacy of the Supreme Court.So instead of affecting the outcomes of cases by having certain members recuse, they affect the outcome by becoming financially entangled with people with business before the court. \n\nThey\u2019ve truly fucked themselves\u2014 there\u2019s no reason not to restructure the court and introduce term limits now. If the Chief Justice won\u2019t address the very legitimate questions created by the actions of his colleagues then they obviously feel themselves above the law. Defund them until they shape up, add seats, add term limits, introduce a strict ethics code; make them follow the same rules as everyone else.John Roberts thinks he's above the law. \n\nThe Supreme Court has become a corrupt cesspool because of him.\u201cWe\u2019ve investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing\u201dChief Justice Robert\u2019s will go down in history as perhaps the most famous chief Justice since John Marshall because in a single generation he has failed to act and thus failed to maintain the independence and reputation of our court systemsWhat is that I hear?  An invitation for reporters to question Roberts about ethics at every opportunity?Because there is no ethics.Honestly, we heard about Thomas, we heard about Gorsuch.  As time goes on, Roberts not talking makes me wonder.The US Supreme is now an illegitimate shit show thanks to this weak bellied man. The majority of the justices support an American Taliban style government run by Christians who hate everyone not willing to worship their made up God; And the SC has consistently turned a blind eye to a grifter style government that lines the pockets of judges, and elected officials! America you have allowed this self proclaimed star chamber to be our masters masters. It\u2019s time for the Supreme Court to be abolished. Send them packing to the crazy Christian Cults and mansions in Florida.Time for Congress to assert its position as \"first among equals\" and subpoena his ass.\n\nLiterally no one is above the law or the Constitution, even the Chief Justice of SCOTUS.\n\nRoberts is free to decline a \"request,\" obviously.  And he's free to turn up in response to a subpoena and give nothing answers.  But it's about time the motherfuckers are held accountable to We The People.>*If the full Court or any subset of the Court were to review the recusal decisions of individual Justices, it would create an undesirable situation in which the Court could affect the outcome of a case by selecting who among its Members may participate.*\n\nInstead you just have multiple judges accepting probably millions of dollars in gifts from \"friends\" who clearly have interests in multiple cases before the court because the gifts would stop if they actually had morals and recused themselves when appropriate.His argument about separation of powers is bull. The point of separation of powers is so one branch of government doesn't go batshit crazy. Oversight is well within seperation of powers. That's why Congress can investigate the Executive, and the same applies for the judicialIf only there were some kind of systems of checks and balances whereby the various halls of power were designed to impose limits upon one another. Alas,Something Something Separation of Powers... Checks and Balances...Essentially pleading the 5th so as not to incriminate himself!Why is that even an option?  This country needs a hard reset.  Way too many people in this country are in a position of power with zero oversight.The same guy who declared that racism no longer exists in the USA and watered down the voters rights act will not testify about ethics? Mr. Jim Crow himself. The Supreme Court is no longer for the people by the people. Evil Clarence Thomas knows it and has profited so well. Roberts does not have a hand to play.Surprising no one.  Destroy the SCOTUS.Why even pretend to have a code of ethics at this point? When asked, why not just whip that junk out and swing it around in circles like a helicopter. It doesn't matter. A Supreme Court Justice hasn't been removed in well over 200 years. Consequences don't apply to them, so why pretend like you're not a bunch of frat boys having a power trip party?Which is fine, because you typically need to be an expert on the subject matter to testify to Congress, and Roberts knows nothing about ethics.fucking diane finesteinPolitical pawns trying to save their credibility. This didn\u2019t help.So much for a system of \"Checks & Balances\". When one-third of the system declares it is exempt from oversight by the others, it is irrevocably broken.He can't testify about Supreme Court ethics because there isn't any.If Congress thinks that they have something on Thomas, the recourse is to impeach him. It's not to attempt to summon the Chief Justice in a kangaroo Congressional hearing.Can't testify about something you know nothing about.This was his opportunity to show some courage and leadership, and start removing the stain from the \"Roberts Court\". He could have worked towards healing the left-right schism across politics by encouraging everyone to be more ethical, honest and non-partisan and actively inviting Biden to appoint specific apolitical moderate or less radical conservative justices so that ethically problematic justices can be impeached or simply sidelined. \n\nInstead cowardice and danger to the republic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInsteadThat tracks.Of course not. Why would he?Lol...of course he's not.These ivory tower justices make rulings everyone has to live by except themselves.You can\u2019t really testify on something you know nothing about.Illegitimate court acting improperly.His legacy of being chief creep of the creepy court is assured. There's nothing he can say to anyone, nothing he can do for anyone, that'll change that.So much for him caring about his legacy and the legitimacy of the court.It's because he has none.Roberts should resign in shame. He\u2019s lost control of his position. He wields no confidence or authority as Chief. The court is the most corrupt it has been since the Civil War.But no doubt he'll continue to whine about people questioning the legitimacy of his court....To the surprise of absolutely no oneSomething something checks and balancesZero accountability for them.Coward. We need to disband the entire Supreme Court. The level of corruption is insane.Checks and balances my ass.that's called \"i am above the law\"\"Voluntarily\"Why should he? It is an obvious waste of time as the Supreme Court does not have any ethics, so nothing to talk about\u2026\u2026Beg my Ignorance but how does the process work on getting a Supreme Court justice impeached? \n\nIs it through Congress? \n\nBecause that would be something the Democrats should be putting in their platform to run on for the next election.\n\nObviously the Supreme Court needs far more oversight than previously thought.Yeah, illegitimate court.He is establishing his court legacy and it's not greatYou know in other countries, Supreme Court judges have a retirement age.Damn, just more talk. No way it can be reformed, yet alone impeaching Thomas won\u2019t happen either. The fix is in.Because remember - the Constitution only matters to serve their ends. The explicit need of Congress to be a check on SCOTUS be fucking damned.Subpoena him and, when he doesn\u2019t show up, use inherent contempt to throw his ass in jail.The (R) makes this completely fine.... no need to testify in front of \"other\" people.....SCOTUS Justices are appointed for \u2018a period of good behavior\u2019. I recon refusing to testify before congress counts as bad behavior.SCOTUS has a credibility problem. John Roberts playing politics here.\u201cI couldn\u2019t be bothered to enforce my own workplace mask mandate during COVID. Why would I care about workplace ethics?\u201d -Chief Justice RobertsIs this a case of laws don't apply to justices or laws don't apply to Republicans? I can't tell, but I can all but guarantee if a Republican-led committee asked a Democrat Justice to testify, Roberts would make them do it.Fraudulent Justice appointed by a fraudulent president installed by a fraudulent Court.How can he testify about something he doesn't have? That'd be like me testifying about NBA championship rings.Yeah, because he is guilty also.Garland wont do shit and neither will congress.  These people are above the law.Hey John? FUCK YOUR LEGACY. I hope history remembers you as the weak, cowardly POS that you truly are.Fly in whatever is left of Fenstein to vote to subpoena this punk. He and his cabal are wholly corrupt.Congress will have to do what SCOTUS won\u2019t.  Like that will happen.They have ethics?Of course, not, he doesn\u2019t know anything about ethics. The Roberts court is a stain on America. He\u2019s apparently fine with that.Circling the wagons is not a good look for the court during a time when the court is looking very bad. Roberts is writing the legacy of the worst court in a lifetime.WHo would've thought legalizing corruption would lead to this.....oh wait, citizens united was a terrible decision and is destroying our country.   What a bunch of f'ing traitors conservatives are.  They should move to Russia.Congress: Chief Justice, we\u2019re going to need you to come in and testify before Congress. The number of controversies facing your court is unprecedented and the public is losing faith in the Court as an institution. \n\nRoberts: I don\u2019t want to. \n\nCongress: Sorry bother you, your honor. Have a wonderful day.Well maybe it's time to defund his court..  Maybe one of his billionaire donors can pay the bills for the building.Most nakedly corrupt supreme court bench> Durbin dismissed the statement as a \u201crecounting of existing legal standards of ethics\u201d and said that Roberts\u2019 suggestion that current law is adequate \u201cignores the obvious.\u201d\n\n[John Roberts IRL:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZfqdrI5HgI)He's above the law and he knows it.Then make him.Sounds like he doesn't have any ethics to testify forThen make him do it. Why does he get to opt out? Biden should add 3 more justices while the Senate majority is Democrat.I wonder if he realizes yet that the Roberts court will almost certainly go down in SCOTUS history as the most visibly corrupt and partisan court of at least the last 50 years, and possibly the court that ultimately shatters Americans' trust in the institution for good.Of course not he's a coward.Only one SCOTUS justice (Samuel Chase) has ever been impeached, and even then he wasn't actually removed from office (he was acquitted by the Senate).  \n  \nOur present congress absolutely lacks the votes (66% required) to impeach a SCOTUS justice.Chief justice statement:\n\n>I ain't no snitch.Excuse me, sir. I don't think you understand how checks and balances work...Ah, he's pulling the Trump card. Just don't cooperate. Nice.Difficult to testify about Supreme Court ethics, as it\u2019s something in such short supply. Parts of America are becoming like the countries that they used to defend against,  and \u201cpolice the world\u201d for. History is moving very fast of late.We, the people, can demand a reckoning with these 6 clearly partisan, clearly bought-and-paid-for judges.  And we should.\n\nnewspapers, talk shows, The View, Twitter, and everywhere there is conversation, this must be the subject.  We cannot have a nation in which justice is not seen to prevail.Remove him. This is abdication of duty, and I'm thoroughly sick and tired of politicians simply deciding to not do their job because the result will inconvenience them.\"It's a big club and you ain't in it\" - George CarlinQuis custodiet ipsos custodes?Of course not - that would require him to have some ethics and I think we've established that SC Justices largely don't.Why not just say something like, \"We are above the law. We are the law. And we will hold your country hostage to our views.\"?They are above the law. Where are you going to go to complain?  There needs to be civilian oversight of Supreme Court.He has got people he owes.  Guy has been bought.PussyUltimately, he knows there's no defense, doesn't want to be seen as defending it, nor does he want to condemn it. His is the response of wishy-washy cowardice, cloaked in noble sounding legalisms in his mind, no doubt.Checks and Balances my ass.\n\nThe entire point of the 3 coequal branch system was so that the one branch could be checked by the others. When the ONLY branch with unelected, life-time appoints is able to simply say \"Nah I don't feel like getting checked\" then the system is a failure. Simply refusing to be checked should result in expulsion, but it won't, because we're not actually a democracy.Lol, Roberts?  Talking about *ethics?*\n\n\ud83d\ude02So, just assume he's the root of the problem since he is the Chief?ImpeachIt's like going to play cards and the DEALER is John Robert's and the players are Gorsuch, Thomas and you. \nStacked deckChicken Shit.Because of COURSE he won\u2019t. They\u2019re all criminals who fudge their disclosures.[deleted]Yeah I bet notThe court is going rogue. Oh look, another thing the founders predicted and tried to prepare our government to handle\u2026Translation: You take care of your corruption and we\u2019ll take care of ours.The oversite committee for the SC are the voters and I guess we can add that to the fucking oopsie the founding fathers had when they said the SC is a lifetime appointment. Those old sad fucks thought the senate couldn\u2019t be corrupted. \n\nWas that decreed before or after land had voting rights? Why does capitalism / land have human American rights in any case? Doesn\u2019t that ultimately mean the people who rent or own small plots have fewer federal representation since states have two senators per state? \n\nYet, it all makes sense because the right says it wants fucked more and the left just lets it happen while saying words that mean nothing. \n\nSeems like we need a new left. And I guess we just keep voting left until the new ones win. People who vote right or backward need to be negated by votes forward.Surprise surprise. I think we need to have a constitutional amendment that makes supreme court justices an elected position and not a lifetime appointment by a lame duck president.> Chief Justice John Roberts will not testify before Congress about Supreme Court ethics\n\nHe probably said that he had better things to do.It would have been very unusual for him to appear and testify before congress.  He is the head of judicial branch of government.  When is last time majority (or minority) leader of congress testified in any court?So why shouldn\u2019t i believe the entire supreme court is corrupt at this point (and not just the 6 right wing judges)?The court turns conservative and ALL OF A SUDDEN, it's corrupt. Please!That would be because his license to be a lawyer would be revoked because he lied on the stand under oath.  And I'm pretty damn sure you have to be a lawyer in order to be a judge. And we all know because the same that supreme court, congressman and senators, and ex-president don't have any ethics. But that billionaires and millionaires corporations or other things to these people and nobody has to report it is a slap in the face to regular American Joe citizens.Yet\u2026. Drag Clarence Thomas through the same mud?\n\nThis sub is a fucking joke. Was never like this a couple years ago.Can\u2019t reasonably expect him to testify on ethics when he doesn\u2019t have any.  4D chess move.Okay so he won't be just barred but he still can be held accountable for lying under oath. And if you don't have to be a judge to be on the supreme court, and I take you at your words, you should be. But isn't he a lawyer? If so he would then be just barred for lying under oath.I\u2019m sure roberts is dirty as fuck as well\u2026Personal integrity is dead. We need mandatory disclosure, strict ethics policy and new paths to terminate justices who violate standards. The Justices have proven that they cannot be trusted as independent ethical operators.Just buy his moms house, renovate it to luxury, and let her live there rent free. Apparently that's the only way to get these chuckle-fucks to do anything these days.He probably just has a trip with a friend at the same time.I read through those Judicial ethics and that\u2019s some Mickey Mouse rules. That\u2019s the problem. Those need to be revised to deal with people who don\u2019t hold themselves to same moral standard as Judges in the past. There is literally nothing about accepting bribes or monetary gifts. Hell, I work in retail and we are not even allowed for other people to pay for dinner man. That\u2019s complete bullshit.Can't testify about something that doesn't existThat's really the only question that needed answering.Why would he? He\u2019s accountable to no one.Of course not, that would be basic, constitutional oversight /sGrow a spine and hold the other branch of government responsibleRogue Justice. Subpoena him.The fuck? He was given a choice?!Not a good look for the Chief Justice.How can he testify about Supreme Court ethics when he doesn\u2019t have any ethics?So funnyBecause the supreme's have NO ethics!Never thought he would. There are no laws to hold them accountable, except impeachment, which won\u2019t happen because their buddies control the house.Seems\u2026unethical\u2026.So many people in the comments don't seem to understand that the Senate didn't subpoena Roberts, they just sent a letter asking him to come in voluntarily. Roberts is totally within his rights to say \"no thanks\" to that. Whether or not deciding not to appear is a good look for him and SCOTUS is another matter, but it's perfectly legal.\n\nIf the Senate actually wants to FORCE Roberts to show up they need to subpoena him. If he refuses a subpoena then that's a totally different scenario!Could have told you he would not testify come on he probably is just as badGrifter doesn\u2019t want to testify, how originalLol.  What a shocker.Laws for you, not for meDisgusting human being.  NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW including SCOTUS !They have no moral authority anymoreOh it\u2019s like that huh?\n\nUS Marshals would be carrying any of us to the \u201cinvitation\u201d given by the SC.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tough subject.  Yeah nah.  I\u2019m out\u201dShocking.Why would he, he doesn\u2019t report to them, he reports to the 1%.Why not?How do you \"respectfully decline\" even this kind of light checks and balances?\n\nThis court is obviously rudderless and out of control.Literally makes no senseFox says other foxes are watching those delicious hens just fine..Can't testify about something that doesn't existOur betters don\u2019t like to be questioned.It looks really bad when your court's ethics are nonexistent...Senate commission time. Let's keep digging.Time for the Supreme Court to get restructured, these corrupt fucks are selling out our rights to the highest bidderIt's a losing proposition for him, he's going to be asked if he will tolerate or has tolerated corruption among justices if he shows.\n\nHe'll be called out for inaction if he doesn't. \n\nAll he can do is play for time, hoping that Thomas feels the heat and gets the hint to step down.Probably sensible.  He'd be asked if he knew about Thomas and almost certainly he did, and did nothing.Of course not. Nobody actually thought that he would.All men are created equal.  \n\nWhat a sad, naive joke.Above the law and/or no shame, conscience or soul.Because?REPUBLICA - DO Your thing. Investigate him!I am above the law!Crooked white people man.\"I'm not questioning him about the ethics of the Supreme Court, I'm denying their existence.\"Roberts cries himself to sleep every night knowing nobody gives his court any legitimacy\nThat seems fair. Why should he speak about something that doesn\u2019t exist?In other words, several of us  have none.And, of course, he doesn't have the balls to offer any testimony as well.Can we appeal that to the\u2026oh wait\u2026never mind. No, no ethical issues WHATSOEVER.Can we just rename it to the Reichsgericht?  It is acting exactly the same.\n\n[Nazi High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reichsgericht&oldid=1123588110)> \u201cTestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns and **the importance of preserving judicial independence**,\u201d he added.\n\nDid he manage to dictate that without laughing at how absurd it sounds?Because he doesn\u2019t have any ethicsCoward.  Your legacy is trashOligarchs won't come to the body of the \"elected\"\n\nGeez this system is broken.Fucking subpoena him then.  Fucking ridiculous Can congress subpoena a justice to testify under oath? I thought they could?I don't think they understand what the term \"ethics\" means to normal people.I guess the point would be: what if he did show up? \n\nIf he shit on Thomas then he would just make an enemy for the next 20 years. It's not like Thomas is known for ignoring personal slights, and no impeachment would ever pass the Senate. \n\nAnd if he approved of the action, it would make him look bad. \n\nEither way it would just be a spectacle that demonstrates he has no control over the court or the individual justices in it. I can see why he declined.Surprise surprise. No way to force him so he\u2019s not going to. Carry on with corruption and questionable ethics. Doesn\u2019t matter anymore, SCOTUS is useless as a branch of government for a while.About WHAT?  Probably ignoring it because he don't know what it about because he has never seen any.The courts have the exact same problem the other branches have. Greed, power hungry, ideological, selfish, leveraged.I don't see anything wrong with this move. He shouldn't be expected to testify about something if he has no knowledge or experience with it.It would be a waste of time anyway. Nothing would come out of it but a few headlines.Eff around and find outHistory will not be kind to the Roberts court if the rest of us can hold onto our freedom.  There's a lot that isn't very ethical about some of these folks.Because the supreme court has no ethics.I always thought Roberts was OK but he\u2019s shown himself to be of the same ilk as Clarence Thomas and all of the other corrupt republicans who shit all over the constitution. It\u2019s time for some accountability. Subpoena him in the Senate. They\u2019ve fucked around enough it\u2019s time for them to find out something (within the confines of the law).\u2026 because he is as corrupt as his co-workers.The paraphrase one of my favorite Family Guy jokes (Jeremy Irons\u2019 Cereal)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for ethics, there are none.  It\u2019s quite corrupt, I assure you\u2026How unethical of he to fail to do his dituWhat would he even say, \u201cethics?\u201dAlito still can't figure out how people could question the integrity of the court. Maybe if he asks John Roberts about it he'll get an answer. Maybe not.Well Congress members grilling anyone about ethics is kind of a joke though right?Lol he\u2019s probably like hell nah I got a bunch of shit I don\u2019t want them to know about tooi get oversight over you! you don't get oversight over me!\n\nim gonna go sell a paperclip to the highest bidder of people who have a case before the court this summer.Well, it\u2019s hard to testify on something you\u2019re not familiar with..What a f'in POS.surprise surprise, he's likely caught up in a lot of bad shit too!If they admit Thomas pay off then they open up for all of their payoffs.Did anyone for a second think he would? You have to force these guys to do anything. They\u2019re not going to volunteer.He does not get a pass!! When are we going to take to the streets and fight? What\u2019s the straw that will finally break the camels back?I mean it would just be twelve hours of silence>\u201cTestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence,\u201d he added.\n\nI feel like he doesn't understand what \"separation of powers\" or \"judicial independence\" mean if he really is serious about using these as his excuse. I mean, what?Quit pussy footing around. Subpoena every one of the justices and ask them the same questions on their disclosures or lack thereof. That will quickly display to the public who is on the take.because he\u2019s fucking stupidGrievances hit hard at SCOTUS. Roberts rebuffs efforts to find moralsHow de they flout the law like this?! They are NOT kings!And potentially ruin their grift? Hell no he won\u2019t testify. None of the conservative judges will.Wtf. Why is it even a choice?Well the only thing higher than then the Justices is in the sky.SuspishWell, that\u2019s suspicious\u2026He\u2019s not the only justice he\u2019s just the chief justice\u2026ask them all to testifyWhen a player for a team is also the referee for the game - it\u2019s a real shit show to watch.He's part of a coequal government. Whether he wants to or not is irrelevant. Drag his ass before the public and hold him accountable!They don\u2019t even care how bad this looks because WHY they can do whateverTF they want all the damn time.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think about RBG - she had to know about this shady shit for years.Well a bigliest Fuck You John Roberts ! You're an incompetent manager of the Supreme or should I say \"semi-supreme court\"you will never achieve your dreams and history will look at you and your tenure as the total piece of diarrhetic shit you're' willing to allow your OUTLAW FUCKING JUSTICES  to remain on your lawless , discredited court ...Testify Asshole!!!If only Gore hadn't chose Republican Lieberman as his running mate. The entire world would be different.He needs to resign and hideout, he's no longer responding to relevant data that threatens his position and the viability of the court itself... I don't have any trust left in the court with Alito, Gorsuch, Thomas, or Roberts on it! Fuck You John Roberts from a 67 year old parent of 9 year old twins that's worked all his life to earn his citizenship and believing in this country!\nResign, it's about all you've got left, I knew you were corrupt after the George Bush election and hoped you'd attempt to redeem yourself... All I've got left is a Stupendous, Resounding,Total Fuck You to the \"Supreme Justice \" of the \"Supreme Court \" of the United States \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udd95You reek of TrumpSwamp!And say what?Fuck John Roberts.Recuses himself from being unethical\u2026.PussyHey there! I understand that it can be frustrating when someone declines to testify, but don't let that discourage you. Keep pushing for transparency and accountability, and continue to advocate for a fair and just court system. Your voice and efforts matter!I wouldn\u2019t believe anything any of these guys said.\ud83d\udeab  Checks and balances \n\ud83d\udeab separation of church and state\n\ud83d\udeab Abortion rights\n\u2b55\ufe0f Gay rights\n\u2b55\ufe0f Free and fair elections\n\u2b55\ufe0f Transgender rights at national level\n\nThings are going great guys.  . . right?The court looks terrible now from top to bottom. Time for reforms to be imposed on them all.How ethical of himDamn, but Reddit told me he\u2019s barely a conservative!  That he\u2019s basically a moderate!Your silence speaks volumes, sir.Roberts can\u2019t do that because his own unethical behavior is linked to Clarence Thomas\u2019: nepotism.  As the architect of the Bush v Gore slime show, Roberts knows that the whole house of cards comes tumbling down, were he ever to flinch.\n\nRoberts also knows that his entire career has already been dissected, that he and his ilk will rest in infamy rather than peace, for they are proof there is no justice.Senator: \u201cJustice Roberts, can you please explain ethics?\u201d\n\nRoberts: \u201cI do not recall.\u201dCiting lack of understanding on the issue, presumably.He needs to be told... \"get your house in order, or we will\". \n\nYes it's not possible right now for a variety of reasons but it needs to happen sooner rather than later. He's abdicating his responsibilities.When he thought the Roe leaker was a liberal he was on Paul Revere\u2019s ride to bring ethics back to the Supreme Court. Been pretty silent lately. Weird.How ethical of him.We make the laws! - SCOTUSIn short, he's so corrupt he believes that he's above the law.    \n\n\nTime to Impeach him off the benchMight catch shit for this, but politicians should have an age gap of 65. \n\nAll these old fucks running the show are making the world a terrible place to live in. \n\nThats it.Frankly, his statement is about as smarmy as you can get.  I'm quite surprised all of the justices signed it.\n\n>Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by the Chief Justice of the United States is exceedingly rare\n\nTestimony by any particular position is quite rare.  The only call someone in when there's a need for it, generally.\n\n>as one might expect in light of separation of powers concerns\n\nWhat powers does Congress have again?  Is it... Oh yeah, it is, it's *oversight*.  And the creation of new laws. Both things which would be well served by the testimony and which the heads of the judicial branch seem to believe they are above.\n\n>and the importance of preserving judicial independence\n\nAre you saying that a single judge merely giving testimony, answering some questions, for someone is enough to jeopardize the independence of the court? Well, it's a good thing you didn't go and do it then, the justices already have enough to worry about what with their undeclared gifts, income, and unreported sold houses, and celebrations with the federalist society.  Of course, maybe a few new laws to preserve \"judicial independence\" would help with those too, but you can't possibly endanger how \"independent\" you look to the Vanderbilt's and Carnegie's of the world, now can you.\n\nThis needs to stay in the news cycle and in the minds of our representatives until such a time that that invitation can be turned into a congressional subpoena.Perjury trap!They need to go and have all their verdicts tossed out.what a shocker... the highest court in the land that has the power to dictate our every living moment will not answer to ethics issues.This country is broke and I fear it can't won't fix itselfSo fuck us right? No democracy, no representation, no judicial review or checks and balances. Just as the founding fathers intended...wait.Is this what was intended by the saying *justice is blind?*  Asking for a countryWhat ethics? Were even ethics a concern to the supreme clowns?congratulation to Roberts for securing his legacy as holding one of the most corrupt Supreme Courts since the country's founding.CorruptThe optics at the Supreme Court is at an all time low and the Chief Justice is doing nothing to try and repair itHe doesn't want to lie under oathWell of course not. He knows how perjury works.That's pretty gross.  What use is a Chief Justice who won't speak up about the ethics of a Supreme Court Justice?  Where is the justice in that?Quick question... Can they cut funding to the Supreme Court? Congress has the purse strings. Can they say good luck getting paid or paying your staff or even keeping the lights on. Show up and testify, set up some internal processes that can be monitored and followed or good luck keeping the heat on.He\u2019s going to stick to subjects that he knows something about!Conservatives skirts ethics.  Shocking.TBF the Supreme Court is one of the three branches of government. They are in theory coequal and shouldn\u2019t put themselves under the jurisdiction of either of the other branches. So it is an awkward thing and sets a bad precedent if they did appear before Congress. That said\u2026 \n\nFUCK YOU. You have corrupted your institution and disgraced yourselves. The Supreme court needs to go back to its original role, which was much much weaker than what it is today. And there should be term limits for these would be dictators.So what do we do about it?\u201cWe enjoy being above the law too much. Now be silent, *PEASANTS!!!*\u201dThere are three co-equal branches of government. \nThe Supreme Court doesn't answer to congress or vice versa. The whole thing is more belly aching from the left. Congress has a sexual misconduct slush fund. 70 million has been paid out to \"victims.\" They should clean their own house.Too busy cashing the checks and watching the balances?We the people should vote for term limits for Congress, Senate, and the Supreme Court. By the when did we give up the right to vote on important issues and legislation that change our lives drastically? This is still a Democracy\u2026. Isn\u2019t it?Cool maybe we should just stop listening to their rulings tooconsent of the governed and all that good shitHad the same thought. I've always heard that this is Roberts court, Roberts is concerned about his legacy, Robert's will protect the courts legitimacy, Roberts has some ethics etc etc. \n\nGuess not.I honestly get his reluctance to do this.\n\nBut, given the ever diminishing respect the country has for the Supreme Court and Roberts' supposed concern for the integrity of the court I think he needs to step-up here.  Testifying before congress willingly does not break separation of powers.  He was asked, not ordered and he can speak if he wants.\n\nIn light of things getting worse than ever Roberts can try to be a leader and face the country or hide behind his robes.\n\nSo far, Roberts has not seemed up to the task.  History will not remember him well for it.Also: cool. Next time EYE get a jury summons **I\u2019m just not gonna go**. \n\n200 million can play that game, you corrupt douchecanoes \u270c\ufe0fShit yeah. Nothing to see here, move on buddy.  Or to quote Judge ~~Roberts~~  Dredd, \"I never broke the law, I AM THE LAW!\"above the law.Turns out Republicans are pussies. Oh wait we knew thatThis one isn't so straightforward, you wouldn't want to see the POTUS brought before Congress. But it's also clear members of his court have violated ethical standards set by Congress that it expects all government employees to adhere to. If Congress wants him to testify they should subpoena him, I suspect he would adhere to it because not adhering would likely cause a Constitutional crisis.\"I will not be testifying about ethics, as there is none for me to bring.\"Follow the money trail and it's a fair bet that the answer will be found. Thomas is not the only one that is sucking up the under the table benefits.If only they knew what honesty meant.I'm glad someone's being honest.\"Come and talk about our ethics? No need, turns out, we don't have any.\" - Roberts, probablyCan\u2019t speak on a subject they don\u2019t understand ?And about durbin. He's letting this happen. Every step of the way he's stalled any accountability. But more and more corruption comes out and the story won't die. So he just has to keep demonstrating the spinelessness of corporate demsCan\u2019t subpoena him with Feinstein on \u201cmedical leave\u201d.The top justice has no respect for the rule of law. I guess this means we can just ignore decisions from the Robert\u2019s court.who rules on whether or not a subpoena is enforceable? The Supreme Court. The endWhat we lack more than anything on the Democratic side is courage and integrity. AOC calls out more bullshit than any Congressmen as a relatively younger woman who has received the worst of threats and is a huge target. Fuck all the old white people in the DNC filling their pocketsThen what? He is the law and will just ignore it. lol.This the plan. If the court isn't credible, you cant sit on a two legged chair. You need all 3. They just missed getting 2 out of 3 branches, or  3-3 even... \n\nThis is why we have to go through this process. It is slow and agonizing. Now we have the special consul asking for the Fox documents concerning Jan 6. I truly hope the whole Federalist Society gets torn down as a subversive org.\n\nedit for the correct subversive group.Their power is that the constitution makes them a branch of government and that they have final say on legal opinions. Other lawyers and judges can\u2019t just be like \u201cI ignore you, I don\u2019t like your credibility.\u201dNo, you can't just ignore court decisions. Their power isn't just credibility, it's enshrined in law.The problem is this might have been the plan.  Look at the SCOTUS rulings that can be \"ignored\" that you would be happy with.He's banking that there will be no consequences. Which is a good bet, given all the evidence that has come before. One can only hope that at some point the most undemocratic body in American government will be deemed accountable by the others.No their power lies in the belief in the constitution.The Supreme Court's only real power is credibility with the police because the police enforce the laws. The police tend to be extremely right wing. So the Supreme Court still has a lot of credibility with the police.If you think Biden is strong enough to pull of a Jacksonian, \"John Roberts has made his decision, now let him enforce it,\" this is true.Yep. The one branch that is most immediately accountable to the people has taken deliberate steps to avoid making decisions, instead making the less accountable branches do it. It's absolutely shameful. They have no principles beyond securing their seats. They have no desire to legislate, because your voting record makes you vulnerable. The only things they'll pass are what their big money donors want because it helps them retain their seats.I mean, if you want to look at congress I don't exactly disagree, but I can't help but notice that congress has the same exact issue as the supreme court. No conservative in Congress or the supreme court can be trusted to honestly and faithfully carry out their duties. None. We can't entirely ignore the chief justice's anti-american corruption just because congress has failed to keep him in check.>  If you want to fix SCOTUS you have to fix Congress.\n\nThe question is: How?\n\nYou can fix Congress by ungerrymandering states. That won't fix the Senate you say, well, not directly, no. But states also have legislatures that are gerrymandered to hell and back. Those legislatures have passed laws making it harder to vote, disenfranchising democratic voters in their states. With free and fair elections in many currently Republican controlled states, democrats would stand a good chance of capturing Senate seats in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky and several others.\n\nAnd this would lead to Congress being able to fix itself and SCOTUS.\n\nBut how do you do away with gerrymandering? Fastest way, you gain control of SCOTUS. And that'll also help with campaign financing by the way. Lots of anti-democratic precedents have been set by this SCOTUS that could be overturned with a liberal majority.\n\nSo we're stuck in this circle of needing to fix Congress in order to fix SCOTUS and to fix SCOTUS in order to fix Congress. The saving grace might be the self-immolation of the Republican party under Trump and thus an opening for democrats to maintain control of the Senate and the Presidency for a little bit longer than we would normally expect - and seat enough Justices and/or create legislation to that effect that might help in that regard.I\u2019ll take this opportunity to once more scream:\n\n\u2605 ABOLISH \u2605 THE \u2605 SENATE \u2605\n\nWe could also severely weaken the Upper House, but I would really rather just *do away with it* altogether and expand the Lower House. \n\nJust the one House of Representatives, with twice or three times as many members (thusly representing a finer grain sampling of population, which would *hopefully* be more closely representational than it is currently).Thank you for this.This honestly kind of feels like a naive post.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, Congress does desperately need to be un-fucked. We're at a point that we hope the *EU* passes laws that will force multinational monopolies to do something that *might* trickle down to us, because our own government doesn't.\n\nBut you have to understand that we made the Supreme Court all-powerful. Congress cannot codify laws to unfuck things, because SCOTUS has the power to *remove the laws*. Half of how we've been fucked hasn't been just on changing court precedent on things that weren't put into law like Roe v Wade, it's been in the things that *were* made into law like parts of the ACA and the VRA.\n\nSo then the next claim is, well, then make it an amendment to the constitution. Completely ignoring that amendments are almost impossibly hard to pass, SCOTUS also has the power to redefine the constitution. The current interpretation of 2A, a centuries-old amendment, is just *15 years old*. The limitations of 1A are redefined regularly.\n\nThis is why Jefferson went to his grave lamenting the mistake they made by not challenging the authority the court took in Marbury v Madison.> Every bit of the problem with the Supreme Court today is just a symptom of the real problem- Congress. If you want to fix SCOTUS you have to fix Congress.\n\nA big part of what makes Congress ineffective is voting the opposing party from the President into the majority, particularly in the House. This is monumentally stupid and deadlocks the government because the majority party makes preventing the President from accomplishing his agenda their top 5 priorities. \n\nMost recently we're seeing grand standing in the House irt the debt ceiling. If there was a Democrat majority in the House, they'd pass legislation to raise the limit as requested by Biden with some concessions to get more moderate Senate Republicans onboard and we'd be done with it. \n\n>and they will not support any bill brought by the opposing party.\n\nThis just isn't true as a blanket statement. There are dozens of bipartisan bills passed every year. And the chips act passed the Senate 81-11.Unfortunately, it doesn't matter if Roe was codified into law by Congress. SCOTUS could have overturned the law just the same without a Constitutional Amendment.You aren't wrong in your analysis but it points to no feasible way forward because you cannot unfuck Congress without literally throwing out the Constitution. Equal representation in the Senate cannot be changed via amendment and that's just one of the reasons that no meaningful institutional reforms are possible through legal means.> Congress is paralyzed because Democrats and Republicans have effectively split the country 50/50, creating an impasse. They will not risk losing a seat on a divisive issue, and they will not support any bill brought by the opposing party. \n\nAh, good ol' BoThsIdEs!!1!Mind you, they didn't subpoena Roberts. They just asked him if he would come in to voluntarily answer questions. He's entirely within his rights to say \"no thanks\" to that.\n\nNow if the Senate subpoenas Roberts and he refuses to show up then that's a whole other story!It ain\u2019t right, but it is the belief that the SC is the judicial branch and should not have to answer to the legislative branch, even though they were voted in by said legislature.Just another reason why this country is falling apart. Everyone just does whatever the fuck they want now; no balance of power, no honor and no accountability.Think more carefully about this.  What court rulings would you *want* the states to defy?  The bad rulings don't tend to outlaw positive things, they tend to allow negative things.You would need a super majority in the minority controlled Senate to hold the Supreme Court justices accountable. There is no way to correct course.The US is a failed democracy.To be fair this is how the executive branch has been running the past 3+ decades (regardless of party affiliation). Can\u2019t blame the SCOTUS taking a shot at supreme power, I mean, it\u2019s in their fucking name. Did you never think it would not go to their heads?  Well now that they have an impenetrable political majority w/in, a spineless president and the same party in congress, they got NOTHING TO FEAR!Way to just turn your nose up at the American people and wield your power in the unhealthiest way.Not sure what there is to question. The court is prima facie illegitimate. The emperor has no clothes, and in fact he never did.Yea Roberts cries and cries and cries, until he falls asleep, knowing nobody takes him seriously\"I saw Sotomayor take home a pen from the office, we need an impeachment hearing now!\"Remember all the chants about \u201cactivist judges\u201d when they were ruling in a manner consistent with the law but not the way the right wing wanted? Now that there actually is a problematic supreme court (in rulings, ethics, and how they were selected i.e. denying Obama his appointment during the last year of his term yet Trump appointing one literally weeks before an election.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the right wing of politics and courts are a farce because they simply don\u2019t care about whether what they believe and tell others is true or not.You forget, they\u2019re in on the scam as well.So basically screw off we are following our ethics rules and its none of your businessThat was a big \"Fuck you\" in letter form.\n\nHis main reason for declining to appear is because past Justices haven't appeared.\n\nThat is it.  That is the legal wizardry he used.I have attached the ethics rules to which all current members of the Supreme Court subscribe^1\n\n^1 *as long you take their carefully crafted press statements at face value, and dig absolutely no deeper than that.*Are you sure that is from Chief Justice Roberts?  It shows Lindsay Graham's name under the signature.Letter from a dick to a Dick.The point of lifetime appointments is supposed to be a fearless adherence to justice even when it might be unpopular, so why is he such a fucking coward?Go ahead and add the majority of Congress to the list as wellAre whole system of checks and balances is a charade and far to much of it relies on the assumption that people will respect them and be honest most have no teeth.The check is the House and the Senate.\n\nNeither care enough to do anything.\n\nThe next check is at the next election, replace the House and Senate, and you can hold the SC accountable.They didn't subpoena Roberts so he's not required to show up.We have a system of toothless handshake agreements that everyone will just play by the rules with no way real way to enforce itTo dream. I don\u2019t think there are enough votes to impeach, much less to convict and remove any of the justices.Republicans control the House...> at every opportunity\n\nHow often are the media invited to question Justices about *anything*?Let\u2019s start with 67 senate votes, so not going to happen.Which is unconstitutional in the USProven to not work in an environment of political backing.Can\u2019t without a supermajority in both House and Senate and enough representatives to vote to impeach a Supreme Court Justice. I can\u2019t ever see that happening although I heartily agree with you.Even if the Democrats controlled the Senate they're not going to impeach Roberts for refusing to voluntarily come over for questions. If the Senate actually wants to FORCE Roberts to show up they need to subpoena him, otherwise he's well within his rights to say \"No thanks.\" (Whether that's a smart thing for him to do politically is another matter, but he wouldn't get impeached over declining an optional invitation.)How would you get all those constitutional amendments past?> Those old sad fucks thought the senate couldn\u2019t be corrupted\n\nThey did though - even after appointment a Justice can still be removed via impeachment.I don't see why any of that is relevant.\n\nTimes change.  There is a first time for everything including a first time a Justice needs to make some statements in front of Congress.So do you just dick ride for the parliamentarian procedure too.\nWhen  was the last time we had corrupt judges being bought and paid for.How are the other 3 corrupt?It already was conservative.  It turned stupid after the Republicans literally  stole one seats on the panel and then ignored all ethical concerns to put two more idiots on the bench.\n\nYes, it's ALL OF A SUDDEN corrupt....if by all of a sudden, you mean for the last six years.> And I'm pretty damn sure you have to be a lawyer in order to be a judge.\n\nYou are not correct.No actually there are no constitutional requirements to be a Supreme Court judge. You can literally pick a man off the street to be a judge. Similar to the speaker of the house. The speaker doesn\u2019t have to be a representative.> pretty damn sure\n\nNope.I don't follow. Thomas and Roberts are both horrible people, yesLegal, yes. Ethical, no. The Supreme Court (Thomas, Gorsuch and Roberts\u2026so far) have shown us that they are not ethical, do not abide by ethical guidelines and cannot be trusted.Lol good luck with that. We had a president lead an insurrection and he gets to run for president again 4 years laterIdk, it's not age. Geatz, DeSantis,  green, all are train wrexks too. It should be term limits, end lobbyists and corporate moneyEven putting that aside and talking as an organization head. At the moment there are serious, serious doubts regarding the corruption of the Supreme Court. Setting aside whatever considerations Roberts might have for 'institutional stability' or whatever his excuse is here, a responsible, ethical leader would want to go down there and talk about it.\n\nRoberts will not. And what that looks like from the outside is that the rumors are true and the SC as it is now has been selling American justice to the highest bidder. However bad exposure would be, it can't be worse than pretending nothing's going on.Dude is weakCan't really salvage his legitimacy, may as well keep lying about it?The only logical conclusion is that he wants this to be his legacy.That narrative worked for as long as it was supposed to work. We believed it just long enough, and now it doesn't matter because it's too late and we lost.There are checks and balances.  The senate should compel this fuck to testify on what the judicial branch is doing to combat corruption of lifetime appointees.  Any corrupt judge should be impeached or forced to resign.History will remember him fine, the way things are going his team will be writing it.We can't though, we're regular people. Laws only apply to us.Don't do that. Go, but make sure you know what jury nullification is. And absolutely don't tell anyone you do know about it until you're already neck deep into the case.[deleted]If there were credible accusations that the vice-president had taken bribes in office, I think the president would be obliged to at least comment on it, and if invited should probably testify. Specifically refusing to comment on these matters strikes me as an unethical and cowardly act\\*.\n\nLegally, of course, he isn't obliged to. He doesn't have to. But it *looks* like he's hiding something, even if he isn't. And that's potentially worse for the court than laying out what he knows.The Supreme Court are not congress' subordinates.\nThe regulatory power vested in Congress over the judiciary is not a plenary power. A code of ethics is a public policy matter that's up to SCOTUS' discretion.Sort of. Moreso: It'd be ethical to testify, so not showing up says all you need to know about their ethical compass.She needs to goSorry if this is a dumb question.. Why can\u2019t they without her?Feinstein and her ego bout to pull another RBGIs that a rule that can be suspended to gain a political advance that perhaps GOP has pulled in past to stick to the libs?lol america is such a jokeAnd the same fools that try to discredit her as being \u201ca bartender\u201d, have no trouble overlooking her education while lauding whackos like L Boebert, GED.He is neither the law nor the enforcement branch of the government. The SC needs to be reminded of these thingsNot if they send the referral to the DOJ to arrest him \n\nThat's two branches against one, exactly how this is supposed to work. Just like how when Congress subpoenas an Executive member, goes to court, and the court agrees that Congress has purview - 2 vs 1. Or if the court agrees with the executive against Congress - 2 vs 1.It he was the president, that could work, but his job is interpreting the law, not enforcement. If the DoJ comes knocking, he better fucking answer.They\u2019ve infiltrated power and won\u2019t be incriminating themselves, i figure.But they *don't* have 2/3. They keep suing and making these bullshit laws that get challenged in court because 1 judge can undo something much faster than 60 senators. The GOP would've just made a law banning abortion if they had the votes.They should've furthered this end by impeaching the corrupt ones while they had the House.Our failure is pretending that the fight is Republican vs Democrat, or conservative vs liberal, or even right vs wrong.\n\nThe capitalist party has 3/3 and is putting on a great big show of opposing themselves while chalking up win after win.I would be curious as to how the police could enforce their rulings also? They have no way to enforce any of their decisions. The police can not just walk up and arrest you for these decisions.[deleted]If we\u2019re ripping up the constitution, then just go all the way with a proportional parliamentary system and be done with winner-take-all two party bs.   Neither side\u2019s leaders want this because it weakens the extremes of both sides, so it won\u2019t happen in my lifetime.Weakening the Senate might be the only feasible way long-term. Hell freezes over before you get enough US Senators and enough states on board to abolish it entirely.\n\nHowever, if we take a look at the UK, their House of Lords technically still has the ability to reject legislation. But historically the Lords influence have shrunk down to a smaller size that they nowadays pass everything that comes from the House of Commons after some time of consideration.\nThe US Senate could develop into a similar direction, still maintaining their official, consitutional position and their duties, but effectively just be a rubber stamp to the business of the US House. However, for this to happen there needs to be a serious impass where the US Senate publicly shows their ineptitude for solving problems, where the House and the President just go ahead and strong-arm them into agreeing.\nAnother option is a long-term, gradual approach. But for that, politics need to be far less polarized than it is today. I don't see US Senators voluntarily giving up their leverage in todays political climate.>But you have to understand that we made the Supreme Court all-powerful. \n\nSCOTUS is not \"all powerful\". The branches were designed to be balanced. SCOTUS is beholden to the Constitution, which Congress writes, and the Justices can be seated or impeached by Congress. The branches are imbalanced only because Congress fails to use their powers.\n\n>Congress cannot codify laws to unfuck things, because SCOTUS has the power to *remove the laws*. \n\nSCOTUS can invalidate a law, in whole or in part, as unconstitutional. When they do so, it's typically with clear instructions on how the law can be changed to pass. IIRC, when they ruled on VRA,  they clearly explained that at issue was the section that targeted specific states for additional scrutiny. Meaning that Congress could have turned right around and rewritten it to apply to all 50 states and it likely would have stood.\n\n>So then the next claim is, well, then make it an amendment to the constitution. Completely ignoring that amendments are almost impossibly hard to pass, SCOTUS also has the power to redefine the constitution. \n\nThe point of my post is that it *shouldn't* be this hard. Amendments are a tool that we should be using far more than we do. The fact that partisanship makes that incredibly difficult is my entire point and it doesn't change that the power exists. \n\nSCOTUS only has the power to interpret, a power that is grossly magnified by the age and vagaries of certain sections of the Constitution. The Court could not vastly change the interpretation of the second amendment if its authors had bothered to write more than a sentence. Notice that modern amendments are longer, more clearly defined, and have rarely been the subject of such reinterpretation.\n\n>This is why Jefferson went to his grave lamenting the mistake they made by not challenging the authority the court took in Marbury v Madison.\n\nJefferson also stated that the Constitution ought to be rewritten every 20 years or so by a new generation. And several of the founders, including Adams and Washington, expressly feared what political parties might do to the country.It's a pretty well thought out post. The only thing in your reply that is an attempt to refute it is the comment about the ACA and VRA. \n\n\n\nYou pointed out yourself that the reason that abortion is now illegal in half the country is because congress *failed* to pass a law on abortion in the last 50 years. \n\n\nNo one is suggesting an amendment. \n\n\n\nCongress can expand the court. Congress can impeach the court. Congress can write new rules and impose new oversight. Congress has all the power and all the money. The justices don't show up a a building that appeared by itself to do a job that defines itself or get paid with money that comes out of thin air. It's all given to them by congress and they have no means to take anything that they are not given. \n\n\nYou say that \"we made the supreme court all powerful\".... well who exactly do you think \"we\" is in regards to a body that is not directly elected... that's right it's congress. The post you're replying to is not the one I'd say is being naive.They could have, but it would have been an even larger stretch.He's entirely within his rights but this is one of those instances where refusing to volunteer looks worse than just going along with it.\n\nThis hearing would've been nothing more than a farce at best, but now Roberts refusing to participate is the story.It is ***their*** belief that they should not have to answer to the legislative branch. Funny how that works.Life-long appointment.\n\nIn theory they could be removed by congress, but in reality this looks unlikely.\n\nIs there a word for a country in which Justices rule?\n\nBtw.: It kind of feel like these Justices will turn into \"Christian ayatollahs\".Branches are intended to be co-equal and the judiciary is defying the other two. Don\u2019t misplace the blame or remove their agency. The SC created this mess.What the fuck are you talking about lol do you even know what prima facie means? I need to bleach my eyes after looking at this threadHonestly this is the perfect time to do this, if one of the liberal justices would sacrifice herself and go on a vacation that\u2019s been funded by George Soros. The house republicans would shit themselves over this opportunity to impeach. The senate will never convict, but even if they do, democrats have the presidency and senate, and could cram through a replacement, ideally right before the election next year, ACB style. At any rate Republicans will have set a precedent on what kind of behavior they see as unethical for SC judges. Not like that will in any way shape their future behavior, as they\u2019re hypocritical bad-faith-actors. But \u2026 maybe it would matter to voters.Maybe, but so far the evidence only points one directionThey didn't subpoena him, they just asked him to voluntarily come in, so he's under no obligation to show up. No legal wizardry required, if the Senate wants to FORCE him to show up they need to subpoena him.His brilliant mind wrote a whole lot of words to say very littleThat\u2019s the sad truth and reality of the United States, corruption was legalized generations ago and the only mechanism to end that are in the hands of the corrupt.Times change but Roberts is totally within his rights to decline an optional request to show up. The Senate needs to actually subpoena someone to force them to appear, when they just say \"would you mind coming in\" then \"No thanks\" is a perfectly legal response.That\u2019s the question, really.\n\nI\u2019m beginning to feel the entire court is corrupt at this point, regardless of where the justice sits. \n\nI\u2019d love to be shown otherwise!It wasn't stolen. Sure love that word!I saw somebody else state that you didn't have to be a lawyer in order to be a judge. However I think he is a lawyer and him lying on the stand under oath will get him this barred.Yes.\n\nOur MSM is picking and choosing. Look into both/all!What you're saying makes more sense. \n\nWas just speaking out of frustration with our government. Sometimes I question how we are a world power despite our political circus.Roberts authored the concurrence on Citizens United that declared money the same as speech. So yeah this doesn't surprise me, if he gave a single shit about the institution itself he'd openly call for Thomas to resign. Fuck he'd still have his conservative majority and could probably convince Biden to nominate a squishy centrist who'd side with corporate interests anyways.They are trying their hardest not to admit they did or do anything wrong.  They are out of control and desperately need to be checked and balancedBulls eye, IMO. Well put.He already is saying by not saying anything,  there is corruption, but there is nothing you can do about it.I see it more as he believes he's above it-the questioning, the law- and how does anyone think he or any of them need to answer to others. It's a massive snub of actual JusticeWhat has concerned me the most has been a lack of infighting.  I'd expect serious turmoil if even one justice was ethically out of line on anything.  The fact that severa justices have serious, serious issues, and mum is the word throughout the Supreme Court, this speaks VOLUMES about the current state of the Supreme Court.  It's not just complacency here.  It's a racket.  All are involved and entirely ok with it.  THAT's the serious state of the Supreme Court these days.  It's effectively a joke now.  Tack on a highjacked Senate that will purposely NOT implement checks and balances on anything, and nearly all of the 3 branch government check and balance system is broken.  When Trump was in the executive branch, you effectively had a single ruling power with the then Democrat lead House going \"holy fuck holy fuck\" for several years.  The Republican party has made the place a garbage dump.Nah. They cannot repair. It\u2019s beyond that. It\u2019s been beyond that for some time.Indeed - the Supreme Court is the ultimate word on morals and ethics in many ways. Thus they should be trusted as moral and ethical people. These people make very heavy decisions, and there seem to be a few who lack those qualities.Sure\nIt\u2019s not worse\nIt\u2019s not better\n\nThis is new America \n\nThey do whatever the fuck they want and we just take it.Laws.  We need Democrat majorities in the house and senate if there is to be a chance of laws going into place to control a corrupt supreme court.He claimed to preside over the Senate trial of Trump yet refused to do anything to allow the introduction of evidence. I\u2019m pretty sure the founding fathers didn\u2019t write in the US Constitution that the head of the Supreme Court should serve as a simple figurehead during such a trial, but that\u2019s what he did.\n\nHe appears to have no backbone.Just like Kevin McCarthy.At this point I would do so much more damage on a jury, lmao. Those people want me to show up? I will literally shit myself in court. \n\nI will do everything I can to ruin the process as much at the bottom as they\u2019re ruining it at the top.> ~~No one~~ Only one party is above the law ~~or~~ and the law doesn't mean shit unless they point it at you.3 branches of gov't\n\nThey each are suppose to keep each other in check\n\nWhen one branch refuses to be checked, well that's a constitutional crisis.I know this isn't what r/politics wants to hear, but in that case impeachment would be the first step. Then you can obligate anyone to testify.  \n  \nThe system wasn't set up to work properly with a Congress that chooses not to function.I like your answer better lolThe egos on these people - like when RBG refused to retire when Obama when in office, and now because of her we have a MAGA SCOTUS....somewhere in a handbasket, at this point.She can\u2019t go without the votes to get her outBecause the subpoena would need to come from the judiciary committee. The Dems slim seat lead in the Senate gives them a one person lead in that committee. With Feinstein not there, the numbers are tied with the GOP and they\u2019re not going to vote for bringing Roberts in. It\u2019s the same reason that confirming judges had slowed to a glacial pace because they can\u2019t overrule procedural blocks from the GOP with a tie vote. \n\nFeinstein not being able to do her job had serious consequences and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s ACTUALLY on some sort of temporary medical leave which she\u2019ll come back from shortly. Whoever\u2019s making decisions on her behalf is causing serious harm.I believe she is on the committee that would do it and they need her vote? Not sure but that was my understanding from last time this was asked.[deleted]If th DOJ does nothing, then he is the law. If you don't hold violators accountable when they break laws, they are effectively the standard setters. A slippery slope straight into the deepest bowels of injustice.It was an invitation and you're recommending a sort of partial coup, it sounds like... \n\nI'm not a fan but he has valid reasons not to show up. If he were subpoena'd and rejected it's validity, even then he would still have some leg to stand on under separation of powers.If that's the route we're gonna go, we might as well just subpoena Clarence Thomas.\n\nAlthough he should testify, in the interest of government transparency, Roberts isn't really the ethical problem.>Not if they send the referral to the DOJ to arrest him \n>\n>That's two branches against one, exactly how this is supposed to work. Just like how when Congress subpoenas an Executive member, goes to court, and the court agrees that Congress has purview - 2 vs 1. Or if the court agrees with the executive against Congress - 2 vs 1.\n\nThe DOJ doesn't get to unilaterally enforce subpoenas.\n\nIf he were subpoenaed, he would move to quash that subpoena. Do you know who would adjudicate that motion? Federal judges.How many senators does it take to change a light bulb?\n\n...Just get used to the dark.>I would be curious as to how the police could enforce their rulings also? They have no way to enforce any of their decisions. The police can not just walk up and arrest you for these decisions.\n\nImagine the Supreme Court rules that being named Jerry is a violation of the Constitution and is against the law. Now imagine someone is named Jerry and they are outside and unarmed. A police officer -- if they wanted to -- is typically armed with a weapon and handcuffs. They could hear the Supreme Court's ruling, walk right up to Jerry, and arrest Jerry based on the Supreme Court's decisions.Uncap the fucking house.The amount of stretching isn't really a concern for this SCOTUS, given that they clearly understand our only recourse is to write mean things about them on the internet.Uhhh I mean it\u2019s a choice between grilled by adversarial congresspeople about his court\u2019s ethics violations on live tv and\u2026 not doing that? I\u2019m missing how a few headlines announcing that he said no could possibly be a worse option than consenting to an unscripted media event centered around how shit of a job he\u2019s doing.Defeund the SC. Pull 100% of their funding. Then, he'll show.actually that\u2019s literally the law soThey turned into cry babies when protesters congregate around their houses.>In theory they could be removed by congress, but in reality this looks unlikely.\n\nAnything that hasn't happened feels unlikely. It absolutely could though. It does feel like that's the viable path towards resolution.As if Republicans care about precedent.You assume that the right has standards that the followThat's the legalese for you.Spending a page saying \"This is *highly* irregular and thus I won't even consider the request.\" is insulting to everyone.\n\nI would have much rather he just said \"No.\" and left it at that.  If he was going to respond then he should have actually responded with some information that might make an appearance unnecessary.\n\nGoing \"Well I never!\" while fainting on a couch seems like a bad look to me, and if he is actually concerned about the honor of the court, refusing to talk about things rarely helps.You haven't shown how the 3 liberal judges are corrupt.Yes, it was.  You know it was and by what method so I won't bother debating with you.  You most likely say it wasn't stolen because you like the outcome.  Let us cut to the end of this thread and ghost the conversation so that we don't have to go through all that.I agree, it was our early manufacturing and adoption of technology, education and markets. You now have monopolies who block entry into markets and people who cut education funding. Result = people who believe in black magic fuckery and mirror dimensions (reference to TT BS), A shrinking middle class, and corporations screwing politicsAnd he \"earned\" his place on the Court by helping GWB steal the presidency in 2000. It's ridiculous that this country has ever pretended he is legit.If money is speech then so is violence.Iam so tired of these conservative Right GOP justices saying they are non political. We know they vote with their friends with money \ud83d\udcb5. Corporations &millionaires.Trial with no evidence. Overseen by the leader of the supreme court....The Senate sets its own rules for impeachment trials. The Constitution says only this: \n\n> The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\n\nThat's it. That's everything. So when they have a trial, they decide how it works. The Senate decides whether or not they'll allow evidence, not the presiding officer.Seems a trend of conservatism honestly.  Spinelessness and cowardiceGod bless youThis is the greatest comment I\u2019ve read this month.Then they\u2019ll throw you in jail for contempt of court and whatever else the judge wants to throw at you.If the Senate chooses to call witnesses. Which they didn't for Trump.Not happening with the current House, at least. I think legislative purposes is probably sufficient for subpoenas, given the data we do have.You mean when Democrats controlled the Senate. Obama nominated a Supreme Court justice in March 2016 and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell essentially told him to shove the Constitution up his butt hole.Have you heard of the name Merrick Garland?damn skippyShe can resign and retire. EasyYes she can\u2026 she can resign and then Schumer appoints a new dem to replace her. Schumer can\u2019t do that if she\u2019s still a sitting senator without the votes though.\"But what about her legacy!?!\"\n\nOr more likely \"but the next Senator won't keep us on as staff and even if they do, we don't get to be a de facto Senator\"Very informative, I appreciate it.Is she in a coma, i dont get this, stick her in a wheelchair all she needs to be able to do is say one word, yay or nayThey can simply reduce the committee size by 2 with a simple majority vote in the senate. They could also swap her to a different committee.\n\nThis is not an excuse.We don't need R's permission to see a replacement. The senate can do it with a simple majority vote.How can we take for granted how useless the Rs are?\n\nThese guys are complicit and enabling corruption every step of the wayThat is of course until Robert\u2019s own self dealing transgressions get aired as well.It sounds loose because it is but Roberts would help to publicly define the rules for SCJs so there is less ambiguity and the public is aware of Thomas\u2019s corruptness in contrast. \n\nHopefully it\u2019s not required to pursue but it\u2019s likely why Roberts is not playing ballDo we know what Robert\u2019s is up too?There are a whole lot of problems with what you just said. Probable cause... and a list of other issues, but ok.  How can you even verify if the person was actually that person?  I'm talking \"real world\" here.Also, you kinda prove my point. They have no way to enforce their decisions. Police enforce  local laws. The FBI would maybe have jurisdiction.  I'm not sure how that would work in real life either?r/UncapTheHouseHim not going is implicitly saying \"yeah, your worst suspicions are confirmed\". \n\nIt's the same as pleading the 5th when you're a defendant: the jury is *supposed* to abstain from holding it against you.Sure, the Republican-controlled House will get right on thatSo, here in the US, we have a system of checks and balances between the branches of our government, ensuring each is beholden to the others. In this case, justices can be impeached (like a President) and removed, even multiple times if need be (like a certain President).\n\nHow do you keep your country's Supreme Court from becoming corrupted?I mean, the history of ayatollahs being protested isn't that different... There are just a few iterations missing, including the morality police.But do you think a party that greatly benefits from these justices and praises them to their base as their achievements, would give that up in the nearer future?I see the concept of a hypothesis escapes you. \n\ni\u2019m making an educated guess based on what we are learning involving 1/3rd of the court so far. we can probably assume the other 3 right wing justices are corrupt - and i\u2019m wondering why shouldn\u2019t i assume the remain 3 justices aren\u2019t corrupt since there is no oversight.\n\nthis isn\u2019t rocket science.Yeah ghost, when you don't have an honest debate.We haven\u2019t. It just goes to show you how fucked things have gotten that Roberts has the most integrity of the 6 conservative justices.Kavanaugh and Barrett were also on GW's legal team, just FYI...what The monopoly of violence does to a MF (The government in this case)The country has? Or the oligarch-owned media that is backed by his owners has?Money can buy the later so yes, unfortunately.Money is violenceThe definition of preside in the Cambridge dictionary is \u201cto be in charge of or control a meeting or event.\u201d \n\nGiven the passage from the Constitution you cited and the precedence set by courts throughout the US, how you reached your conclusion that the Senate decides is unclear.And hate. Don't forget the hate.Cowardice? No. Blatant corruption. They do whatever their donors want.They're not chosen to govern, they're chosen to destroy government and to to be rubber-stamps for their donors.Generally,  people who openly fantasize about doing shit like this never actually would. But if they were one of the few people who would act on it, they probably know they're doing something illegal out in the open with a high chance of consequences. That's  kind of the whole point of civil disobedience.Hence, subpoena him and force him to reject. I suspect you get a Justice who shows up to the committee and none of his responses are sufficient because the best response he could give is \"we expect justices to self police.\" I actually think the most productive hearing would be one held in private without the cameras. Roberts knows this is a stain on his court & I suspect he would like to course correct.\n  \nI know it's really unfulfilling, but like I said above our system of government wasn't designed to function where half of Congress won't fulfill its oath to the constitution.Obama should have done a recess appointment told McConnell to suck it.Yes..that\u2019s what I said. Without the votes.At this point I wouldn't be surprised if she were a vegetable or dead.  Literally no comment for months!I think she's experience dementia? So it's not even like you can trust her to say the word or even understand what she's saying it to. She isn't fit to serve any longer and needs to resign.She is literally MIA with dementia, but still an active US senator.\n\nSays a lot about our current system.Without Feinstein, they don't have enough for a simple majority vote. Kyrsten Sinema defected from the party at the prospect of 51 Dems, remember? And it's not like Joe Manchin is a reliable vote.I heard somewhere the seating process is done via resolution which is subject to filibuster. So 60 votes unless the rules were changed.Soooo if Roberts asked you for PR advice you\u2019d recommend he testify here?No. Of course not. But tides can shift. I'm by no means calling it likely. Just the viable path towards resolution. Right now it does certainly seem unlikely. But there is still hope that the voter base will rectify these problems. Odds aren't great, but it is still plausible.\n\nThe greater point though is that impeachment does look like the viable resolution, so as difficult as it may be it should still be pursued. If there's an available path that could possibly win you take it over others that can't.So you're going to make stuff up and assume? Facts be damned. Critical thinking escapes you.....There is no debate, dumbass, the seat was stolen - there is no way that you can argue that it wasn't.  If you want to try to persuade me that something that is prima facia, then you go right ahead.  I will enjoy watching you make a fool of yourself.\n\nGo for it froggie.He doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s just the brand image that he has cultivated. It\u2019s bullshit. Stop falling for it. He\u2019s just as bad as all the others.Someday the history books will look at 2000 as where things went off the rails (hopefully only \u201cfor a little while before they got back on track\u201d and not \u201cleading into the \u2018American Troubles\u2019 \u201c).Chief Justice Rehnquist (who presided over President Clinton's impeachment trial) wrote pretty famously about this.   The Constitution only says the Chief Justice *presides* over the hearing, it does not grant him any actual power.   The impeachment trial is conducted *by* the Senate, per the Senate's rules -- and the Constitution further says that the Senate is the *sole* entity in control of its own rules.\n\nThat reduces the Chief Justice's role over the proceedings to an entirely ministerial role; limited to enforcing the rules that the Senate themselves set.   If he *does* act beyond that (as technically anything the rules don't speak to, he can order on), the Senate can, at any time it wants and with a simple majority vote, amend its rules in order to override whatever decision he makes, since the rules are supreme.\n\nThis effectively means a majority of the Senate runs the show, and the Chief Justice is reduced to basically just banging the gavel.  Or, as Rehnquist put it, his job was to \"do nothing in particular and do it very well\".>Roberts knows this is a stain on his court & I suspect he would like to course correct.\n\nIncredibly naive of you. You think he cares about his *legacy*? *Really*??? Where the fuck have you been?Everyone was far too confident in an HRC win (including myself). He figured it wouldn\u2019t be worth making it into a major issue ahead of the election. Outrageous miscalculation, but it didn\u2019t seem crazy at the time..frustrating, but no crazy. \n\nNow we know.[deleted]Except the Senate never officially goes on Recess. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Obama forcibly declaring a Recess, which would be an interesting developmentIts an insane situationFirst thing I'd recommend is interpreting the law fairly.No, that's the worst part, he literally does, it's obvious in the history of his written decisions. It's just that we're comparing epsilon to zero.More like the Reagan presidency than 2000, imoExcept that's literally not what the word \"preside\" means. \n\n>be in the position of authority in a meeting or other gathering.\n\nIt has never meant anything else. There is no clever mincing of words Republicans can point to, like the bullshit they try with 'well-regulated' regarding the 2nd Amendment. If you preside over something, you have authority over it. Period.\n\nSorry that Rehnquist was a bad faith troll and you fell for it, though.Rehnquist decided how he was going to handle the Clinton impeachment trial.  Since he was the one presiding over it, he could choose how he thought it should be run and did so.\n\nRoberts was under no obligation to follow Rehnquist. \n\nRegarding\n> )\u201d. . . the Senate can, at any time it wants and with a simple majority vote, amend its rules in order to override whatever decision he makes, since the rules are supreme,\u201d\n\nfrom where does this originate?  Colloquially, if I say that someone should preside over and is therefore \u201cin charge\u201d of a meeting, that person gets to set the agenda and rules for the meeting. It doesn\u2019t mean that other participants in the meeting can overrule the person presiding.Naive? No, I strongly disagree with him on much, but of the conservative justices he has consistently tried to make rulings as narrow as possible & to not undue precedent wherever possible. I do think he cares about the legacy of the court.I had no confidence.I blame the Chicago cubs winning the world series.. they broke the time space continuum and flung us into buzzaro landMany of the same people \"tired of having to vote for the lesser of two evils\" are also raging at the consequences of people not showing up to \"vote for the lesser of two evils.\"\n\nNot voting or voting for some third-party polling at 2% only makes the system worse.And now we know, always act like you're going to lose next election cycle *because you never know what's going to happen*.Well I\u2019m sure you know a lot more about that than he does, so fair enoughI don't see what evidence there is that he cares about his legacy. You don't present any.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n[Harvard Law Professor Argues That The Supreme Court No Longer Cares About Its Own 'Legitimacy.'](https://abovethelaw.com/2022/08/harvard-law-professor-argues-that-the-supreme-court-no-longer-cares-about-its-own-legitimacy-what-now/)  \n\n\n>In the Dobbs opinion, Justice Alito explicitly said, it\u2019s not our job to care about public opinion. We shouldn\u2019t take that into consideration at all.  \nBut I think what the Court is realizing, especially in the last few weeks, is, if you do not care about public opinion, and you do something that\u2019s extremely controversial, you risk the public turning on you. And eventually at some point, if you anger enough people, the public will stop listening and start doing something to reform your power.  \nI think two big points stem from this. The first is that I doubt it\u2019s a coincidence that the Court\u2019s handwaving of legitimacy coincides with historically low approval ratings.I thought she would win up until after she won the primary. Her strategy in the general was dumb as hell. Democrats need to stop trying to win elections by metrics that have no impact on who actually wins.\n\nThe US president has never been chosen by the popular vote, EVER. Democrats need to stop acting like the popular vote matters, it should, but it fucking doesn't. Win the Electoral College, the thing with the people with the actual voting power.Hilary was very polarizing for a majority of moderate voters.Yup.  No one wants HRC.  The DNC could have run literally anyone else and they would have beat Trump.  Literally anyone.  The writing was on the wall and the DNC heads screwed the Dems with pushing for her instead of Bernie.  Then the Dems screwed themselves when they had both chambers and the executive branch during a few years under Obama.  The moment things started to go south is when Pelosi should have been smart enough to shore up rights and pushed things through.Nah man, Harambe was the only thing holding reality together. If he had lived then the cubs and trump would have lostIt all makes sense now.That's Alito. Alito is a miserable SOB. Roberts was the only conservative advocating for anything besides a complete undoing of Dobbs. He continually pushed for the middle ground.  \n  \nI'm not defending Alito, I find his conclusions often wrapped in politics. Take the abortion drug ruling in TX, he was one of the justices to dissent, but it's obvious to a first year law student that the people who filed the lawsuit had no standing.Yeah. When she was selected At the convention i shook my head and said out loud \"Trump is going to he president\" then I hot chills and felt sick and tried to pretend that was really for 4 monthsShe could have used her VP pick to endear people to her and make a statement that she cared, but instead she picked someone super boring that no one knew that she very transparently owed a favor and it just drove home everything we already hated about her.",

And I hate Ted Cruz.\"\n\nOf course it was a lie, of course they had no evidence.\n\nIt's the GOP after all.They were asking for evidence and were never provided evidence.\n\nOver 2.5 years later there is still no evidence.It\u2019s so weird that in America you can just lie about stuff like this on a show with \u201cnews\u201d in the name.\n\nYour bourbon *must* be made in Kentucky, but your news can be wall to wall lies. Wild.Did Cruz tried checking inside of Trump's ass because that's here he was pulling claims of voter fraud fromEat a bag of limp ones, Ted.It\u2019s crazy this is still even being discussed.

Now how do we rid ourselves of this loser. How do we kick him out of officeGOP and conservative reaction: we only want to talk about hunter biden's dick picsI am sure they would have...if there had been any.Raphael Cruz is a traitor.If Ted wants to see fraud he should take a look in the mirror.Ted Cruz is a hacks hack. The truest hack of them all. He's the embodiment of selling out when it was considered a bad thing to do so.There was none!I think he was telling them they need evidence if they take it court. Am I not understanding? I don't see why this is a big deal.Twitter has declared this a massive gotcha and the end of Cruz' career but it's kind of a nothing burger? \n\nOr am I missing something very obvious?I\u2019m sure he did.I feel like showers are a really good analogy for what this is trying to refer to. Like when you get done cleaning yourself and removing all the dirt but you're not wet. Prove to me you took a shower if you don't have any water on you at this moment.Facists being facist?

GOOD FUCKING GOD.I wonder what recent FOX employee might be spiteful enough to have held onto this recording and release it once only recently.She cruz on my ted til i cancunYou can see who he really is behind closed doors. That makes his behavior even more insufferable because it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s playing a character.\n\nIf we didn\u2019t have bad faith actors, we\u2019d have nothing at all.Why hasn\u2019t Ted been arrested yet?\n\nIf a tape came out showing that I had knowingly tried to overthrow the legitimate government of the United States and install a puppet government, I would have been in jail within hours.You would think that they could have easily shown him some kind of fraud that would have made a difference, especially since Trump has said that he had massive voter fraud evidence.Oh, the na\u00efvet\u00e9 on this one.  He truly believed.  I bet his Santa Claus letters were heartbreakingly honest.And they did. They put his face on their shows, right? No bigger fraud (arguably) currently serving\u2026He knew. Still didn't bother him to contest the certification of the votes **after** the insurrection.That was so fucking cringey too. The way he and the men around him had pre-planed to all stand and rise at a specific part of the objection for added theatre.Joe Biden IS the President!Maury,  the lie look jus like him. How he gonna deny it Maury. IT look jus like him.Or as Lindsay Graham said:\n\n>\"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.\"My Pillow guy is still preparing the documents.Bourbon can be made anywhere in America, not just Kentucky.Duh? Can't you connect the dots? Fox News, the biggest and most powerful conservative media purveyor of the election fraud narrative, only backed down in court because they were in on the fraud the whole time. They played the key role in the conspiracy of large media conglomerate who will needlessly alert everyone to the existence of the conspiracy, but ultimately back down. And Fox paid $800,000,000 to fill this self-defeating illogical role in the plot.\n\nPaYiN aTtEnTiOn YeT?Only.massive dumps they'll get is if they swing by my place in bout an hrDo these people actually believe in the conspiracy, or is it a head in the sand reaction to Democrats exposing and explaining Russian election interface.\n\n\nLike flipping the board game when you lose all the good piecesI don't see what Wallabies have done to deserve that?He hasn't denied it.Wouldn't even be the worst thing his doneIndeed. MSNBC did a *really* good takedown of Cruz today based on recordings leaked hours ago and it's not even on their own website yet. \n\nBig if true, I await further confirmation, myself.\n\nEdit: link to the article.\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/hear-ted-cruz-caught-on-tape-plotting-step-two-of-jan-6-coup-171324485510I swear Hunter Bidens dick is the wallpaper on most republicans cell phones.Because Ted Cruz was Ivy League educated, the Solicitor General of Texas for five years, and an overall smart man who is very familiar with the basics of the law in this country.  He is on tape telling someone explicitly that they are going to need to provide actual evidence of voter fraud to succeed in the court system.  Now since that evidence never existed in the first place, and therefore was never shown to Ted Cruz, it then makes you wonder why the Senator, along with Josh Hawley, were the two people from the Senate side who spearheaded the campaign to de-certify the election results on 1/6.\n\nI'd say that's a big deal.Me neither.I mean, don\u2019t use Twitter or hold it up as an accurate measure of anything, but it\u2019s evidence that Cruz, like Fox News, didn\u2019t believe in the Big Lie and pushed it anyway.\n\nNot an end for him in Texas, but more proof that he\u2019s a loser.Everything is a nothing burger apparently. \n\nThat is until you are sued into the ground.We don\u2019t hold republicans accountable.Ludovico Technique.AgreedLindsay graham has not said many funny things but damn if that wasn\u2019t a line up there with \u201cif I was your husband madam, I\u2019d drink it\u201dOfdonald Graham you mean?Yea 5 million documents to be transferred to that guy who disproved his election fraud \u201cevidence\u201dSidney Powell and the Kraken\n\n\nNever forget~~Right but it can\u2019t be called bourbon unless it\u2019s made in Kentucky~~\n\nWell apparently this simply isn\u2019t true.Lol my conspiracy brain-washed buddy actually went off about BlackRock and Vanguard - implying that the $787M was just going from the left pocket to the right pocket.\n\nExcept dominion is owned by an unrelated private equity firm - and the murdochs are far and away the majority shareholders of Fox News Corp?\n\nThe goalposts will literally never stop moving - they just can\u2019t admit they were wrongAsking 2 hours later; So, How was it?  Satisfying?  One for the blog? :)I would like to apologize to all wallabies.I know he objected to them certifying it until they could look into it. Was he part of the fake elector scheme? The way it came off to me was that he wanted to make sure that there was no fraud. I've no doubt he was disingenuous and knew that the whole election fraud was BS. But I expect that from Republicans these days.Yeah, this is more evidence of his shittiness but we already knew thatWhat's the crime here? That he is a lying traitor to America?\n\nNews flash, we already knew this.Graham is surprisingly funny at times, and even shows some decent insight about various things.  This leads me to believe he's probably kind of intelligent.\n\nThe problem though is that he lacks any kind of integrity or dignity to use that intelligence for anything useful.The kraken is hiding on Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop.The Kraken Kroaked.If its not from Kentucky then it's just sparkling moonshine.There are several requirements to be called bourbon.  Location luckily isn't one of them.Well that's just not true.\n\nMost of our bourbon is produced in Kentucky but is also produced in other states as well.Yep my Q buddy just shared that with me 30 mins ago. He\u2019s been silent since I told him Dominion Resources is not related to Dominion Voting. \n\nThey had to come up with some sort of way to explain the loss in court and firing of their hero Tucker. Only took a few sentences on a meme to convince them to spread the \u2018inside job\u2019 narrative. What else is new.It really is just that\u2026. All of these people are too hard headed to admit they were wrong about Trump and everything else they\u2019ve made their whole existence about.I've been arrested for bio terrorism, attacks on public infrastructure, as well as various crimes against humanity, and legally cannot discuss further>I know he objected to them certifying it until they could look into it. Was he part of the fake elector scheme? The way it came off to me was that he wanted to make sure that there was no fraud.\n\nHere's the thing... as pointed out above Cruz is highly educated and knows what the law says. \n\nThe controlling interest with respect to this is the Electoral Count Act.... Cruz is well aware of this. \n\nUnder the Act, specifically 3 USC 15 in statute, the date of the count is set to be explicitly Jan 6th.\n\nThat's also the Code that defines how the Congress split for debate, with a written objection signed by one Representative and co-signed by one Senator. \n\nOn a side note I'm not exactly sure how long ago the last time Congress had to split to vote was but this is a very, very rare event. \n\nAny debate itself is covered by 3 USC 17, which limits the time for each speaker and the overall time for the debate. It also requires each chamber to make this the sole course of business in Congress for actions on the Floor. \n\nThe final important bit is 3 USC 16 which mandates that the joint session may not be dissolved until the counting process is complete, that act recess should be related to the counting (though there is a \"or what each chamber decides counts\" loophole here) and may only last till 10am the following calendar day (the congressional day remaining Jan 6th in this case due to no adjournment and skipping Sunday) ... and that recesses may only continue for 5 calendar days (excluding Sunday).\n\nIt's important to keep this in mind when the likes of Ted Cruz were calling for a 10 day recess or adjournment... he's sufficiently educated to know that is explicitly in violation of the US Code. \n\nAlso just for a moment reflect on the insanity of asking for this... how long did Arizona take to do that Cyber Ninja audit of just Maricopa County? Is it in any way reasonable to even consider an audit of the US election over multiple States to be carried out within 10 days... there's a good reason that they're is a safe harbour deadline for legal activities to wrap up and strict timelines for the States to officially sign off their certification and transmit their certificates of ascertainment to the relevant places. \n\nAs for whether he was involved in this... he was the person who countersigned the Arizona written objection. I'd argue this was in violation of his oath of office considering that his objection was based on nothing in reality, and his ask was in violation of the statutes governing the electoral process (and arguably thus unconstitutional).\n\nCruz was in the scheme to overthrow the election up to his neck... as culpable as Jim Jordan...[deleted]I think this is one of those things that won't move conservatives and will just be added validation for left/liberals.Correction, le Kraken IS Hunter Biden's laptop!KentuckilyWell shit! A little Googling proves you right. That\u2019s one pervasive falsehood!Must have been a hell of a curry.Sinker or floater? I got a 100 word essay I need to turn in asap.Awesome.

But it is unreasonable to ignore the increased risks that come from having an octogenarian in the Oval Office.It matters though.He wasn't in my top five Dem candidates last time. But he's been a pleasant surprise. Not without some serious disappointments, but that's life. Sounds like he's assembling an excellent team \u2013 and Sanders has already removed himself from the potential for distraction, which is huge. Game on. Go Joe!Absolutely not. Will I vote for him over any republican? Absolutely. Should we stop putting geriatrics in office? Fucking right we should, at some point you need implement age caps on political positions. You need to be 35 to run but there are much smarter 30 year Olds than 70 year olds who have a higher probability of dying in office.\n\nIf you want change you need to voice it loudly and frequently. I will not 'Get over it'.Not gonna lie, I'm gettin' some serious \"Back to your corner, serfs!\" vibes from this article.I voted for Biden. That being said,\n\nMy friends who work in immigration law have been shocked and devastated by his administration. Despite the campaign rhetoric, they\u2019ve governed quite similarly to the Trump administration on these issues.\n\nMy friends who work with the environment share a similar dismay. Despite the better rhetoric, the Biden administration is absolutely failing us regarding the ticking time bomb of climate catastrophe.\n\nHis administration\u2019s actions regarding labor unions, such as the railroad workers unions, have been surprisingly anti-worker, again despite the campaign promises.\n\nRecently, the Biden Administration requested the largest pentagon budget in American history, and has consistently overseen massive increases to our military spending.\n\nI\u2019ll vote for him again if I have to, but there are very legitimate criticisms of this administration. Advocates for the working class, the environment, immigrant rights groups, and critics of the US military industrial complex all share deep disappointment with what he\u2019s done.\n\nArticles like this that scold democratic voters for voicing their concerns are not helping improve the discourse. You\u2019re allowed to express concerns about the Biden/Harris ticket without being ageist, sexist, and racist for doing so.I had a gal I work with go off on a tangent about how Biden is too old and how Trump should be president cause they need someone younger. I pointed out how Trump is still old himself and only younger by 3-4 years. She was all \u201cbut it\u2019s only by 3-4 years\u201d. I responded with \u201cthat\u2019s just it, *only by a few years* \u201c\n\nI seriously can\u2019t even with the logic of these people.No. I'm a democrat and no I won't get over our leaders being ancient no matter how many condescending headlines get paid forThere are only two people in the United States it seems . Joe Biden and Donald Trump lol \ud83d\ude02.I will not get over the fact that our entire government is run by ancient, decrepit old crypt keepers who, while one foot is in the grave, are making decisions to define a world in which they will not live. Therefore, they see no problem with (for example) enriching and re-electing themselves on donations from fossil fuel companies even as those companies demonstrably and provably destroy the Earth. They won\u2019t have to live in a world stricken with full-blown climate catastrophe, so why should they care?\n\nGo fuck yourself with your neoliberal propaganda. Joe Biden shouldn\u2019t be in charge and neither should Trump. Age limits on public office, NOW.No. There's a reason we have a retirement age. Old people with no real skin in the game shouldn't be running anything, especially in an age where the best description of the internet Congress could come up with is \"a series of tubes.\"We need mandatory retirement ages for President,  Congress, Supreme Court, and Federal Judges.\n\n72 is old enough for an elected official or judge.JFC, since he formally announced he is running again half of the damn posts in here are like this.\n\nThe astroturfing is coming from inside the house!I\u2019ll vote for him again but I\u2019m still gonna be annoyed that we don\u2019t have anyone younger and more progressive (and god forbid not an old white dude). Sigh.Stop dick ridingIt\u2019s a fair concern and criticism. Get over it.I mean, what choice do we have?\n\nBut there\u2019s a realistic chance he pulls an RBG/Feinstein by dying or becoming incapacitated during the campaign and inadvertently screwing the country in a major way just because he\u2019s infected with \u201cI alone\u201d disease.\n\nCannot wait for this gerontocracy to go.[removed]Dianne Feinstein is old. Get over it.And, Dianne Feinstein is old too; get over that as well.We are going into a Presidential Primary where the two top contenders are not going to debate.  This is a dangerous precedent...Seriously, news has nothing else to cover or create controversy with. We ve already seen him do better than younger presidents before him.Until we do away with the two party voting system, unfortunately, our options are old Fascist or old corporate Capitalist. \n\nThey\u2019re both shit choices, but one is diarrhea being fed to you through a fan and one has been battered and deep fried.Both of them if they worked in the private sector would have been moved into retirement,the executive with a gold watch,the real worker with an award known as the DCM,or don\u2019t come Monday.Why are judges and politicians allowed to descend into senility still on the job.I am a boomer and I know I am a dinosaur,out of touch with modern culture and attitudes,why are these pale stale males still trying to rule the world they no longer understand?He\u2019s too damn old. This is not a good ideaSure Biden is old but he sucks as hard as a politician half his age.Where can I get my *Dark Brandon '24* bumper stickers?...and unlike Trump, Biden actually is in remarkably good health for someone his age.Old > NazisJoe Biden is old but he\u2019s doing a great job. I praying newsom or oscroff run in 2028. Hell, man I\u2019d vote for anyone with D behind their name. This country won\u2019t survive 4 more years of that orange turd.Out with the old. He's only got my support for lack of better alternatives.That argument makes no sense coming from Republicans.  They are both old as shit, but only one is pro Russia.  I grew up in the 80s, Russias always been the enemy.Stop putting these old fucks back in office.Joe Biden is an establishment politician who is scared to rock the boat of status quo.The last time I check, he was doing better than many  40-year-old men. There goes  the hypocrisy of American individualism.Even if the narrative of Biden passing the torch is necessary, he should do it after using the office of the president to win re-election. Any other suggestion of Democrats is super dumb.It\u2019s obvious Trump has never been qualified for anything, age or not. But, the best the Democrats can come up with is an 80 year old? This isn\u2019t normal. He should be happily retired and enjoying the few years he has left, but apparently there is nobody in the Democratic Party can match him. What has the party being doing all these years that they have been incapable of bringing up some leadership with vitality? I\u2019m 67, so not exactly young, but Biden seems like a piece of stale white bread to me.NoYeah I know. \n\nStill supporting him over anything the GOP can come up withThey are all too old. Need to stop letting old men run for he presidency when we have retirement ages for every other job.This argument is old. Get over it.Too oldNo. I should never have to stress about our president living out his term due to age.really, this is the response to any question regarding bidens age? cool cool democracy!No, I won\u2019t get over it. People this old should be relaxing and enjoying their final years, not running the fucking country.No.Ah neat. Here comes the massive waves of neolib propaganda lol.No. Cos if he dies in office, Harris becomes President and that\u2019s not who I want leading the country.  Old people need to learn to hand over the torch. They certainly should not be running a country at 83 years old.  \n\nI kindly suggest the writer of the article get over the fact that people don\u2019t want Boomers in power anymore.I have.\n\nHappily, gonna vote for Joe and Harris in 2024. AND happily, gonna vote for local and state positions and laws in my area.This whole thing is missing the forest for the trees. Biden is an example of a problem, but a much smaller example of the problem since the presidency is essentially the pentacle of any American Politicians career. The problem is, boomers who have hogged leadership positions for decades have left GenX and even Millenials with a skill gap. This is not exclusive to politics, but in business too. Boomers hogging leadership and roles for so damn long has caused a backlog of younger people who didn\u2019t get into those positions to start developing themselves. A really good example is Diane Feinstein. Her position right now could be occupied by a younger democrat to develop them and cut their teeth on the national stage, being a potential future presidential candidate. Many of the multi-generational politicians who have held their same seat for decades have denied to opportunity of younger people to develop themselves in politics. On the Republican side, Chuck Grassley.\n\nThe repercussions are not enough GenXers, as an example, who got to cut their teeth and develop themselves like the boomers. Gen Cers are gonna be thrusted in a short window to govern and no one from the Gen X generation is gonna know how the hell to govern because many of them didn\u2019t get a opportunity to until way later in life. When finally death denies Boomers from their beloved seats.I don't love Biden running, but the Democrats must not have any other candidates they really like at this point.They\u2019re both ancient. We deserve better. But we\u2019re still eating dogshitMy grandma is 102, sharp as a tack.You ask us to \u201cget over it\u201d but he\u2019s obviously on the decline. Not saying he shouldn\u2019t run, as there isn\u2019t really an alternative atm, but it\u2019s silly to suggest that his age isn\u2019t effecting his abilities (or even detrimental)I don\u2019t have a problem with old people.  I have a problem when his wife has to usher him away from the press because he looks like a lost puppy.  Is he mentally competent?  Probably but I\u2019ve seen enough to have valid questions about it.Wishful thinking.  He's not the same guy who pwned Ryan in 2012, and no amount of finger-wagging's going to change that.  He shouldn't be running again.Old isn\u2019t the problem, obviously senile is.[deleted]Everybody older than me is \"old\", all that matters is can the person do they job they're running for and do I think they'll do better than the other viable candidates.Done.Biden is old. But the reason you complain about people being old is because they are less capable in some way.\n\nWhich in Biden's case, they could complain about his speech, or his memory, or whatever. But they don't, because it just doesn't stick.\n\nSo they complain about his age, because it resonates with young progressives who want a young progressive, and conservatives who think anything is worth denying Biden over. \n\nThey complain about his age, and his son, because they have no legitimate complaint over the man himself.For the oldest person ever to hold the office, I\u2019m astounded that instead of assessing his performance based upon his accomplishments thus far, the overwhelming focus is on his chronological age. I think both he and his predecessor (and heck, the ones before that as well!) deserve that judgment separate from a discussion about their age.Yeah Biden is too old, but I'm not going to hear shit about it from the devotees of a guy just a few years younger who sounds at least as inarticulateMy problem is President Harris.Not going to get over it. \n\nHaving a real possibility that a president may not make it through his term in this political environment is insane. \nMost don\u2019t know/like/care about Harris and if GOP wanted to stage a coup there would be no better time.Dems continue to be their own worst enemies. If Bloatboy were 125 yo, his maga disciples would still be worshiping his holy name and fabricating legends of his prowess. That's how they win.No, he should not be runningGovernment employees should be forced to retire at the retirement age of all citizens.  He may have life experience but he\u2019s out of touch with reality.Anyone over 70 is too old. Thank you, Biden, for your service.What will you do if I don\u2019t get over it lol? It doesn\u2019t affect my vote either way. I\u2019ve won my spot on the ark with my vote (which is clearly the only worth someone has in these times, we\u2019re all equally worthy or worthless by this metric unless you\u2019re rich) I\u2019ll make as much noise as I want\n\nWrite a letter to your senator to be thrown in the recycling bin if it bothers you.Yeah but at least he\u2019s he is sane!Sad state of affairs. American politics is just black and whiteI don't give a shit that he's old. I give a shit that he broke a union when all they wanted was to be treated like human beings. He's a capitalist monster, just like all the rest.How old is Joe Biden?\n\nJoe Biden is so old, he fell of his Wooly Mammoth and broke Hunter\u2019s wooden laptopOld is not the problem, senile is.I would rather we not be governed exclusively by old white, straight, Christian men. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not capable of the job, they just don\u2019t like to rock the boat, and we need someone willing to capsize it.He's not running with Harris, is he?Yeah, that pretty much sums it up.  Still better than the alternative.  Harris could be even better than Biden anyway for all we know.Problem is not as much his age as his being uninspiring...he had no coattail in 2020, lost the house in 2002...if the GOP get their acts together and nominate someone else than Trump, I am afraid for the USA...DoneI don\u2019t care how old these guys are. I just don\u2019t think Biden or Trump is what the US needs right now. Haven\u2019t we had enough division by now? Let\u2019s put someone in office that can at least unite us, or come close to it.Why are we electing any person this old?Thanks for the failing gerontocracy, boomers!Tru p. Is a idiotHonestly, I'd vote for a literal dementia patient before I'd vote for Trump. I don't care how \"sleepy\" Joe is; at this point, I'll vote for anyone other than a republican/conservative. I'm tired of seeing human rights eroded away in my (red) state. I'm sure as hell not gonna vote for more of it at the national level.Biden has done a perfectly fine job as president. He has driven our nation onto a level course and generally positive forward direction. His age is not a problem... yet. \n\nI am still disappointed that there is no one in their 40s that could be the face of this movement to keep it going and to also have the insight of growing up in a more recent generation.I'm voting for Biden's administration.  Biden's age doesn't matter to me because I think a president's cabinet and White House personnel matter more and I trust him more than any Republican to choose those people.Seriously. I'm so tired of the countless \"I think Biden has been a good president, but he's too old!\" pearl-clutching comments on here. He's been the most productive president legislatively in decades, and has been on top of foreign policy. He's surrounded himself with fairly competent officials and staff. \n\nClearly his age isn't a big issue hindering him at all if he's still been a good president so far. It is a shallow critique, and if anything, it just means we should be analyzing his VP choice more, not him as a candidate.Yep. Unless your system changes and starts to put age limits. This will just happen again and again.I don't think age is the defining point  when discussing performance.  Different people age  well some not so much..  we are at the latter \ud83d\udcaf>I think that I just feel like a young man. I\u2019m so young! I\u2019m the youngest person. I am a young, vibrant man.\n\n-45th President of the United States, Age 72\n\nI don't even have anything to follow up with. Who the fuck says something like this?I mean, the entire Republican Party would cease to exist immediately if they stuck to good faith arguments.He\u2019s also completely unqualified\u2026despite being president once himself. Biden\u2019s age reflects actual useful experience that has helped him to pass a lot of tricky legislation that is full of things that are highly popular. He hasn\u2019t just sat around yelling at the TV. \n\nNot to mention, they\u2019re basically the same age.Trump dyes his hair blond and, according to his daughter, has an intricate comb-over procedure for his hair. He employs a full-time hair dresser.Trump dyes his hair, tans his face, is loud and angry.  He comes off as being full of energy.  But on the whole, I think Biden is probably healthier.Considering during Trump's medical examination his \"doctor\" said something to the effect that Trump was the healthiest person he had met and he could live to 200. This means Trump is not even middle-aged - take that Biden.Plus Trump is morbidly obese and Biden is in decent shape for a man his age. I wish we could get younger people to vote for but I'll vote for Biden everytime  against Trump.Because complaining about Trump being old is like worrying that a mass shooter broke the speed limit on the way to the crime scene. There are MUCH more important reasons to complain about Trump than his age!I have the best age.  Nobody has an age better than mePlus, Trump is morbidly obeseProbably because Biden is doing everything else pretty well. The old guy has legislated like a madman.It absolutely is pinned on Agent Orange as well.Media needs drama.Biden\u2019s voters are significantly younger than trump\u2019s voters. Trump may also be too old for office, but he is probably close to the median age for his voters so they would never say or think that.\n\nMeanwhile the complaints about Biden\u2019s age started with the parts of his voter base that wants a younger and more leftist candidate during the primary. The republicans don\u2019t actually care about his age. They just heard the complaints and thought that it was a weakness they could exploit.\n\nIt\u2019s not though. Any leftist would vote for a senile democrat over a literal fascist talking about throwing out the constitution. It\u2019s depressing, but it\u2019s not even a close choice.Both are old. Both are not the best options. Two party system is a clown show. \"Anyone but him/her\" mentality gets us all nowhere.Because we all hate trump to begin with. No need to clarify moreBecause trump can spit out a coherent sentence \ud83e\udd21Because Republicans scream about Biden being old 24-7 and Democrats don\u2019t do that much to them.It can be pinned to both at the same time. It's not an either-or situation.I think because the only argument against Biden is his age. With Trump it isn\u2019t even on the list of top 100 reasons not to vote for him. He\u2019s a twice impeached loser who sent an insurrection to the capitol and could face multiple indictments.Must be his amazing hair and beautiful orange skinWe\u2019re not taking a 10, 15, or 20 year difference here. 4 is all. I\u2019ve seen 65 year olds with more advanced dementia than a 80 year old. I was an Administrator in an Alzheimer\u2019s/Dementia Care Facility, and had to write care plans for people with both all the time.Trump is a heart attack waiting to happen. Between his diet, abdominal girth and his anger issues\u2026.To boost a pro DeSantis narrative.> Why is the old man thing pinned to Biden and not Trump?\n> \n> \n\nPeople talk about Trump's age being an issue all the time on here.Trump is fat as fuck which hides how old he looks>If you want to argue that President Biden hasn\u2019t shown any negative signs of his age, that\u2019s absolutely fine. \n\nBut he has. Like any 80 yr old, it is obvious from listening to him that his mind is not as sharp as it was. He speaks more slowly and deliberately/simply than just a few years ago.My dad was 88\u2026could hold a conversation and debate brilliantly. He walked a bit slow but other than that he was quick witted. Thanks to Trump and DeSantis he died of COVID in Florida.When you vote for a President, you also vote for a VP. And that\u2019s because a President of any age can die at any age. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the VP candidate, you can take issue with that. But that\u2019s no reason to endorse ageism.>If you want to argue that President Biden hasn\u2019t shown any negative signs of his age, that\u2019s absolutely fine.\n\nlol wutThe US has never set any kind of mandatory retirement age.  To set a number in stone that means you're now officially incapable is kinda ridiculous.  And if as you suggest it should apply to political positions only (why?) good luck trying to justify that.  Imo taking money out of politics (if that could ever happen somehow) would be the best way to encourage younger candidates to run for office.[deleted]Get used to it.There are real issues with age, but the retirement age is an age we let people choose to stop working, not a mandatory cutoff.Also he's old and center right. I could get off of the old thing (see Bernie Sanders) if I had healthcare, meaningful movement on minimum wage, organized labor options, anti trust, etc..Age limits are always going to be arbitrary, we can do better than that.Tie it to the life expectancy of the nation. If you will exceed the life expectancy at any point during your term, you can't run.I would argue that 72 is too old. 70 is as old as I want them to be. And I don't mean running for office when they are 70. They have to be under 70 the year of the election. Judges have to retire on or before their 70th birthday.>Cannot wait for this gerontocracy to go.\n\nGen X, contrary to popular belief, won't be better.\n\nAnd no one much younger than gen x believes in a United United States after the last 6 years.Why would the country be screwed?  Unlike tRump, Biden has surrounded himself with very capable people.  (Most of them substantially younger than him, btw)  If he became incapacitated the sky would not fall.Technically, Trump is considered a Boomer but Biden is our only President from the Silent Generation.Literally just better than Trump.\n\nI think that guy that died two weeks in might also count, but that's like saying you can fight better than a toddler. It's true but it's not something to brag about.\n\nAnd it's not 'creating controversy' to condescendingly address the very real lament of literally anyone with more than a quarter of a brain.How is Biden a shit choice? I'm genuinely curious to hear your point of view.Did you have to apply to join the cult or is it a bonus if you buy a flag?No bumper stickers yet, but there's a Dark Brandon t-shirt and coffee mug in [the campaign merch store](https://shop.joebiden.com/shop-all/).we had a contractor working on our store who I thought was  60, the man was 83. i would honestly say Biden is par the course for 80,  my only worry is less him dying while in office and more undisclosed cognitive decline. that shit can happen fast especially when you consider how much the office ages every person who has held it.Old > Slightly younger but still old narcissistic fascist.The other candidate is now as old as Biden was during the last electionShould people his age or older not be allowed to vote?You\u2019re right. There\u2019s *a lot* of other things any of these presidents have been doing that should be stressing you out more than age.It's been going on for weeks already. Can't wait for all the arguments that it is wrong to primary against Biden because we need to save democracy.Harris versus who, though?Fun fact: Biden is in the generation *before* Boomers.I agree with your overall premise that the Boomers need can ride off into the sunset any fucking time now . What\u2019s crazy is that Biden isn\u2019t a Boomer. He\u2019s actually older than that.This notion of \u201cpassing the torch\u201d in all of these threads is so sad it\u2019s actually kind of funny.\n  \nWin elections. Asking things to be \u201chanded over\u201d is not a very inspiring rallying cry for the younger generations.ThisDon\u2019t you own the Joe Biden reddit page?Biden isn\u2019t a boomerOf course they do. It's about momentumAdam Schiff\nGavin Newsom\nPete Buttigieg\n\nIn that orderAnd my mom was sharp as a tack in her 90s.  My dad, on the other hand, had a series of TIAs and lost his edge in his 70s.  Go watch Biden's debate performance in 2012 and compare it to how he did in 2020.  He has declined.  He's not going to be like your grandma if he makes it to 102.  If he doesn't step aside now and has a campaigning moment next year where it's obvious he's lost the plot, we are *fucked.*McCain's replacement was why his age became an issue. If McCain had been in perfect health and 35, after he picked Palin everyone would have still suddenly realized how close to death he was.Done.It comes from the right wing trying to demonize the democratic candidates\u2026just look at 20 years of campaigning\u2026.it doesn\u2019t even have to be facts..like Trump, Just say it publicly and I\u2019ll have Gaetz, Gordon, Green, and Boebert repeat it at every opportunity\u2026I have news sources to continually repeat it until it becomes a fact. This IS the Republicans formula.People would make that argument no matter who was the VP. People weren\u2019t ecstatic about Biden either, and here we are.Then do your duty, quit your job, and run.Which he isn't unlike Feinstein.[deleted]Why wouldn't he? Does loyalty count for so very little? Harris has been a standup VP. \n\nAt least she's done nothing to hurt the administration.He has no choice. The media would have an absolute meltdown if he changed the ticket. You would see headlines like, \"BIDEN ADMIN IN CHAOS\" for the next few months. There's no way his campaign wants to start off his re-election bid with that kind of circus.I\u2019ll start really worrying once it looks like the GOP has any reasonable chance of getting their act together. \n\nFox News is facing a well-deserved existential threat, even without some of the GOP turning on them for firing Tucker. Trump is facing increasing legal challenges. And then there\u2019s the whole Trump vs. DeSantis conflict which could go either way, both of which have potentially devastating drawbacks to the GOP.\n\nI still have just a little worry, but I have a lot more hope right now.It will 100% be DeSantis. No way Trump wins the nomination.What are you talking about? Are you sure you aren\u2019t senile? 2002? George bush was in office then. 2022 Biden had some of the best midterm results of any president (2002 George bush may have been better). There was a slim majority for house in 2020 and they barely lost some due to many factors (redistricting, NY and CA not having their shit together) in a midterm that was supposed to swing hard to the right.Didn't the guy doing Trump's medical exam say something like \"He could live to be 200!\"Many people, as they stare at their reflection with a look that is a cross between horror and disbelief.  :PIt's so irritating how he can't just refute something, he has to refute it in a way that is so absurd and unnecessary as to make it, in itself, *have* to be a lie, and a weird one at that.\n\nInterviewer: \"You're old. Should we be concerned?\"\n\nBiden: \"I feel energized and ready to serve my constituents\"\n\nTrump: \"I'm not old, I'm young! I'm a teeny tiny baby man that just emerged from the womb! I'm so not-old that my skull hasn't even fused, and all the doctors are saying 'wow, he's young'! Young and sexy like a baby!\"\n\nInterviewer: \"Er......\">\"Nobody in this country knows more about being young than me!\"\n\n\\- Donald Trump, probablyIt\u2019s a psychological disorder. He likely truly believes he\u2019s mentally young and as sharp as he\u2019s ever been. He notices his belly blocks the view of his little mushroom but to him, it\u2019s weight he\u2019s working on losing.Hey now. A deal is a deal. And the other one got so good at it, he even got a book written about the art of it.>Biden\u2019s age reflects actual useful experience that has helped him to pass a lot of tricky legislation that is full of things that are highly popular. He hasn\u2019t just sat around yelling at the TV. \n\nAlso, Biden actually exercises more than stepping in and out of a golf cart...Your just jelly of his amazing hair beautiful orange skin and tremendous god like bodyHe has had a very effective first 2 years so the age thing is all they have to go on, as demonstrated by the RNCs AI generated attack ad todayIf Biden had not been sabotaged by two Senators in his own party, the accomplishments would have been even more impressive.  If he could have enacted all the agenda items he wanted, I think he may have considered calling it a career after one term.you know besides union busting, an economy that is terrible for everyone except the well off and helping to assure the end of the human race with Project Willow, but I mean other than that, he's doing a bang up job  \n\n\nstill better than Trump or DeSantis to be fairI would take anyone in the Democratic party over Trump. If Trump gets back in the White House it will be the end of the country. Get used to living with secret police, military parades, forced patriotism and continuous civil unrest, if not genocide. \n\nAnd that isn't hyperbole.It got us out from under the boots of a proto fascist in 2020.Wrong, the reason women have no reproductive rights in half the states now is because some people didn\u2019t vote for the best candidate (vote for Clinton.) You vote for the best person,  and arguing that Trump was the same as Clinton is blatantly false and the Supreme Court makeup would be a lot different.Thank you for saying this, it won\u2019t get much love but I appreciate itThey just scream. Doesn\u2019t matter why.Tbf a lot of Democrats remark on it too.Republicans do it to plant that seed nice and early in their adherents\u2019 minds. It is a pithy argument to be made. And it converts any accusations of the same from Democrats as being made out of bitterness. \u201c*Of course* democrats would accuse Trump of being too old\u2014they are just trying to get back at us for calling out Biden\u2019s (or whomever\u2019s) decrepitude!\u201d \n\n\nThat\u2019s how it goes in my family. Although they do tend to agree that younger people should take charge. You know, 60 year olds and such. \n\n\nPersonally, nobody over 60 should be able to sit for president. People should have to be able to reasonably live with the consequences of their rule. That also means no fake arrangements to put businesses and investments into \u201cblind\u201d trusts which we now understand are not really blind. \n\n\nTotal divestiture. Governance by the normal man, not the rich. The rich are an extreme minority and yet they hold almost all seats of power.I am very sorry to hear about your father. A lot of these deaths were preventable. I have no doubt your father was still quick witted and mentally sharp.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that, empirically, mental decline (and physical decline) is much more likely in someone who is 80 than, say, someone who is 50. I do not believe it is disingenuous or misguided to have concerns about President Biden\u2019s age.Is it your position, then, that the same risks would exist, to the same degree, for an 80 year old president and a 50 year old president?\n\nYou are not breaking any new ground by acknowledging that people can and inevitably will die. I am aware of mortality, and I would surmise that most of the American electorate has heard of it as well. And, frankly, my concern is not that President Biden will die. My concern is that he will deteriorate. It should not be decried as ageism to acknowledge that age is a clear and substantial risk factor in many illnesses that can sometimes slowly and subtly diminish higher level executive functions.\n\nAgain, I will be voting for President Biden. But concern about mental decline in this instance is not ageism\u2014it is data driven.So then we can lower the age for all political positions to 18?  Since we are trying to skirt ageism and all.Which part confused you?This is not entirely true. The FAA has a mandatory retirement age of 56 for air traffic controllers, and they are federal employees.It's a fine line to figure out. There are many ways to be approached but your point stands to an extent as well and proves my point to a degree. 30 year olds are more than capable to be in this position as well so why do we have that minimum age to 35? I'm not saying let's throw 18 year olds out there but how are you going to have it on only one side of the spectrum and not the other?\n\nThere are plenty of young people who have the ability to run just like there are plenty of young people who absolutely shouldnt do that. So... Why is this not true for an age cap? Let's be able to view their opinions and make educated decisions. \n\nIt makes more sense to have younger generations in charge because they are closer to the wants and needs of the of future generations and have the ability to empathize and help them.\n\nI'm in no way trained to make these decisions it's just my opinion on the matter based on my observations. I'm a Bernie supporter but I would prefer a younger candidate with the same ideals as he is getting up there and really should enjoy a retirement.Doesn't the military have a retirement age even for their generals and stuff?And the conservative media says get outraged and believe our lies until we get sued.I thought we were just going to skip Gen X and go straight to voting for Millennials.  I'm fine with that.  Sincerely, Gen Xer.Am Gen X and have been in the shadow of the Fuck-You-I-Got-Mine generation my entire life.  I hope to briefly feel the sun on my face if only for a moment\u2026I\u2019ll take GenX/Millenial over a Boomer with no skin in the game and isn\u2019t around to see the results. Anyone younger than gen x has seen first hand the damage Boomers have done to the country.  They\u2019ve effectively killed the American Dream, whilist making sure their generation is safe.\n\nIt\u2019s not the United States of America. It\u2019s every American for him/her/they selves. Can you blame them?>Gen X, contrary to popular belief, won't be better.\n\nLove hearing this kind of folksy truism belief absent of any evidence or factual basis. I wonder how many people in the silent generation argued against transitioning power by saying \"baby boomers won't be any better!\"You should read about Andrew Jackson, or about George W. Bush, or Ronald Reagan, or Richard Nixon, or, at some point, a history bookI voted for Biden. That being said,\n\nMy friends who work in immigration law have been shocked and devastated by his administration. Despite the campaign rhetoric, they\u2019ve governed quite similarly to the Trump administration on these issues. \n\nMy friends who work with the environment share a similar dismay. Despite the better rhetoric, the Biden administration is absolutely failing us regarding the ticking time bomb of climate catastrophe.\n\nHis administration\u2019s actions regarding labor unions, such as the railroad workers unions, have been surprisingly anti-worker, again despite the campaign promises.\n\nRecently, the Biden Administration requested the largest pentagon budget in American history, and has consistently overseen massive increases to our military spending.\n\nI\u2019ll vote for him again if I have to, but there are very legitimate criticisms of this administration. Advocates for the working class, the environment, immigrant rights groups, and critics of the US military industrial complex all share deep disappointment with what he\u2019s done. \n\nArticles like this that scold democratic voters for voicing their concerns are not helping improve the discourse. You\u2019re allowed to express concerns about the Biden/Harris ticket without being ageist, sexist, and racist for doing so.I\u2019m not particularly interested in explaining why having a corporate capitalist as the best option is a shit option. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s like YouTube videos or something. Explaining political ideology online has pretty exclusively felt like a waste of time to me. Maybe someone else will feel inclined to explain.Other than the slow, persistent march toward ecological and societal collapse endemic to the modern Democrat party?What the hell are you talking about?The good news is Republicans seem to love Presidents with cognitive decline, so at least one half of this country should have no issue with this.\n\nHonestly, also, agreed. I hope that Biden has the capacity to remove himself if needed when so many Republicans do not. This is also why I wish he will get a new VP. The odds of them becoming President at some point 2024-2028 (for numerous reasons) is pretty high.Same goes to them! Biden just seems a bit less.... presentNope. As an individual he doesn't feel checked in enough to be president any longer. Personal opinion, you are welcome to have your ownI was just talking about that. A few months ago the internet switched from \u201cat least he\u2019s not trump but all that union crushing sucks\u201d to \u201cJoe Biden is the best president we\u2019ve ever had!\u201dThere\u2019s no way the entire party has literally no one lolI like Harris.\n\nShe's moderate enough to make moderates happy and she's progressive enough to sign things into law.\n\nJust like she's been doing.\n\nHer foreign policy experience is a touch light, but my guess is she's been learning more and more, behind the scenes. \n\nOverall, she's been loyal to the administration and that counts for a lot.We ain\u2019t asking.  The old folks in power have run this country into the damn ground.  I\u2019m simply speaking in metaphors when I use \u201cpassing the torch\u201d rhetoric. The fact of the matter is that the Boomer generation has way more property, money, and they also had a damn socioeconomic ladder they climbed up and then pulled up behind them.  \n\nThat\u2019s why the majority of folks in any kind of power are old as fuck.  They\u2019re economically secure and passed legislation to favor their generation while screwing over the ones that followed.  It\u2019s kinda hard to win elections when the boomers allowed the oligarchs and corporations to have all the money and leverage, while getting a small cut for themselves.  You know what you need to win elections? Money.\n\nPardon me but some of us remember what happened when RBG refused to retire \u2014 women became second class citizens with no right to bodily autonomy not too long after RBG popped off.  You wanna take that chance with Biden? It can always get worse.Own? \n\nNo.\n\nAlso, someone can't own a subreddit in reddit as all reddit properties are owned by reddit.\n\nHowever, I do mod his sub.He was born a couple years before the line for boomer, he essentially grew up with all the same benefits and position as the boomers but wasn't born across the magical arbitrary line. The point is, old people clogging up leadership pathways for decades. And as mentioned, Biden's running for President isn't as big of a problem as boomers who are still holding on to their senate and rep seats for decades on end. Biden is at essentially in the final game in the world series in politics. There is no higher. Diane Feinstien and Chuck Grassely are bigger problems than Biden.Any or all of whom can run in 2028. Why should Biden step down after one term and set a successor up to lose to attacks of \"If Democrats knew how to run the country their President would be standing for re-election\"?Pass, pass, pass, none offer anything different than Biden, why would there be more of the same?I'd prefer all three to Biden, with a definite lean to Schiff.\n\nJared Polis should run. He'd be an outstanding candidateGretchen Whitmer Gavin Newsome[deleted]Look I'm just tired of feeling like I'm lesser evil voting, I'm also self aware enough to know I would be a bad president.You gonna vote for me?He's not like Feinstein, but he's not the guy who killed it in the VP debates.  This isn't 2020, where the pandemic could be used as an excuse for curating public appearances.Ok president Harris it is then.Loyalty should count for nothing when there is a real chance that she could become the president, which is something that most Democrats believe would be a disaster.> I still have just a little worry, but I have a lot more hope right now\n\nI have seen a republican party almost decimated a few times past 50 years...and it should have, after Nixon, Reagan...and then the catastrophic presidencies of Bush 43 and Trump...but every time the democrats let the GOP come back by not pursuing the change the voters wanted and they campaigned on...Trump will burn down the country before he concedes the nomination, even if it means taking down the GOP with him.Hahaha DeSantis won't dare run Trump does not grant him permission. \n\nTrump simply support someone else and humiliate him on a daily basis. Guy went after Disney over some blatantly fascist pointless nonsense. \n\nWhat Trump will do to that man during the primary debates hahaha lordy.Lol. Trump is taking it. Desantis is already in trouble. Republicans stood with him thru his history, term, bungling covid, lying every hour of his term, rape alligations, Jan 6th. They would have dusted him already, but he's in the lead. \n\nWhat could make him lose the nom at this point? What is \"too much\" for Republicans, now?DeSantis is going to flame out long before the primaries.  There will be an 'establishment' not-Trump, but it won't be ol' Puddingfingers.I am not confident in this statement, and that worris me.Trump will win the nomination. That 25-30% of republicans are Trump or no one. They even shows a Florida diner with a woman wearing a Desantis shirt saying she would vote for Trump first.Ronny was dipping into his own supply heavily that dayEvil, spiteful malignant narcissists do tend to hold onto life much longer than actual good people.And he's still growing (just in the wrong places).The best body ever created!  By, you know, God and stuff. The evangelicals love my body. People are saying\u2026 mmm his huge mushroom head. Like a toadstool..For sure, the tax credit extension and universal pre-k were two that hurt really bad. I hope he gets them the next termMy comment is referencing the part in the article where they said he has passed the most legislation since LBJ.Except what happens next time?\n\nLets say we do this again and vote for Biden and he beats Trump again.  The GOP will just send another psychopath to take Trump's place and the stakes will be exactly the same.\n\nWe will forever be trapped in this situation picking \"Safe\" but boring establishment democrats until people get disillusioned and the loss inevitably happens.\n\nWe're going to have civil unrest no matter what happens, I think deep down you know that.Democrats will field younger, more progressive-leaning candidates in '28.  The republicans will continue to ride the crazy wave because tRump's voter base isn't going anywhere.  The boomers are being replaced by younger, smarter, more left-leaning voters who know they have to show up at the polls.  So it'll always be a struggle but to say a GOP win is inevitable is just wishful thinking.Democrats need to stop. There is no alternative for this election. Would be too risky.Thank you for you condolences\u2026.\n\nThe discussion that older people are in mental decline is a myth\u2026if I were to agree with your analogy then people of a certain age shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote\u2026not arguing just going down the path\u2026>My concern is that he will deteriorate\n\nHe already is. He is human, after all.This should be pointed out more frequently imoYes, certainly.No.  Human brains are not fully formed by age 18.>hasn't shown any negative signs of his ageYes I forgot about them.  But they have a legal, federally assigned designation as \"special class\" employees.  The restriction makes them ineligible only to direct air traffic; they're still eligible to take other available federal jobs (within or outside of the FAA) when they hit 56.  It's not like they get put out to pasture.[deleted]Another Gen-Xer here. Totally agree- I'd be perfectly fine skipping our generation for the office.We are the King Charles of generations.I think the problem is self selection after the boomers. Anyone in a good enough position to actually run for president is going to be a Legacy; as in inherited wealth and ideals.\n\nThere's not ***as many*** conservative x/millenials/zoomers. But the ones that are there are more batshit than boomers ever were or learned the game from their parents and just want to supplement their inheritance.I'm not arguing against transferring of power, good try there. I'm against the false hope that pervades this space and others in the [face of overwhelming evidence.](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/03/20/1-trends-in-party-affiliation-among-demographic-groups/) Gen X is 49/43 republican leaning. Baby boomers are 51/43. \n\nGen X isn't going to save you. No one over 50 should be in government, period. And I say that as someone nearing that threshold faster than the environment is collapsing around us.\n\nYou don't get to relax when Gen X or even millennials take the reigns. In fact you'll need to fight harder, as the corrupt will have more to prove and need to try to extract more wealth from the lower classes.George W Bush was an almost comically better president than Biden.\n\nSo was Reagan.\n\nSo was Nixon.\n\nSo was Jackson.\n\nNo idea what the fuck **you're** talking about. They were all evil people, sure. Better than Biden.His hand was forced with Russia and Ukraine for the military spending. That one isn't on him.I just wanted to hear your personal opinion but that's cool. I'm not trying to attack you but I gotta be honest the political world you want to exist will never truly exist. We all want a world where the government will do everything for the people. That shit will never exist in the same way as trying to eliminate crime. We just have to deal with leaders that can at least give us 60% of the shit we need as a country.Ok, who do you think should be the candidate then?I don't dislike Harris, in fact I voted for her in the primary, obviously not a popular opinion thoughI was hoping you would be consistent with your ageism.*draws arrow pointing back to my question*She was actually my first choice in the primary followed by Warren.\n\nI'm mostly asking anyone saying \"don't run Biden\" who they want to see as a challenger>the oligarchs and corporations to have all the money and leverage\n\nThis is how it's always been. The boomers didn't do anything new and different.>\tWe ain\u2019t asking.\n  \nLmaoAND you\u2019re gonna vote for him, happily? Well, if that\u2019s not a surprise\u2026Excellent point that I haven't heard brought up. Short circuits a likely persuasive  talking point.Well when Biden won in 2020, it was by no means certain that he would run again-- in fact I remember most folks assumed he wouldn't and Dems would use the time to prepare a new candidate. \n\nIf the only reason not to move on is fear of Republican attacks-- I have bad news for you. Republicans will attack Dems whether Biden is the candidate or not. The only question that really matters is who can win? If most people voted for Biden because he wasn't Trump, and not because he was Joe Biden, that's not a great sign. Trump will probably still be running, but he's already shown he's better as a challenger than as an incumbent. Hopefully people are still as motivated to vote against him in 2024 as they were in 2020-- but if they're not, then selecting Biden as the candidate will be a mistake that lies squarely at the feet of the party which has done so little to field new candidates both federally and in many statewide elections.He could have leaned in to being a one-term President. That we needed an elder statesman to undo the damage Trump did to the federal government and someone who (as a former 30-year old Senator) understands that the next generation needs their chance to lead.\n\nImagine the contrast of Democrats preparing the next generation to take us towards a \u201c2050 strategy\u201d while the GOP offers \u201c2020 vision\u201d putting forward Trump again. \n\nInstead, we\u2019re stuck with \u201cfinish the job\u201d, a strange indication that this administration needs an extension for the work they were elected to do for the 2021-2025 term. Of course, it makes sense as a slogan for someone at the end of their life - the job may be \u201cfinished\u201d for him - but how much more inspiring would it have been to craft a campaign around building the future Biden isn\u2019t going to see and handing over to leaders who he\u2019d be proud to see step up?That\u2019s a huge weakness. You have to run for two terms or else the party is weak? What a pathetic system.They are both women, but that's where their similarities end.That'd be illegal.For part of a term.  And then another Republican.Loyalty counts for souls and souls matter.\n\nHe accepted her in 2020. Was there any less risk then? No.They haven\u2019t come back from Trump; it\u2019s been all downhill since 2016-2018 for them. It\u2019s also worth noting that the MAGA movement has touched a nerve like never before with people who aren\u2019t politically engaged and with younger voters, myself included.We can only hope. The GOP is cracking right now. Tucker Carlson's text messages are doing a great job at growing that crackI would 10x rather have 4 more years of Trump than DeSantis. Trump is a buffoon that nobody takes seriously. DeSantis is a malignant cancer that will turn us into 1930s Italy by the end of his first termKissinger.All we gotta do is replace Sinema, keep 51 seats in the Senate, and take the House again.\n\nLet's fuckin' go.\"doing EVERYTHING ELSE pretty well\"  \n\n\nEnglish as a second language maybe?There is no other Trump. Look at DeSantis, he tried and failed. Trump is a once in a generation fascist leader. Don't get caught up thinking it's about ideas, it's about a father figure blessing their worst impulses and darkest desires. That's what Trump is. Dad loves you and your hate isn't just OK, it's morally right and justified. \n\nThere was a German guy once who did the same thing.> We will forever be trapped in this situation picking \"Safe\" but boring establishment democrats\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was a safe, establishment Democrat. John F. Kennedy was a safe, establishment Democrat.\n\nSafe, establishment Democrats get shit done.a Biden win in 2024 guarantees whoever the Republicans choose in 2028 wins, this is what liberals aren't seeing because they are shortsighted as usual, \"as long as we accomplish this one next thing, nothing bad will ever happen to us\"  \n\n\nAs long as the electoral college exists, a lot of swing states are determined by working class people, who Biden has done and will continue to do jack shit for.My position is that older people, especially those over 80 years old, are more susceptible to mental decline\u2014I am not saying that *all* older people are in a state of mental decline. Here is one of several studies validating this position: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4906299/\n\nI do not necessarily believe that age should automatically disqualify a person from holding office. I do, however, believe that advanced age should not be ignored cart blanche when it *could* present unique challenges later on. I will concede that I do not believe I presented my position as clearly as it could have been presented.Sure. So, I think a pretty negative sign of advanced age would be cognitive decline frequently observed in individuals over 70 years old. If a person wanted to argue that President Biden hasn\u2019t demonstrated instances of cognitive decline, I wouldn\u2019t feel it necessary to dispute that point because his age is still a factor worth considering.Sorry I was assuming by \u201cmainstream media\u201d you meant the 4th branch of government\u2026that has to make corrections when wrong.Excellent analogy.  \n\nCaptains of Industry 2035-2038>the face of overwhelming evidence. Gen X is 49/43 republican leaning. Baby boomers are 51/43. \n\nFirst of all, please read your own source:\n\n>Generation X voters (born 1965 to 1980) are more divided in their partisan attachments, but also tilt toward the Democratic Party (**48% identify as or lean Democratic, 43% identify as or lean Republican**). The balance of leaned partisan identification among Gen X voters has been relatively consistent over the past several years. Baby Boomer voters (born 1946 to 1964) are nearly evenly divided (**48% identify as or lean Democratic, 46% Republican**).\n\nSo not 49/43-- gen x 48/43 with 48 leaning Dem. Boomers are 48/46, also leaning Dem. \n\nSecondly, voting for a party does not tell you much of  anything about political opinions on issues like gun control, abortion, racial injustice, taxes-- it really tells you nothing. So if you want to argue your point, you should pull up generational opinion on **issues**, not on simply party registration. \n\nThirdly, on a related point you should also be factoring in independents. Statistics show as Gen X independents have grown, they always correspond inversely with Republican Gen Xers. And what is the political platform of independent Gen Xers? **You have no idea**-- your only metric for political ideas that \"save the nation\" is \"are they registered Dem?\". \n\nFourthly, one poll from 2017 is not \"overwhelming evidence\". Why not look at polls over time? Since the 90s, Gen X has drifted leftward at a greater rate than boomers-- generally via registering as independents, which is actually the largest group of Gen Xers, and one which you entirely ignored. \n\nLastly, Gen X is a tricky generation that often gets split up in favor of ages. So depending on how you define the generation, you may be looking only at a segment of it. In Gen X case, we already know that statistically they are less likely to become Republicans in older age as Boomers are-- but older Gen Xers will still show up with a rightward bias. \n\nI would encourage you to look harder than a single poll from 2017 before you wholesale discount an entire generation's potential for political change.Months before the invasion of Ukraine:\n\n\"President Joe Biden has signed into law a $777.7bn US annual military budget \u2013 his first in office. Biden\u2019s approval of the bill was expected; the White House had not voiced any reservations about the increased spending, which took the military budget above its most recent peak of $740bn reached in former President Donald Trump\u2019s final year in office.\" \n\n\\-Al Jazeera, 2021\n\nNow, you could argue this was in preparation for Putin\u2019s aggression and based on intelligence.\n\nHowever, even before that, he voted in favor of the War in Iraq. Not only that, but as a Senator, he repeatedly sided with the Bush administration on increases to the military budget:\n\n[https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/53279/joe-biden-jr/22/defense](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/53279/joe-biden-jr/22/defense)\n\nAgain, I'll vote for Biden once more, but you could definitely make a case that he has been more hawkish than some of his democratic counterparts.Literally anyone willing to prioritize the environment, the working class, and the strength of public services.\n\nShit, give me just *one* of those qualities.  Biden has none.It\u2019s not a citizen\u2019s job to pick out the best candidate to be president out of the millions of eligible adults in the US. It is the systems job to put them forward. We have a system that puts forward shit candidates. A better system would put forward better candidates, and then we\u2019d have the answer to that question.\n\nEdit. Went and let myself get roped in. Won\u2019t be replying again.It's not about age it's about himStacey Abraham that chick from Georgia, Inslee, Newsom, fucking RFK Jr.  You know, someone who is actually under 65?\n\nBefore you say Harris, she was a prosecutor in California. She was overzealous, lied about how casual she is with weed given her prosecutorial record and incestuous relationship with cops. That is not the type of person I want running the country, she is low key authoritarian. I don\u2019t like her and when she was campaigning before she joined Biden on the ticket \u2014 her staffers hated working for her.  That tells you a lot about someone.FDR, New Deal, Great Society.  Hard disagree. They benefited from those policies, once they got power \u2014 they pulled that ladder up so no one else could benefit.But bigotry is so hot right now.I\u2019ve voted in every single local, state and national election since I turned 18 in 2000. I promise you that if anyone other than Trump is the Republican nominee, I\u2019m not going to bother voting for Biden. I\u2019ll sit 2024 out, it is my right to do so.  I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way.  I\u2019m fucking fed up. Trump running in the general is the only way I\u2019m casting a ballot for Biden.  \n\nI think y\u2019all are underestimating Americans who feel similar, it may very well cost Biden the election.  If Trump is the nominee, expect Biden to be given a Republican controlled house and Senate when he wins and it\u2019s gonna be by a nose.\n\nThe Government derives it\u2019s powers to govern and enforce the laws of the land by the consent of the People.  \n\nThat consent can be withdrawn. Silent quitting a thing? Try silent voters. (Yes, oxymoronic)Yes. \n\nAnd?\n\nI'm A Joe Biden supporter. Before that I was a Hillary supporter. Before than an Obama supporter.\n\nAm I not allowed to respond in politics anymore?There was no reason to make that assumption, nobody runs for President assuming they will be a one term President.\n\nTrump being the nominee again is a great reason to choose a candidate who already beat Trump. The argument of candidate fatigue goes both ways, has Trump done something in the past 2-3 years to make himself more palatable to voters? I don't think the 1/6 attacks, the NFT collection, or the indictments won him any new fans and it's unlikely his old fans can vote any harder than they did last time.\n\nLook at this from the Democratic Party's point of view, why take a risk on a new candidate who might lose to Trump when you have a candidate who already beat Trump?They might have been more keen to do that if there was a breakout candidate that appeared in the interim and started gaining traction, like how Obama appeared on the scene in 2006 and 2 years later was a national phenomenon, but that hasn't happened.>Imagine the contrast of Democrats preparing the next generation to take us towards a \u201c2050 strategy\u201d while the GOP offers \u201c2020 vision\u201d putting forward Trump again.\n\nRepublicans would just say Biden couldn't cut it as president, so Democrats are putting up an untested candidate. Trump has experience as president blah blah blah.\n\nIt would be great if after this election, like the literal day after, the over 60 set started preparing and mentoring the under 50 set for positions of power. I'd like to not have to worry that our government leaders are going to break a hip if someone sneezes on them.Welcome to democracy. \"One-term President\" is basically a synonym for \"failure\".[deleted]Welp, there goes my campaign\u2026.There was absolutely less risk because Biden was of sounder mind and body than he is now. There has clearly been a decline in his health since 2020 and you are lying to yourself if you think otherwise.  The Democratic voter base was way less aware of how bad Harris\u2019s vice presidency would be due to COVID halting actual campaigning in 2019-2020 than they are now, so there is absolutely more apparent risk than there was in 2020. Edit: idk what you are saying about souls but that seems like a pretty weak point to make when when making a case for the future leaders of our country.> They haven\u2019t come back from Trump\n\nSee, that is part of the problem, refusal to confront reality. They took the House, almost took back the senate...after Trump disastrous presidency democrats should have a super majority by now, even with gerrymandering...I mean Trump lied, crashed the economy, was incompetent during the pandemic...but even now people believe he has a chance...*Chef's kiss*DeSantis was a nobody who Trump endorsed who while also being a moron speaks the the affectation or a young child who thought picking a fight with Disney for shits and giggles was a smart move. \n\nGod help him if he runs against Trump in the primary. Trump would guarantee if DeSantis won the primary (Trump in prison or a coma) would absolutely ruin his presidential campaign. \n\nDeSantis would be required to perpetually lick Trumps boots for even a chance at winning the primary.Uh the first sentence was answering his question. I don\u2019t know why that made you mad lol. I was just clarifying. Have a nice night I guessThe billionaires want DeSantis, but I don\u2019t see it happening. And word has it they put their check books away when DeSantis started picking fights. It\u2019s really a mess, the Republican party.Blue dog democrats/neoliberals of the 1990s-2020s can't hold a candle to FDR.\n\nYou are ignoring the reality of how the democrat party identity has shifted over the past century.\n\nestablishment democrats today are more conservative and friendly to elites/business.'Of his age' is bringing his age under direct scrutiny, not correcting for it.\n\n'For his age' would be a more apologetic phrase.First of all, I didn't count women as women don't statistically get into positions of power or vote for other women.\n\nSecondly, voting for a party absolutely tells you more about the person than any deeper dive in their politics. If you vote republican, you are okay with giving the death penalty to parents of trans kids. You might not be for it, but you're not against it.\n\nThirdly, Independents have never swung an election. It just hasn't happened.\n\nFouthly, I used a quick source from one of the most trusted pollsters, pretty much every related link in the first 4 pages of google agrees with my argument. I'm not going to list them all out, you can do that on your own if you would like to counter my source instead of making an unsourced, unfounded argument against me.\n\nLastly, Gen X isn't trickier than literally any other generation. All generations are fuzzy. Generational divides are marketing terms loosely adopted by culture and never formalized or updated in literature. Each research paper or poll has to define the generation themselves, because there isn't a consensus. So whatever nonsense you're trying to justify here is just that, nonsense.\n\nFinally, I wholeheartedly encourage you to look at any voting trend in the last few cycles. Gen X isn't voting with the younger crowd, statistically they're not voting, that's not going to change unless social security is removed.I understand what you are saying and I support it. Which is a bigger issue, keeping a radical  Gop candidate out of the white house or having someone do everything you want them to do but doesn't have control of both houses of Congress? I'm not attacking just asking.It seems you are implying his aptitude has faltered. Do you think there should be an aptitude test for voters?Really, RFK jr? You like that anti-science, anti-vax, conspiracy loving, 69 year old asshole over Harris?Yes, FDR did a lot of great things, but he never would have been president if he hadn't come from money. The large middle class of the mid 20th century is an anomaly. Wealth inequality is the norm.\n\nIf you dislike Boomers, you should look to FDR for their creation. His plans created the stability that allowed for the Baby Boom to happen and for the Boomers to generate wealth.You\u2019re so brave.How very noble of you.No. Just moronic.Well I could have guessed that\u2026\n\n\nOf course you are, who\u2019s stopping you?Well that was the mainstream assumption-- you can go back and look for yourself.\n\n>has Trump done something in the past 2-3 years to make himself more palatable to voters?\n\nTrump hasn't been in office for the past 2-3 years. Biden has, and he's the one that Republican and some independent voters will be judging the past few years of. Trump not being in office makes his fuck ups less present and relative-- so unfortunately the motivation momentum will be either for or against Biden. \n\n>why take a risk on a new candidate who might lose to Trump when you have a candidate who already beat Trump? \n\nWell that's what I'm getting at. Did Biden win because people love Biden? Or was it because of the very real, ongoing, threat of Trump playing out literally before our eyes? Its a mistake to assume he won in 2020 and therefore will again without understanding how he won in the first place. Are Democratic, independent, and generally non political voters as motivated and impassioned to get out and vote for him as they were in 2020?I\u2019d argue two things: (1) that Obama is a good example of how people in the Party were willing to support his run, despite his total lack of experience, against the most well-known and experienced candidate they had run in a long time, because they knew he had the potential and needed to built the national support. The reason is that some weren\u2019t sold that Clinton was the right person given her negatives with segments of the population.\n\n(2) that it\u2019s *their job* to develop the breakout stars. It\u2019s extremely risky for a breakout star to do it alone (see above, Obama got some important advocates early on). Why wouldn\u2019t Biden, as our oldest President, not focus on building a pipeline of WH-ready leaders for us so that we at least had a choice at this point? \n\nIn fairness, I do think he has been thinking about that with elevating Pete (who was the breakout star of 2020 - but has been unlucky with the hand DOT has dealt him) and boosting folks like Big Gretch who I think he sees as a future leader. But had he decided to lean into being a one-term President, he would have been able to be more explicit in preparing the soil for a fertile 2024 primary. \n\nThat\u2019s what I want to see from elder statesmen and I honestly think he would have gained a lot of respect, especially among independents.But Republicans aren\u2019t sitting at home scratching their heads wondering how on earth they\u2019re going to attack Biden now that he is running for a second term. \n\nYou know what they\u2019ll run on? That Biden, despite not being much older than Trump, makes people feel nervous when they see him on TV because he just doesn\u2019t seem quite \u201cright\u201d. That he doesn\u2019t have the energy, that he can\u2019t deliver a powerful speech, that he\u2019s a trojan horse for a Kamala Harris presidency. \n\nThe opposition attacks you no matter what - you have to listen to the voters. Between Biden\u2019s approval rating and consistent specific polls that have demonstrated a strong desire to open up the Democratic field, I worry that in an attempt to avoid esoteric attacks from the political establishment that they\u2019ve missed the opportunity to listen to key voters. \n\nBut my opinion similarly doesn\u2019t matter - I\u2019m not plugged in to likely voters (particularly independents) in MI, PA, and WI. Maybe they are more excited about \u201cfinishing the job\u201d than I am.\u201cFailure of democracy.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDelight of a corrupt two party system.\u201dSeriously? I\u2019m not the biggest Harris fan but she is not a stupid person. Palin is an idiot. She couldn\u2019t even name one newspaper she read. Or one important Supreme Court case she disagreed with other than Roe V. Wade. Quick thinker she is definitely not. Haha> There was absolutely less risk because Biden was of sounder mind and body than he is now. There has clearly been a decline in his health since 2020 and you are lying to yourself if you think otherwise.\n\n**Proof please. Medical proof.**\n\nPlease rise and decline then rise and decline and then rise and then decline and and and.\n\nIt's called life.\n\nIf Biden believes he's got it in him, then he does. I haven't heard a single medical professional (who's examined him) say otherwise.\n\n> The Democratic voter base was way less aware of how bad Harris\u2019s vice presidency would be due to COVID halting actual campaigning in 2019-2020 than they are now, so there is absolutely more apparent risk than there was in 2020. \n\n**Proof please.** Actual proof on how the Democratic voter base was more/less aware of how bad a Harris vice presidency would be.\n\n> idk what you are saying about souls but that seems like a pretty weak point to make when when making a case for the future leaders of our country.\n\nI'm talking about our National Soul and how we behave towards ourselves and our friends. One does not act dishonorable and expect to keep our base happy.\n\nI'm taking about loyality. I'm talking about credibility. I'm talking about how firing someone who does their job (based on their own death) correctly, is wrong.\n\nI'm talking about obliterating a huge chunk of our voting base, because we replaced a Black Women, who's doing her job correctly, with some random White person. \n\nBecause, whatever the reasons.\n\nIf Harris had a major screwup. Then sure. I could see a replacement. But she hasn't. Fire her now and you can forget about 2024. It'll be a Republicans wet dream of dreams. The end all of end all! \n\nFiring a Black Women for doing her job, because is he's planning to die in office. What kinda mess is that?!?1. There are no blue dog Democrats/neoliberals left.\n2. The adjective form of \"Democrat\" is \"Democratic.\" It is the Democratic Party, not \"democrat party.\"\n3. The Democratic Party has not shifted consistently over the past century. From FDR, it stayed fairly stable, then shifted to the center for Bill Clinton as a result of Reagan's center-right neoliberalism requiring centrist Third Way Democrats to become the norm to fight back. And over the past 30 years, it has shifted back to the left.> First of all, I didn't count women\n\nNice>voting for a party absolutely tells you more about the person than any deeper dive in their politics.\n\nNo it does not. You might vote Dem because you just didn't like the Republican candidate. There are Dems who support and oppose abortion rights, Dems who support and oppose radical climate action, Dems who support and oppose gun control, Dems who support and complain about things like political correctness and woke culture. The party you vote for doesn't tell how you personally feel about specific issues, and you know that. You don't want to look at the stats on specific issues because, despite your claim that the overwhelming evidence supports you, those polls would refute your narrative. \n\n>Thirdly, Independents have never swung an election. It just hasn't happened.\n\nIndependents are also called \"swing voters\" every election-- so what the fuck are you talking about here?\n\n>I used a quick source from one of the most trusted pollsters, pretty much every related link in the first 4 pages of google agrees with my argument. I'm not going to list them all out\n\nNo-- youre just going to claim the evidence exists but then take it for granted (sounds familiarly conservative to me!). Your source does not show peoples political opinions, only which big tent party they voted for. You've got nothing.\n\n>Gen X isn't trickier than literally any other generation\n\nIt is actually. Gen X is entering retirement. It's currently in between life phases, and this impacts political opinion. Younger Gen Xers will be concerned with different issues from older Gen Xers, and if you cared enough to look at the stats you would see it. On the contrary, millennials are all pre retirement and boomers are all post retirement, so there's more generational unity.\n\nThis is why it's a problem that the only thing you care about is one poll from 2017. You don't give a shit about what Gen Xers actually think. You obviously don't care that Gen Xers have radically less net wealth than Boomers when they were the same age. But if you did, you could easily see why something like net worth or proximity to retirement might impact political views. \n\n>Gen X isn't voting with the younger crowd, statistically they're not voting\n\nAll that tells me is that they're not voting. There's all kinds of reasons someone might not vote-- but you take it for granted, while willfully ignoring the actual data, that this means they're somehow no different from the previous generation. Rather, the evidence shows that Gen X and Younger shows a ton of potential-- they're just disillusioned with establishment, gerontocracy politics which have done very, very little to represent them. \n\nThe reason why you prefer your one poll from 2017 is because it boils down an entire generations potential to whether or not they identify with a big tent, center right Democratic party that is run by a gerontocracy. It makes it easy to other-ise this entire group of people, and push the blame on them. The reality is that it's the Democratic partys job to stay relevant, run successful campaigns, and win elections. If people aren't voting for them, it's worth questioning why-- rather than simply pulling up a 5 year old poll to justify not making changes.False dichotomy.I threw that out there just to see who would catch it \ud83e\udd23 \n\nI\u2019m sorry. My point is.. anyone but a fucking 80 year old dude with a shit VP. The only way I\u2019ll vote for that is if Trump was the other option.So you could say Boomers love their entitlements and feel they deserve them cos they \u201cworked hard\u201d while ignoring that salient fact in your first paragraph.> Well that was the mainstream assumption-- you can go back and look for yourself.\n\nReally? There didn't seem to be any reason to make that assumption apart from Biden's age. Biden was asked several times and never said he was planning to be a one-term President.\n\n> Trump hasn't been in office for the past 2-3 years. Biden has, and he's the one that Republican and some independent voters will be judging the past few years of. Trump not being in office makes his fuck ups less present and relative-- so unfortunately the motivation momentum will be either for or against Biden. \n\nI'm not sure I believe that, Trump makes everything about Trump. In a normal universe 2024 would be a referendum on Biden because he is the incumbent President, and it might be, but if past is prologue it will be a referendum on Trump. The 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections were all referenda on Trump.\n\n> Well that's what I'm getting at. Did Biden win because people love Biden? Or was it because of the very real, ongoing, threat of Trump playing out literally before our eyes? Its a mistake to assume he won in 2020 and therefore will again without understanding how he won in the first place. Are Democratic, independent, and generally non political voters as motivated and impassioned to get out and vote for him as they were in 2020?\n\nDepends who you ask, everybody votes for different reasons. If you ask progressives they voted for Biden because he was less bad than Trump, I'm not sure that's true for normie squishy centrist types.Well, Obama did get a lot of support from the party, but the party/\"establishment\" choice for 2008 was Hillary. That's why that primary went on so long.\n\nOn point 2, I think Biden is doing exactly what you're describing, that's why Pete and Kamala are in the administration, however he's doing it for 2028 and not 2024. This is also why he nominated a Black woman to the Supreme Court and multiple transpeople into high level positions. \n\nThe President of the United States has access to the best healthcare in the world, if age is really such an issue then I trust his medical team to tell him that he is not up to the job for a second term (unlike Trump's medical team, who told him only what he wanted to hear).\n\nNothing you've said about Biden being a transitional leader to a new generation of Democrats is contradicted by him being a two-term President instead of a one-term President. You chose to interpret that description as meaning \"one-term President\".\n\nAlso another point worth noting is the immense cost. Estimates are that it's likely to cost each party as much as $2 billion to try to elect a President in 2024. Why volunteer for additional costs of a competitive primary only to nominate an untested candidate who won't have the advantage of incumbency? We have to do that whether we like it or not in 2028, why do it four years earlier?I\u2019m not going to argue whether or not he is in mental decline (which he clearly is). You can find plenty of proof online. Being a good politician, especially being the president or VP, is not just about doing the job correctly, it is also about inspiring confidence in your base. Just because Biden says he has it in him doesnt mean that voters think he does. The proof is in the polls (for Biden and Harris). As to whether either has made a \u201cbig screwup\u201d is really up to personal opinion and how you lean politically. The whole Biden-Harris campaign is running on being the alternative to Trump, which isn\u2019t what many voters want to vote for. And to your point about acting \u201cdishonorable\u201d, there is no honor in keeping politicians who receive widespread disapproval in power. No doubt this election is a bad situation for all parties, but the Dems can absolutely do better than Biden-Harris.You've done nothing to actually refute my argument of being stuck in this situation facing extreme right wing candidates.\n\nBeing a pedant about adjective forms or minor timeline details doesn't change that.  \n\nAlso we are still knee deep in third way politics due to how it appeals to lobbyists we ran a Clinton in 2016 it isn't exactly ancient history.Women have had the vote for a hundred years and nearly every single country has beaten us to having a female leader in power. If women want to be counted in the discussion of how racist and conservative we are, we need to actually show the world. There are more female eligible voters than male in all demographics.Absolutely no way Massive-Swing isn't a Russian or Chinese plant meant to dissuade people with more optimistic attitudes.\n\nThe account is four days old.[removed]I get it, but let's be honest no political party is ever gonna get everything that they want.>I threw that out there just to see who would catch it \ud83e\udd23\n\nI don't believe you. I've seen some of your other comments now.People do work for their entitlements. They pay into those programs their entire working life. Social Security and Medicare aren't inherited. They were part of the income stability that FDR created.\n\nI know you are trying to say that Boomers benefited from those programs and are trying to trash them before anyone else can, but that's not true. Soc Sec and Medicare are popular with everyone except Republican politicians.\n\nHave a good night and don't hate all Boomers. My parents are left of Bernie and both had the good sense to retire before they turned 70.> You can find plenty of proof online.\n\nSo, that's a no.\n\n>  Being a good politician, especially being the president or VP, is not just about doing the job correctly, it is also about inspiring confidence in your base.\n\nThat's no the job of the VP. The VP is suppose to do what it does by design. That's why all VPs have done it the same way, since forever.\n\n> Just because Biden says he has it in him doesnt mean that voters think he does. \n\nSays who? The voters voted for him and thus far he's got the endorsement of the whole party.\n\n> The proof is in the polls (for Biden and Harris). \n\nSo, no proof. Gotcha. As if polls are proof of anything. Also, I've seen the polls and they seem fine to me.\n\n> The whole Biden-Harris campaign is running on being the alternative to Trump, which isn\u2019t what many voters want to vote for.\n\nThe whole Biden chart is campaign is running on many, many, many things. First is their very impressive records. I don't care about Trump myself, but the whole of the GOP is she ass crazy.\n\n> And to your point about acting \u201cdishonorable\u201d, there is no honor in keeping politicians who receive widespread disapproval in power.\n\nThen expect to not have any power.\n\nYah boot Harris and 2024 is over. We just lost a huge part of the Black vote and we just lost a chunk of moderates that respect honor and loyalty. (Not just because she's Black, but because she didn't do anything wrong and is Black)\n\nThat's that.\n\nRepublicans will control everything.\n\nExcellent plan. If you want them to control everything.> You've done nothing to actually refute my argument\n\nYou've made no argument. You've made statements. I made statements back.\n\n>Being a pedant about adjective forms or minor timeline details doesn't change that.\n\nIt's not \"being a pedant\" when \"democrat party\" is literally a derogatory term and when the timeline is exactly what we're talking about.\n\n>we are still knee deep in third way politics\n\nNo, we're not.\n\n>we ran a Clinton in 2016\n\nHillary Clinton is significantly to Bill's left. They are not the same people.Lol \"neoliberals\" okay buddy, good talk.If mediocrity is the goal, I'll exercise mediocrity on voting day. \n\nI'm pretty busy.I couldn\u2019t think of more names.  RFK just popped into mind and I had an evil grin when I typed in his name. That\u2019s the truth \ud83e\udd23I\u2019m fully aware that I\u2019m generalizing, but it\u2019s mostly out of exasperation. Your parents have their heads on straight, kudos to them.  If only more would do that, I feel like more progress would be made.",

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/politics) if you have any questions or concerns.*Like... This is a good thing. Food safety standards prevent a whole load of bad illnesses. You shouldn't run an uninspected kitchen as a business from your home.Tl;dr: Governor Hobbs vetoed a bill which would've allowed people in Arizona to sell food made in their homes if they register with the state. She says it's for public health reasons. This has incensed the local Latino population, especially undocumented immigrants, who rely on selling food for income. Not the best look for Hobbs based on this with a key Dem voting bloc.And if she had signed the bill, the Republicans would have been screaming about tamale vendors having to register with the State, bashing \"government over-reach\" and fake-crying about vendors who can't afford the fee or follow the new regulations.  \n \nIt's all political posturing, but there's no integrity to the GOP arguments.First they came for our tacos\u2026The best tamales are always the homemade ones, and keeping it illegal won't stop people from making them or enthusiastically buying them. All it does is criminalize brown people trying to make a living and alienate a key Arizona voting bloc. Dumb move.Let me state at the outset that I\u2019m a registered Democrat and consider myself pretty progressive. \n\nMy first question is where can I get my \u201cFree The Tamales\u201d sticker? \n\nMy second question is really? This is still an issue in some states? \n\nI live in Colorado and we have a rather large home kitchen/cottage food services industry here. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve grown up with, but I\u2019ve never felt unsafe about eating food that I bought knowing it was made in someone\u2019s kitchen. Everyone labels their food/preserves and some even have a flyer at their stand. \n\nAs I\u2019ve grown up I\u2019ve developed the mentality of \u201cI know the risks and I\u2019m responsible for myself and my decisions.\u201d \n\nShit for $10 dollars and getting some extra certification I would be down and start my own home food kitchen. I don\u2019t see the issue here other than making it a flimsy political attack against republicans to try and grandstand. \n\nThis veto also underscores how fake and empty \u201cThe American Dream\u201d ideal really is. We as a society cannot hold up people like Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs for starting something in their home, working hard, and making a successful business while stifling it at the same time. \n\nYes their field was the internet/technology, but who knows which one of the many men and women mentioned in this article could go on to start the first Mexican-American owned regional fast food restaurant that they started in their kitchen. \n\nPart of me wonders if this was New Hampshire and it was little old white ladles wanting to sell pies if it would have passed without issue. You cannot deny there is also hardcore institutional racism at work here, even if the Democratic legislature isn\u2019t purposefully saying that it is.I am a  socialist, a leftist, a sometimes reluctant registered Democrat, and would never, ever, ever vote for the fascist Republican party.  But this veto is tone deaf and wrong.\n\nWhen we all share a society that guarantees us decent housing, universal medical care, excellent pre-K through grad school free education, meaningful employment for all at living wages, free childcare, and serious old age pensions better than present day Social Security, and immigration reform that is no longer racist and respects international law . . . come back and perhaps I'll change my mind about brown peoples' cottage industries. Until then . . .\n\nFree the tamales!when the right-wingers threatened us with taco trucks on every street corner, I was excited. \n\nthe right-wing always takes away hope of anything good.That\u2019s crazy!You've got four years, Katie. Try to make them filled with less stuff like this if you want to make it eight (and to stave off fascism).Idk. I'm Latino, so I'm rather favorable to things that might help my people.Why not? If you buy a homecooked meal, you know the risks involved. I should be able to make that decision on my own as to whether or not I want to buy their food. It's also not really any different than being invited over as a guest. The only difference is money being exchanged. It's not illegal to cook out of your kitchen for free, don't see why it should be just because there's money involved.\n\nAnd people are still going to make and sell them under the table out of necessity for money so it's not like this stops the practice. It simply criminalizes it.Idk i feel like it should be up to an individual to decide what they are willing to risk eating not be told to :/ also after having worked in kitchens they are almost never as clean as my home kitchen>would've allowed people in Arizona to sell food made in their homes if they register with the state\n\nArizona already allows this, for foods that don't require temperature control (heating or refrigeration). The new law would have extended this to certain other products, like tamales and tacos.Aren't food and safety regulations generally a good thing though?  Isn't that why we have health inspections of kitchens in the first place?\n\nMost people wouldn't eat at a place where no one washed their hands, there were dogs walking around inside the kitchen, milk being left out all day, and the workers have no protections (or possibly even wages).  There is also no reporting mechanism if they *do* get people sick, the health inspector can't shut you down for pissing in the soup if you've never had license in the first place.It's a GOP-backed bill though. The legislature is Republican.Yes, I did, but you were surprisingly fast and agile when sufficiently motivated.Yeah health standards are racist. \n\n/s> Part of me wonders if this was New Hampshire and it was little old white ladles wanting to sell pies if it would have passed without issue\n\n\n\nA state founded in part by fleeing traitors, who\u2019s track record with institutional racism doesn\u2019t just start suddenly getting the benefit of doubt\u2026..\n\n\n\n\nWe know what\u2019s going on here, because it\u2019s been going on in Arizona since it\u2019s founding. But hey, if they want to get rid of the only decent food in Arizona, we can always use more amazing Latino food up here in Colorado, the more the merrier!You don't know the risks involved if there's no health code. It's different than a potluck at the neighbors' because there's food being made for mass consumption--inherently putting a larger volume of people at potential risk. Money being involved is a reason to regulate it.>It's also not really any different than being invited over as a guest.\n\nIncorrect.  Those who invite others over as a guest have no alternative motivations, no reason to skimp on procedures, quality of ingredients, safe employees, etc.  Those who stand to make a profit and can make more profit by skimping will do that.  It's easy to see how introducing money changes the dynamic.\n\nI don't necessarily disagree with your point that the decision should be yours, though.The food cart and food truck market is incredibly over-regulated in the US.this bill would let them get licensedThat would not have stopped them.It\u2019s Tuesday \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fHealth Standards may not be racist, but the people who target Latino\u2019s with this obvious tactic *are* racist.How's it different than making a bunch of baked goods for a bake sale? That's for mass consumption and money too. Plus allowing them to register their kitchens is a step toward some regulation, at least giving the government a sense of who is involved and where.This \ud83d\udcafThere\u2019s a term \u201cde minimis\u201d which means of minimal impact. Often it\u2019s used to mean activities that are one time or very rare. Bake sales would fall under de minimis, while a business does notA family gathering to make a bunch of tamales a couple times a year and me buying a dozen from a friend at a bar isn\u2019t even remotely what you are describing.

I can\u2019t even imagine the lies she\u2019s going to sling to try to win over Dem/Lib voters.Republicans lie.  It\u2019s all they do.\n\nThat really isn\u2019t news, or a surprise.Quicksand. 2024 will be the Woman's Reckoning.Wow, a republican politician openly lying through their teeth? SHOCKING!\u201cI don\u2019t judge someone who is pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life...\"\n\nBy forcing women to carry pregnancies against their will, you're doing something a HELL of a lot worse than judging them.She's trapped between reality and Khristian Kult Kraziness, like all Republicans are.You mean the woman named Nimrata Randhawa, who claims that America isn't a racist country, but who just happens to go by her Indian middle name that is also palatable to conservative Americans, isn't direct, open, and honest?  Shocking.She can\u2019t move her lips without flip flopping or lyingOoh!\n\nRepublican politician ***lies***! Or dissembles, equivocates, temporizes, obfuscates, . . . Expected behavior, so news?That\u2019s Nimrata for ya.A politician lied? Shocking!Conservatives have been brainwashing their base for decades that abortion is murder. Can't win the GOP primary today without wanting abortion banned in basically all cases.I don\u2019t want to judge anti-abortion women. I just want them to take their heads out of between my legs. This is a one-street of injury. It\u2019s anti-abortion women forcing birth on to pro-abortion women. So She\u2019s right. She\u2019s not judging pro-abortion women, but she will continue to tell pro-abortion women that it\u2019s moral and ethical to use the state as a means of forcing her will on pro-abortion women. \n\nThere\u2019s something about her I just don\u2019t like. I\u2019m infertile AF, so I know I have no right to tell any woman about her lived experienced inside her body. Nikki\u2019s husband was adopted, she had infertility issues, and one of her friends was raped. She has all that wisdom and somehow came out of the other side of it as anti-abortion. I\u2019m sorry. What? Homie, please connect the dots.\n\nNikki\u2019s vibe is she\u2019s spent the past couple of decades turning her nose up at pro-abortion and refusing to listen to any valid points for the f-words (feminists) about bodily autonomy. And now she has to find a way to reckon her minority, ill begotten opinions with women who she has been looking down on. It\u2019s not a good look.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to look at pictures and videos of dead babies with your Susan B. Anthony friends, don\u2019t show up wishy washy and not committed. If you\u2019re a misogynist, be a misogynist. We all see you Nikki.Shes fake and hates her own identityRemember that time Haley suggested raising the retirement age to fund SS and Medicare? At a time when Americans average lifespan is declining. F that! Tax the rich. Pay for programs.Who gives a shit what she does or doesn\u2019t do. She is a nobody. She will lose the primary, then get on one of those shitty cable news programs, where she will slowly die a little on the inside while she goes home and develops a drinking problem. Bye Felicia.Didn't she defend the Confederacy?20 weeks, minimum, except in cases of rape, incest or potential damage to the fetus or mother.\n\nNow gimme all your votes, nom nom nom.She will drop out it gonna take a lot of money to go against trump.It would kill her chances of getting the nomination.Lol.  Someone told her to sit down.>Is anyone really dumb enough to believe republican candidates anymore?\n\nMajority of Republican voters.Yes, quite a few actually and it\u2019s really sad and patheticObfuscation and Republican are synonymous.Apparently fickle swing voters \ud83e\udee3I don't think she last that far.More fundamentally, she understands the same thing as Trump: any laxity in anti-abortion absolutism will result in losing in Iowa, Missouri, Alabama, Idaho, . . . and such absolutism will result in losing Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, maybe also Arizona.\n\nGiven the state of the current GQP, the only path to winning a presidential general election is maximizing GQP voter turnout. Any positions calculated to attract independents will reduce MAGA turnout. Any positions calculated to maximize MAGA turnout will lose suburban voters. Dobbs has made electoral politics far more difficult for Republican presidential candidates, and THEY DESERVE THAT DIFFICULTY.they don't. They just hate democrats because the man on TV said to.I don\u2019t either although Trump hasn\u2019t named a running partner\u2026Kudos for the brilliant snapshot of the GQP political conundrum! I'm not American,  and I didn't quite get the Dobbs reference.  Is it Lou Dobbs perhaps?It\u2019s that or they choose to not believe what the Republicans are saying. My sister voted red, I told her about the abortion leak and she\u2019s like \u201coh, it\u2019s not official so it doesn\u2019t matter yet.\u201d Or when I said Republicans are doing XYZ, and it\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t think they would actually do it.\u201d\n\nPeople are choosing ignorance because they don\u2019t want to see the truth that people are horrible human beings in the Republican Party.Republican voters have been whipped into a constant frenzy for decades over non-Republicans because people got some rights that they didn't (and don't) think deserve rights. Moreover, changes were forced on them. All the men on the radio and later TV did was parrot their feelings back to them. It's not hard. They don't care and make their feelings and positions known to anyone listening. Media is just getting rich off of GOP voters.\n\nThey like being validated and also, it helps with their goals. It's a win-win relationship. But are GOP voters like this because media told them to be like this? Oh, no. A big resounding no.Trump can\u2019t even get along with a mirror. The only suitable running mate is a void, an absence of a person. Unfortunately Pence has already opted out.It's the *Dobbs* Supreme Court case, wherein the Supreme Court arbitrarily reversed a 50 year precedent in *Roe v. Wade* establishing the fundamental right to an abortion.\n\nNow that *Dobbs* is the law of the land, Republicans have to admit that abortion bans are extreme and unpopular or admit that they support extreme fundamentalist abortion bans sweeping the nation.  \n\nThey may even get asked about whether a national abortion ban is something they support.  Just answering that question in any way, shape, or form, would make the demographics unfavorable to any GOP nominee in a general election.GOP voters are scumIf Republicans are horrible, then what are the voters?\n\nLOL.\n\nThey are getting something out of this. Besides, they feel like they are right and it's everyone else that's wrong.There\u2019s plenty more Zombies that could fit the bill\u2026Cruz, MTG, Gaetz, Bobert \u2026> Now that Dobbs is the law of the land, Republicans have to admit that abortion bans are extreme and unpopular or admit that they support extreme fundamentalist abortion bans sweeping the nation. \n\nSimpler if more metaphorical: the Republican dog caught the car, can't unclench its jaws, and the car is now speeding up.\n\nOn a tangent, unless Republicans win majorities in both Houses of Congress, there isn't going to be a nationwide abortion ban. As long as a Democrat is president, Congress won't be able to override that president's veto of a nationwide abortion ban. If Republicans have undivided control AND the Senate exempts abortion bills from the filibuster, it remains to be seen whether SCOTUS tactically ignores the 9th Amendment and allows a nationwide ban.\n\nOutstanding reasons to vote for Democrats in 2024.They got the tail of the tiger and now they can't let go.It may be boring political tactics: pre-Dobbs, abortion drove the anti-abortion zealots to the polls, but post-Dobbs Republicans have to toss those voters red meat like nationwide bans to keep their turnout where it had been. Sadly (just so sad) for Republican politicians, placating the Evangelical whackos will likely drive suburban small government types away from the GQP. IOW, what may be needed to win Iowa, Missouri and Indiana may lose them Wisconsin, Michigan, Pannsylvania and maybe also Arizona.\n\nThat is, while Roe was the law of the land, anti-abortion stridency helped Republicans. With Dobbs the law of the land, what have Republicans done for the anti-abortion zealots lately?",

In January 2005, the high court rejected an appeal from a Dallas-based architecture firm seeking over $25 million from Trammell Crow Residential Co. for alleged copyright infringement. The case was first brought to light by Bloomberg on Monday.\n\nAs with every other story coming out about the conservatives on the Supreme Court, I suspect that this is barely even beginning to scratch the surface of the corruption and bribery going onThe Republican Christian conservatives on the Supreme Court will no doubtedly use their family values to do what they always do.\n\nThe wrong thing.And he gave the judge half a million dollars worth of travel vouchers? Interesting ethics there in the court formerly known as supreme.Don\u2019t forget - his wife is actively trying to move our country into fascism! But tell me more about how the Clintons are criminals\u2026If there is no effective way to prevent corruption of the court, at least expand it in size. It would make it harder for one billionaire to corrupt enough of them to be effective.But of course!So we\u2019re definitely at the point in the ti line where we truly find out our SC is bought out. And controlled.\n\n\nAaaaand then nothing will happen. \n\nWhat\u2019s the point of even knowing anymore? Nothing in this country is changing. They\u2019ve got this so set up and framed out. There\u2019s a snowballs chance in hell anything of matter will change at this point.America loves blatant fraudNothing to see here, just a run-of-the-mill Nazi paraphernalia collector buying off the Supreme Court\u2026Well yeah\u2026why do you think he paid so much in bribes to a SC Justice?Oh, I'm sure that was decided fair and just....LOL!! yeah right fucking scum!Can someone give even a theoretical example of a person who has billions of dollars in this country who does NOT have business before the Supreme Court?I wonder how many people on each side (Dems & GOP) they have researching for dirt/scandals against each other lolShocked Pikachu face\"Say it ain\u2019t so..\" etc. etc.Of course he did.  He didn't purchase a judge without an expectation of benefits.What normal people used to call a bribe, is now just a political donation.\n\nThe supreme court is anything but fair and just.Oh Tom \ud83d\ude44When the oversight is \u201cjust trust us, we are so high and virtuous we\u2019d never abuse this institution\u201d that tends to happenIt isn\u2019t going to be corruption that brings this old pervert down (all due respect to my general avoidance of kink shaming). Thomas had what would now be call an addiction. A light switch didn\u2019t go off when he took the oath. Ginny is only one woman he is a man of endless desires. He has crossed a line during the past 30 years, when his sexual peccadillos are uncovered Thomas may feel she shame he should feel about his corruption. \n\nGenerally, a couple addictions are how Kavanaugh is owned as well.\"The only Lord I apologize to is God and I will do whatever to bring his Kingdom unto Earth.\"Um... Are you aware of this thing called Congress?I\u2019m more concerned with how much fervor seems to be going into it. It\u2019s always been plenty incentivized to go full court press on each other, but de-incentivized because it creates so much chaos. But now it\u2019s ratcheting up faster and faster.\n\nI don\u2019t like where this is headed.\n\nOr, rather, I think it\u2019s going to get a lot worse before it gets better. While I appreciate the public getting greater insight and information on corruption, I have this feeling that there will be some middle part, that we haven\u2019t hit yet, that\u2019s going to be worse than things are now.You mean to tell me the $200,000 debt Kavanaugh owed that magically disappeared just before his confirmation process was not actually related to baseball tickets?Oh that thing that\u2019s also owned by billionaires and special interests?Scratches head\u2026.how did he afford that house with so much baseball tickets debt?That was actually my point. But I reread my comment and saw that it might imply that Congress would hold then accountable... Bwahahaha!!!",

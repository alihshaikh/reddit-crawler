    "Comments": "Historians of the future are going to have an incredible amount of material to work with for the past two decades. Every time I bring it up people keep pointing out \u201cdata rot\u201d but there\u2019s such a ridiculous abundance of data that even just a small fraction of it surviving will still be more than historians ever get to work with. Not to mention that a lot of data gets converted and maintained through projects like the Internet Archive.Already Google Streetview offers a historical view of what our towns and cities looked like 1, 2, 3 years ago.This took me an extra moment to grasp. Great shower thought.\"And here are my great-great grandparents!\"\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/J2MrY\n\nEdit: nsfwWith VR and kung fu, they could rrname it Google Matrix.We should create a Google flat earth and charge all the flat earthers to use it. \"Google, even though you\u2019ve enslaved half the world, you\u2019re still a damn fine search engine\" I just want a Google Earth that's in real time.  I want to check up on things... \u201cSo....wait. The world wasn\u2019t mostly underwater?\u201dWhich version of the future? The amazing thing is that's already beginning to happen. New York City has publicly available aerial views of most of the city from *1924*.Ah well people are gonna find a way to use it for porn. I had an idea for a website that was essentially this, but for animal tracking and migration patterns.\n\nI had this idea when I read that 40% of wildlife has been wiped out since 1960. \n\nI wanted to create an interactive globe that could track any number of species and overlay a color coded map per species. But, I'm not at all technically inclined. I know the information to create it is out there, but it's just way too much for me to handle on my own.\nhere is a 3 decade timelapse from google earth. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/dec/05/evolving-earth-captured-by-google-timelapse-videoMuch like we view the past as black and white, they'll view it as pixelated and janky. \n\nKind of like porn from the 90s.Future fights on if that was actually ice at the north pole or a smudge on the satellite lens.Reading recommendation:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days\"What's all this green stuff?\" You're assuming there is a future. I'm just waiting for GTA: Google Earth. ...that is, if a blackout doesn't happen\n\n***spoiler alert***\"Look at all these people from the past century just walking and living their lives.\n\nThis is depressing,\n\nThey're all dead.\"Warning, repost: https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/73e7kg/100_years_in_the_future_you_will_still_be_able_to/?st=J8X39WZF&sh=ffb1fae9I feel like along with our technology and ability to document everything in our lives, there will rarely be a moment in history where we will want to look back and wonder about how people were living, at least with the deep passion that historians have over history. There's less mysticism.\n\nThat said, I bet 100 years into self driving cars people will look back and think we were crazy for driving our own carsI still find it crazy that a lot of places have streetview from 2007, 10 years ago.  \nI've had this morbid fascination with seeing how certain cities are slowly decaying, and others are growing.   \n \n  \n  \n(And also looking up \"murder houses\" or houses were bodies were found yeeeaaarrssss after they died, then you think... holy shit. There's someone dead in there. Nice repost dude, stealing u/IS_THIS_A_COMMENTS work?Ah I see you stole someone's shower thought.The first good shower thought ive seen in a whileJust imagine how badass the Assassins Creeds game maps will be. The fact that everyone and their mothers carries a pretty high quality camera also sets up incredible amounts of information for the future. Like anything significant that happens has dozens of perspectives The reality is actually breathtaking. \n\nI remember studying about Victorian era living, the workhouses, the filth, urbanisation and whatever else. But imagine learning about that, and being able to literally go through different stages, showing how landscapes changed and how cities expanded, being able to show the progress from sparsely populated regions to full blown cities and then being able to zoom in to historic locations and see events in a time lapse. \n\nFuck, school will be amazing in the future.Hahaha! It will be stored in .jpg11.0 and in 50 years we will be using .jpg87.3 and any earlier formats than 40 are now incompatible. Also, Flash would have been replaced by Extra Flashy Plus with no backwards compatibility.\n\n\nNot even got into which operating system we will be using that time! So if they take a picture now then in several hundred years they'll be able to know what it was like hundreds of years ago? That's awesome!Every picture is of the past.I've been thinking of this for years and always wondered if others thought about how this is a great futuristic project. I think the idea came to me a few times because there was some changes to my city, like this walk bridge. It's built now and will become the normal, but people of the future or people that remember it not being there will get to look back and have a look how things used to be. Places change all the time, things added and removed. It'll be the little things that are local that'll be important for people, like being able to say 'that's the little shop I used to get sweets when I was a kid' if it's no longer there anymore.\n\nI've always thought of it as creating a map, or globe of history, that'll we'll be able to virtually walk around. I can imagine years down the line in like 2117 there being history lessons where people are able to put themselves in the centre of a place in 2017. With it being a 360 view, they should probably make it 3D, for future VR use. Although its a fun thing to use now, I can see it being very important in the future.Yea so the aliens will knoe what we were like before we killed ourselves.It's being used to map the rohingya massacre right now. Countries will find it hard to deny their wrongdoing in the future like TurkeyFuture people: \"I always imagine the past like in low resolution\"What the fuck. I posted the same thing here a couple of months ago https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/6kxnwb/if_google_street_view_saves_its_old_images_it/ I wish I could have made it to the front page.I'm pretty sure that there is a function to upload old maps to Google Earth and overlay them with current maps, atleast thats what my father (who has a use for this) tells me.That\u2019s an optimistic expectation of a company...or the earth. https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/73e7kg/100_years_in_the_future_you_will_still_be_able_to/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage\n\nyou've nicked my idea and done it back to meIn a hundred years modern photos will be at least a hundred years old!That is, before Skynet kicks in, of course. What was it like growing up in your neighbourhood dad. Well I can show you everything, son :D...how is this a shower thought RemindMe! futureI'm waiting for Google Universe.But in reality everyone will just go look at what their house looked like in 2010Just think about Google Street View 100 years from now. It will be an incredible tool for historians to be able to \"drive\" down the streets of our past and see exactly what they looked like in 3D.Google Earth already let's you do a street by street view of Oklahoma.mind blownI had the thought that you meant by, say, next year they'd have aerial detail of the 1700s.Flat?You're assuming that Google both stores this data in perpetuity and that Google will be around in 100 years IIRC the wording for tenses like that would be \"In the future, google earth will be able to show what earth looked like now.\" Or \"...would be able to show you it's entire history, hundreds of years in their past.\"\n\nIf we don't face complete extinction in the next 20 years lmao  This is very awesome but we'll already have millions of pictures of the diarrhea we used to eat as well. I can see you're an optimist. Good one That's an interesting thought.Was thinking about this last night, but in reverse. If you could monitor the entire night sky and log and analyze it over time. We already do this, but maintaining a long term record in one format would be awesome. And then analyze all of the data. You would learn some crazy shit for sure.\n\nAnd most likely google maps of every single planet. We already have mars. Do you think as interplanetary travel becomes a thing , they'll change their brand to google galaxy or something? Best shower thought in a while.  I hope so, my childhood home will be underwater pretty soon with all these intense weather patterns and flooding. Bye bye Florida! \n\nI was just talking about how I'll be able to show my kids my old house through Google earth some day...That's assuming google saves the data that long/continues to exist as a company.\n\nBoth good assumptions, btw, but it's hardly a sure thing.Am I missing something here? Like no shit? It's a picture. I feel like I'm missing something op is taking about hereAre they actually archiving this stuff tho?I'm currently in undergrad studying geology, and this exact thought was the basis behind my dream for some time now. If I take core samples from localities around the world (recruit like 20 people to work with me), then I can have great data on the general topography and strata of almost every area. I hoped I'd be able to link GIS and autocad or some game development software together in order to make it happen. \n\nI wouldn't of course be able to take core samples every 10 feet but the good news is accurate maps with layers exist for most localities anyway. And then I would hope to advance my data gathered with a core sample every like 50 miles eventually, while filling in assumed or predicted areas in between \n\nUltimately, I want to be able to open up the program and see what my neighborhood looked like 10k years ago. Could've been overlain by a mile thick glacier, or could've been part of a giant mountain chain.How about releasing your ocean images instead google? There is and has been glitches showing unintended photos of it in parts of the app so there's no pretending you don't have it mapped In 100 years a huge EMP from the sun will wipe everything so there is that.If it still exists, of course.I salute your optimism.We might have a thing going with https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/27/16371830/assassins-creed-origins-learning-mode-discovery-tourIs the old satellite imagery kept, though? And is it accessible? When, if ever, will there be a \"legacy.maps.google.com\" ?I'm already enjoying the street views from last decade.Or what google wants to think the earth looked like ...This has to be my favorite shower thought. I think you mean Walmart-Earth.If we ever figure out faster-than-light travel, it would be pretty awesome to point a regular old optic telescope (exceptionally powerful, obviously) back at Earth. Depending on how far away you've traveled, you'd be able to look back at the Earth that was and see (at the least) pre-continental drift landmasses, and even watch the stages of the shifting as you travel closer and farther away from Earth.Then users could time travel in street view. If we make it that long...\nWell aren't you optimistic about our ability to prevent catastrophe.great shower thought yeh.  it's gonna be a totally different mindset then. total information Glad to know that there are still some humans with optimism enough to think humanity will survive a hundred years at our current pace...Think of all the ancestors cheating on their spouses that can be located. The present is already past.And everyone will complain about the bad resolution from back then.Don't think soOnly if they store the data somewhere. Google seem to be dropping features all over the place (including the more advanced date search queries you used to be able to do). I assume they are rewriting parts of their codebase and forgetting things; don't know if it's affecting their core architecture. Certain areas by me have overlaid historical aerial images. Goes back to 1937 and 1951 IIRC.Google earth already has a moon view where you can view images of the moon in relation to where they were taken. We are not that far off.Just think of the music, TV show, and movie catalogues people will have available in a few hundred years.In the future we will have entire \"Google earths\" of Interstellar planets... and walk around on them with VR headsets.Define \"in the future\".My main go-to for showing people this was showing New York on 9/11. You can see the smoke from spaceAnd hopefully versions for planets that are hundreds of light years away.\n\nStreet view especially would be great.\nBy then Google would have discontinued the serviceThere's already image of the Texas coastal areas post-hurricane Harvey, from early October.Because Google is run by lizard people!However, it will be content relatively similar to the content we have today.  In hundreds of years, smells, thoughts, feelings, etc may be recorded.. not just that boring 2d material.They should randomly place Waldo around the worldBig data analysts are the future historiansYou are assuming that the human race hasn't killed itself off by then. I give it 50/50This is why big data is so important.And Facebook will be a book of the dead, chronicling an entire civilisation....This will be great for landscape ecologists trying to understand the effects of land use change on the environment.If Google makes it to hundreds of years old, sure. Most companies don't. Assuming Google doesn't become our monopolized overlords and we don't experience Orwellian thought police.Maps used to have a timeline feature that would show historical aerial views of what you were lookin at, if any existed.\"Wow! The ocean used to be so blue!\"\n\n\"I can't believe how many trees there were! Everything is green!\"\n\nWhat makes you think Google will still exist at that time? Only if we last that long...Being an anthropologist in the future is going to be so annoying: so much data with so much variability of use, you\u2019d be horrendously drowned and with the \u201canonymity\u201d of the Internet plus a significant amount of time and you discard a large part of the Internet without the ability to remove it Maan. I posted a shower thought almost like this once, but with google street view. https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/6mbxkf/in_the_future_google_street_view_is_going_to_be/?st=j8vwjazr&sh=bd2a70d2Dammit I thought they were gonna go back in time for a minute There will be many dead websites. Also so much to discover.\nEven reddit posts will be history.This thought makes me really happy.\n\nThanks Friend.I think this is my favorite showerthoughtAnd people still will not care about history.The National Library of Scotland provides something like this for the UK:\nhttp://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/side-by-side/I'm wondering what can be done to revert Google Earth into the past? Can we use science to 'see' the past?And those views will be visible on small screens in the Google cages where the remaining humans are kept.   \nCan't you already go back and see the changes since the beginning of Google Earth? (I know it's only been less than 10 years, but still...) *laughs in Skynet*I love this ideaSo here's a question - is there a way to access previous years' Google satellite imaging? For example, when looking where I live over the years, I can see it's updated periodically. However, I don't know a way to check out yesteryears. Assuming it doesn\u2019t all get wiped out in some crazy unknown catastrophe or get lost only to be uncovered and found out that there\u2019s no way to power it on or off anymoreI remember google maps used to have a slider where you could switch between images from different dates.  \n\nAnything like that still exist?Unless the solar flare.....I wonder if they will also unblur everyone's faces when enough time has passedbecause the petabytes worth of pictures and videos won't be enough...I just wish they could have started this a hundred years ago. It would be so cool to see my house lot in 1901Dang, I didn't even know Google was around hundreds of years ago. Silly, you guys.  Humans won't be around in a hundreds of years.Before we majorly fucked it up... and then fixed it?Doesn\u2019t it get updated or do they store the images That\u2019s so coolYou know it is quit possible that such strange tech like the internet was around at some point in the ancient world but we lost the means to use it. We assume that people in the future will be able to use the information on the web. If anything happens to the network all that information could be lost and it would be like starting all over again.Assuming we\u2019re around that long But who will feed the children?It is so weird that the world used to be black and white, now it is color...I wonder what it will be in 100 years from now?Entire view of the planet we came from\n\nFTFYim not satisfied until it has cameras that pass through black holes and allow us to view dinosaurs roaming the earth in real time.I feel like in a way the fact that we document every second moment  today means that we are destroying the idea of history in a way. \n\nEvery event continues to live on in some way into the future, and there's no sense of history having gone away thats not coreect it will never happenyou can already visit the past on google earth...Yeah but why look at the earth in standard def when the future holds super duper definition? Now you can truly shower anywhere... r/Showerthoughts come for the ideas stay for the scented soaps.This is one of the first shower thoughts that made me say (in Keanu Reeves voice) \"Whoa.\".Optimism. I like it. This is so interesting, I never thought of it like that. I used to spend my free time in college going round random streets in the world and seeing where I ended up.\nI must admit, in my own village, there is a road that with one press of the mouse, transitions from 2005 to 2016, for some reason? And everything looks so different, it\u2019s like time travelling and reminds me of what my village was like as I was growing up, I can only imagine if it works like that in a few hundred years!Funny how many wonder about what Hisotrians will do with all the Data?\n\nYet nobody knows the first picture ever sent. The first Webcam etc...\n\nThere is already history to do. That's a thing made by the Internet, if you want to see into the future, look into the past, into the beginnings of the Internet!That is until the Digital Dark Age starts.We have hundreds of years worth of data, but it's not as good as we have now.\n\nIt'll be the same in the future.In 1 month someone else will post this and you will be just as mad as the person you stole this from is now.Hahahah as if there was a future for humans in hundreds of years. The singularity is coming. We will turn into machines and everyone will know everything so there will be no need for historians anymore.That will be so awesome. Just adjust the slider to move into the pastThey reminds me. I flew across the country to buy a new car. A few miles out of the dealership, I ran across a Google maps car. I need to look and see if they got me.Your assuming we don't kill ourselves off first.This will be perfect for our alien overlords to study our society while simultaneously wiping any trace of us from the face of the Earth.  Probably as a premium service.\"Holy shit, it's your Grandma Karen speaking to the manager again.\"What future?Unless there is another Dark Age between now and then. Ah Google Earth...it can't even show flat earth correctly.Unless something happens and the internet disappears Hp or conexant will buy them and immediately delete and scrap everything they have ever done. . It's one of those things that seem cool to us now, but in that future, it is going to be a meh thing you have to use for homework. to us, a historian in the future is a futurist who studies the pastIs Google a hundred year company?For a Burning Man project a few years ago, I recorded all week long with a panoramic video camera setup on a fixed tripod.  Next time, instead of the cameras, I installed a fake tourist telescope that was actually a video player where you controlled the portion of the scene displayed by moving the telescope, and the effect was that you were looking back at the previous year in real time.  You could follow 'ghosts' walking by or riding bikes, often circling around to see what this thing was.\n\nIt worked OK for being done on a shoestring budget, but imagine this sort of thing when you have *years* of good-quality video from the same place.  We'll have a much greater connection to our past - assuming anyone takes an interest.I highly doubt google earth lasts 100s of years. By 2101, we should be able to view 100 years into the past using google earth, should it survive or another technology integrate it. I don't think the past 2 decades will really matter.. as all of you have mentioned theirs so much data since technology has increased these past 2 decades. It's like the 1900's and before that will matter mostly since paper records and what not that haven't been discovered by the year 2017 will most likely be lost to the ages so what we have is what we have and they will have to work with. If we ever have a large scale war the documentaries about it will be very will done. massive tank battles in full colors . You have a lot more faith in humanity than I do.But this is also based on the idea that something catastrophic won\u2019t happen to mankind.google time travelWill be able to but won'tExclude China though...... You can do this currently-kinda. In my area Google maps came around in 2009, 2012 and 2016. It's fascinating to see the regeneration in that time. Agreed though it'll be great for historians.Oh man, my mom's yard sale will be immortalized.No, the lizard people and the illuminati (frankly, they're the same) will enslave all of us and the earth will explode first.Marc Marron said it best \"We will all be immortalized as content.\"\"remember when we had trees?\"And to think that it all started with an algorithm that calculates the PageRank of a webpage by finding the number of hyperlinks linking to that webpage and the number of hyperlinks linking from that page...\"I didn't know that much green was in the whole galaxy!\"Thanks for awesome thought ; ) Who is to say that Google will still be here in 100 years?Yet there will still be nut jobs who still believe the earth is flat. It can already do thatWhich will be incredibly fascinating and utterly devastating...I still can't wait until we are able to view any place in the world in real time.One step closer to ancestor simulations.To go a step further, imagine what could be if we ever discover a method for teleportation:\n\nYou could build a satellite, teleport it, say, 100 light years away to a location in space that has an unobstructed view of earth, and then use it to actually record events as they unfolded 100 years ago.  How amazing would that be?\n\nWe could witness famous battles throughout history. Watch the Egyptians build the great pyramid, etc. But obviously, teleportation would have other great uses :PI got to see my house 10 years ago.\n\nI started to get really, really sad looking at it. 10 years ago, the future was bright. Now? Not so much.They have uploaded aerial footage of London and Paris from the 30s already and almost every major german city has footage from the early 40s, too. Pretty depressing when you compare them to the current one.Just the paved over bitsI was thinking about this, just wondering around looking at old buildings, now we have Google earth which has a time line button so you can street view 5 years ago, it's amazing to think people can look back in 100 years time and see how things used to be.Google Time And Space!I find it adorable you think google earth will exist in \"hundreds of years\" lolAs soon as we can make large scale particle simulations on computers, we can run them backward and figure out what happened previously. Not saying this will happen soon or is even possible, but if it is, we could simulate our world and run it backward to observe actual historical events. I think the accuracy will be limited but sounds coolOne of my favorite books as a kid was Motel of the Mysteries because they just got everything wrong Assuming they keep updating it.Sorry I didn't go to college :D Why is most of China only available in very low resolution? No details? What gives?My childhood home's map information is so old a school building that was demolished 15 years ago is still there on Maps. It's nice to reminisce. But damn, pls update. Bing is actually quite up to date (as in only ~3 years old).Since google update \"google earth\" every now and then they should have an archive of the past. Like archive per year that is accessible to all.Archaeologist here. Funnily enough we already use archived google earth imagery to assess land use history when we go out to work on a new site. Helps us understand the level of ground disturbance that might have messed up the buried archaeology in recent years. Fuck that's so cool.So if I wait an hour, google will have the view? WhoAaa DuuuDdEeWhy does that make me feel sad?The challenge is for the company to stay in business for hundreds of years. By then it will likely be some other company... like Lougle for instance. Street View can be a trip down memory lane.But I doubt 2017 will appear as long ago to 2117-ers as 1917 does to us.Imagine walking through Google Street view in a virtual reality headset. It would be somewhat bizarre since everything would be frozen, but it's probably the closest we'll be able to get to travelling back in time.\n\nThe next step would be to try and video record the streets with a 360\u00b0 camera. Take a virtual ride through the streets of yesteryear. There's probably not enough resources to store that data though :( It already has a historic function where you can see older images.You can already do it for the last 30 years with the [Google Earth Engine Timelapse](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/)Didn\u2019t they do this in Japan and there was a big backlash. Your great great grandchildren will have an incredibly detailed detailing of what you\u2019ve had for lunch every day. im still waiting for google earth to have real time satellite view.In the further future, you will be able to touch/taste/hear it i bet. Text>Image>Sound>Feeling   evolution of historical records ;PGoogle Earth already has aerial imagery from 1945 of my home town.Imagine Google Street view from 1917. I'd spend all day on that.I guess that would be around 2105I really wish someone would make a good open source alternative to Google Street view so I can contribute.Time travel1 k commentswhat if we are all npcs in a game of the past (but we are actually IN the future) and we were programmed to believe it is 2017How many hundreds of years?Imagine if we could see hundreds of years ago todayDon't regular maps (from the past) already do that?At first I thought you meant we'd have faster than light travel and we'd be able to look at earth from light years away to see the past.Hundreds of years from now technology will have advanced so much the current imaging technology will be considered so shitty that no one would care.  It is like us finding ancient markings on rocks, impressive for record keeping in the past, but inferior by today's standards.Would be a really cool if they somehow anyhow managed to do this for the past right nowit will be the work of math and computer science algorithm learning to reconstruct the way the streets and doors and everything looked based on compiling and understanding every article every written about how one street looked 180 years ago based on everything on the internet.Flat?If the very fragile network & storage holding it all in place not only remains intact but also remains accessible to future generations. Considering Vint Cerf of Google itself believes we're potentially entering a \"digital dark age,\" it may be worth considering.Google's stated aim: to control the world's information.\n\nFor the future, I imagine them less offering entire views than proffering Google's (or successor of Google's) version. History, victors, same as it ever was. Time to spy on my house hundreds of years before it was built AmazingWait until we either travel through wormholes or develop FTL travel. We'll be able to look on Earth and watch everything unfold from the very beginning.And they will be still looking for their house first. Maybe a bit unrelated, but you can visit Geneva, Street View style, as it was in back in 1850. The site went online 2 weeks ago so there isn't a lot of features as of yet and it's pretty empty, but I read they're planning on expending the content and the interactivity. Still pretty interesting and detailed though. \n\n www.geneve1850.ch WoahThat\u2019s a good shower thoughtAssuming the solar flares don't wipe out Google first!woahArtificial intelligence might be able to do that, it can look at billions of news articles, blog posts, wikipedia pages, and so on to start building a comprehensive timeline of the world.Doesn't this assume google earth will still have relevance in hundreds of years? Google is the AOL of our time, the Bell Service of my dad's time, etc.I was when it was in back in time up to 10 years in the next 20 years lmaoI doubt they are going to keep the dataRemindMe! 7 Years \"Go check google earth\"I worked at blockbuster in my town til 2011ish and it closed down in 2012 I believe. It was demolished and a chick Fil a is there now. But I can totally time travel to 2008 and see where I once worked. My favorite job. It\u2019s awesome. Google street view is going to be nuts in 25-50 yearsI just heard a guy on the radio say the exact same thing not quite an hour ago.\n\nIs he reading reddit or did both of you read it somewhere else? Yup, in hundreds of year. :pGoogle earth is historyI can already see the last time street view buzzed by my house and my neighbor was out remodeling his yard shirtless with lardPeople from the future will have so many more interesting stuff :(\n\nWith the internet They could see what the world and the people were like a long time ago, see their ancestors..r/whoadudeif google were any good they could do it now!I hope historical G Earth doesn't block out facesYou're optimistic about the future!And Bing maps will still do it better.if google still or its maps still existImagine google street view It'll look the same with more condos.The best part is that you just know that at some point there's going to be historians specialized in memes. And one of those guys might read this comment at some point and it will make him think about his life.That is obvious.Not the entire world, but Majority of the worldYou can view how the universe was a long long time ago on Google Sky\n\nhttps://www.google.com/sky/\nThis is stolen content you sir are an assholeI'm an idiot.  Transcript of recent internal dialogue:\n\n\nMe: But how would they... I mean maybe if you were able to send a satellite far enough out... but it'd have to travel faster than the speed light, which maybe one day...\n\n\nSmarter Me:  Wait.\n\n\nMe: Okay.

Two centuries from now or more, it'll be like the holodeck.In the future google earth will be able to show the earth live...so will pictures Gonna take a couple hundred years though.Not sure why zombies (after the apocalypse) would be interested in this unless they could zoom in on people who still had brains...But they'll be a year or two behind just like their Google Maps.When will it be liveThat\u2019s cute. You\u2019re so optimistic. That's before the blackout.  It will be great to use my VR earth set from our colony on the moon following the mass evacuation of 2090. Oh to look fondly at the now dead Blue Marble we once loved. Thanks technology.What seems like a wealth of information to us will feel like a pittance to future generations (unless we *Planet of the Apes* it all first). We've only just begun to stick sensors and chips into everything, to monitor our our household audio with networked devices, to wear glasses with cameras on. In hundreds of years, the current iteration of Google Earth will feel as basic as a hardcover atlas.Too bad we will be dead.A \u201cDoomsday Book\u201d of its time.

Maybe aliens that discover our dead planet can download the images.... If there's a futureAfter WWIII, why would they want to torture themselves with visions of an idyllic past while they inhabit tunnels in a toxic post-apocalyptic world? That is, the elites who were able to build and stock tunnels, and not the surface mutants who actually suffered from the decisions of said elites. I find it funny you think our race will exist hundreds of years in the future.When it was still in one piece.

The format is clinical, describing procedures 'The SCP Foundation' use to Secure, Contain, and Protect anomalous things. Each entry is basically a short story, written as if scientists were writing documentation on the thing in question. \n\nThe whole 'point' of the site is creative writing. There is no standard canon, every entry and story is its own canon, but there are some generally agreed on things. If you want to contribute,  you join and submit an entry or story,  and the moderators decide to post your entry or not. \n\nBefore the question comes up,  the entire site is all licenced to creative commons, meaning,  no you can't make a movie with these, despite how cool it would be. Also, there are similarities between certain entries to well known published creatures,  etc,  but for the most part the mods strive to not let people rip off things.\n\nIf you want to watch weird sci fi/fantasy stuff like SCP, check out cabin in the woods,  stranger things,  warehouse 13 (sort of the PG rated version of SCP), x-files, fringe, and some supernatural episodes(when they aren't hugging demons and fighting angels). \n\nAlso, there is a new YouTube series called Confinement that is animated, and takes a lot from the SCP universe. It currently has 3 episodes out,  the first one [is here](https://youtu.be/v0b2s_ot9_0).  It is pretty funny,  but a lot may go over your head if you haven't read the entries they are referencing. You can see which one they are using in each of the video's descriptions.  \n\nEdit :a word.    \n\nEdit the second: I totally forgot to mention,  the paranoid android, or 'Marvin' is the r/scp bot for linking to scp entries. \n\nIt is a reference to hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. Essentially, it's a world-wide secret organization called the SCP Foundation (SCP standing for both Special Containment Procedures, and Secure, Contain, Protect), they contain anomalous things. Things that don't quite make sense, or possibly they make *too* much sense. There's a lot behind it.https://youtu.be/9AJ1ey-JZ6o?t=9Hopefully they discover /r/nottheonion\n\nAlthough if they don't know what The Onion is in the first place that might not help. Yes.

The problem is more about understanding the formatting of the data itself than understanding the mechanical workings of the drive. A typical hard drive contains gigabytes of proprietary, obfuscated machine code for programs and the operating system designed to run on a very specific CPU architecture. Decoding which data is code and which is actually meaningful information would be extremely difficult without an intimate understanding of the programs used to read those files. And understanding those programs requires an intimate understanding of the operating system, etc.Eh not really.

One end of the box opens to reveal a ribbon, and the wheels make the ribbon move.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ribbon doesn\u2019t seem to come out of the box easily, so it\u2019s probably not intended to be removed. The end of the box probably opens so that you can access it in place. So it seems like this ribbon thing is the important part; the box is there to protect it, and the wheels allow you to access different parts of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why would you want to access different parts of this ribbon? It all looks the same. Maybe there\u2019s more than meets the eye to it. Let\u2019s run some tests.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm, appears that there\u2019s some sort of magnetic pattern encoded on the tape. Let\u2019s work on deciding it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so there are somewhat repetitive patterns going diagonally on the tape.

If you go to historical images on google earth you can see almost every iteration of satellite imagery in most places since the 1970s. Some locations even go back as far as the 1930sIt's legit. The dude in the photo commented in r/Australia and even provided proof. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1c2kde/found_on_google_street_view_south_australia_xpost/c9cr6sh/I was poking around Disney Land in street view and no one's faces are blurred, so it's not 100% of the time.Yeah if Google did that it would take a verrrry long time for them to call/get the contact info of every single person they passBut how much of it is good or prolific? We still watch films like a trip to the Moon and the wizard of Oz and ignore their contemporaries not because they were run of the mill films but because they have qualities that draw in people from many disciplines, historians film makers, writers all come back to them because they set the stage for all films to come. That being said the matrix probably isn't one of them!It certainly is, but all of culture never survives. Shakespeare was incredibly popular even in his day, and there were certainly other playwrights and such around, but his works are remembered. \n\n\nSome truly iconic works from any time period will be remembered to some degree. And given we're talking about naming a google product, it's certainly possible they'd take a name from something old. \n\n\nWe're not talking about some minor film either. It's number 18 on IMDB's top list of films of all time. Obviously it's not a magic vision of the future, but going by other films on that list I think it's a good yard stick for films that will be remembered. \n\nOn top of that it's the go-to reference for \"trapped in a virtual world\" for many people. I can think of other examples, ie, sword art online and such, but that's not nearly as ingrained in the popular thought.I see nothing wrong with this logic. 5/7, perfect explanation.Found Teal'c.My P4 lasts about 20min per charge and that's still the norm afaikYou can already build ones that can last up to about an hour, but if your happy with your platform moving you can make planes that last for 6/7/8 hour flightstuckjohn37 isn't wrong, but you are getting into expensive custom jobs.  I mean the military drones can go for a long ass time.  But if your going to build a platform that's good for a lot of hours, and want any decent coverage of a big enough area, your going to need some high quality optics, and a pretty big platform, and bam you just spent $10k.\n\nThe ones under the $1000 mark, your going to range from 10 to 20 min depending on conditions if it's a multirotor, and 30 to 60 min if its fixed wing.Drones though. Winged flight has a natural lift advantage to keep it afloat for longer. Drones are just bricks with legs.What's a satellite?\"Caps?\"To be fair...that's exactly how it happened.

That would require artificial sentience, which is far, far harder than artificial intelligence. Intelligence is good, it lets us solve problems which humans are bad at due to there being too much data for humans to process or due to there being too many advanced maths for most humans to do quickly. Sentience is bad, because it wastes computational power on thoughts unrelated to the task at hand.\n\nTherein lies the crux of people who are afraid of AI. Convoluting Intelligence and Sapience; an intelligent program can do things which look intelligent but does not have extra bits - they cannot come up with incredibly creative ideas, because it does not think. Sapient programs on the other hand would think... which wastes cycles, and is impressively complex (and thus no-one wants to write the code for it), and is ultimately nearly-useless.o-oh alright...Marvin bot is best bot.[deleted]Yes!

The original pic has no blur. Not even its CGI, its cinemetography and use of bullet-time is where some of its largest influeces were. The story is something that's compelling enough not to vanish from pop culture for quite some time. While the CGI was impressive other films around the same time like LOTR set the benchmark. And as for making sci first popular a trip to the moon fits there and that's not mentioning star wars came out far earlier than the matrix, however I will give it credit for it's use of slo mo, and introducing the red pill/blue pill terminology (both will probably extend past the matrixes relevancy as a movie)My racing ones last 5 min at best My history professor said humans used to drink ice caps.

What do you think pirates had on their treasure maps?You forget the \u201cX\u201d marketing bombardment of the 90\u2019s.You forgot about math, or would they just put a ? instead.Sooo.. \u201cClosing out direct messages\u201d is the meaning behind DMX\u2019s name?[deleted]I would argue that the thing you\u2019re using to close apps isn\u2019t the Letter X, but a symbol or icon. I know that\u2019s a subtle difference but since it isn\u2019t the same typeface I would consider it different... like how the Plus Sign isn\u2019t a \u201ct\u201dUnless you were a teen during the 2000s and used AIM or MSN chat, then you\u2019d see that all your friends had a variation of  this xX_defaultxEdGyxname_Xx as their username. X\u2019s were hot.Notable exceptions:\n\n-Pirates\n\n-Romans\n\n-kids learning multiplication and algebra\n\n-adult video store employees\n\n-cartoon alcoholics\n\n-BasquesThe romans disagree....but they're named Generation XPlaystation: \"It's not an x it's a cross\"General literacy has dramatically increased in that time. So in general people see more letters now. Also if you go back far enough X was commonly used at 10.I don't know man. Porn used to be all \"XXX\". Now it's \"NSFW\". But I see you, baby.IT\u2019s n0t aN x It\u2019S a CR0sSArguable the X to close is a pictogram not the letter. This pictogram meaning closed, barred, forbidden etc likely originates from guards crossing their spears so is actually ancientLooks like X really did give it to us.And then there's American Playstation systems that have X be the confirm button.I need to brush up on my pornography history, but I'm pretty sure XXX rated movies were relatively popular 30 years ago. IDK Maybe that was the 70's. I need to watch more of The Duece on HBO, I'm only on season 1 so no spoilers please The prophecy stated that X was gonna give it to us. And give it to us it hasIt's not an \"X,\" it's a, \"cross.\"Yeah probably.   \nthe x is also because when you close down a program you \"x\"- it.x in mathNot for us Mac users :)Except Hulu.\n\n\nI will legit strangle a member of their design team over that shit.\n\nIf I hit x I mean fucking x.\n\nDon\u2019t minimize the window. \n\nIf your x really means minimize then make it a god damned _What if I told you it was the symbol \u00d7, not the letter x?How did you come up with 100 - 1000? Me, a chef, who looks at food all day then goes home to watch netflix and sleep does not close 100 - 1000 apps or windows per day. Maybe for some but I can't imagine it being representative of the entire population.Also duckfaceNow this is a thought! Nice OC\u201c...It's like X wasn't given enough to do, so they had to promise it more. Okay, you don't start a lot of words, but we'll give you a co-starring role in tic-tac-toe. And you will be associated with hugs and kisses. And you will mark the spot. And you will make writing Christmas easier. And incidentally, you will start xylophone. Are you happy, you fuckin' X?!\u201d\n\nRIP Mitch HedbergUnless you majored in math :(((( y = please kill meand?The X you're referring to is a shape, which predates the Latin letter X by many millennia, and would have been one of the first and most common signs of all human history. For example: the swastika, christian cross, it was even used by people who couldn't write their nameAnd?So whatEspecially me it\u2019s my weld stamp for pressure weldingBecause F pays respect, they probably used F more 75 years ago, than today...Thus Scrabble point assignments are now obsolete.And they say millennials are having less X than previous generationsWe also spend way more time staring at glass than anyone before us ever did.Because we use smartphones to open apps, it\u2019s likely that we see them 100-1000 times more often each day than people did 30+ years ago[deleted]I think you're forgetting about that diagonal X that Christians are so fond of....unless they were pirates\\~Except for the time when X meant \u201csure, I do consent to that Windows 10 upgrade\u201d.Common misconception. It\u2019s actually a \u201ccross\u201d. Welcome to r/PlaystationRoman numerals beg to differ*laughs in math*what about roman numerals bruvCurrent technology and social media make ANY letter 100-1000 times more common. For every program you close, you read at least 3 normal words on that program.\n\nAlthough yeah, words with X are pretty rare, so maybe we see it 1000-10000 times more.Roman numerals mateIdk man, those guys drank a lot of XXX moonshine, I know this because I watched Looney ToonsYeah but that X is a marker for fuckoff Randy and X the letter still isnt that common in writing, fuck X. And fuck X's couchSame with G and google.What about the booty?My name starts with xBut we don\u2019t use x. We use \u00d7. The difference is subtle, but it\u2019s there.Thats' odd. I didn't see my X for a 2 monthsThe letter \u201cx\u201d?? Oh you mean Cross...\nThis comment was brought to you by SonySame with pornWhat about all of those pirates making and staring at treasure maps?!It is actually a multiplication symbol (\u00d7), not an X.I'd wager that since Facebook is about 15 years old, we see the Facebook logo infinity times more often than we did 16+ years ago.Me: Sir, my Scrabble tile holder won't close.\n\nGame Support: \u2026\u2026\u2026..Yeah but would it be considered the letter X or the symbol XSame with #eXcellent observation. and I don't think that you're eXaggerating.The romans have entered the chatWe probably see most letters a lot more because of the internetLike a cross? \ud83d\ude12This is a good one.Arrrgghh I be disagreein' with yeTop comments are all ways in which this showerthought probably isn't accurate but you still got 35k karma.\n\nTotal power move.In the wise words of LL Cool J, \u201cDONT CALL IT A COMEBACK. I\u2019VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS.\u201dWhen no one else is gonna give you the ability to close a program....*Laughs in Mexico.*You forget that I see it more than anyone because x in my brain is annihilate\u201cThe \u2018X\u2019 button is called \u2018CROSS\u2019 and not the English letter\u201d- SonyWe see more letters now, period. More signs, more written media.This... this is a true shower thought! Faith restored.And in math!Aaand x is also a Roman numeral. Maybe they saw it more often than others.according to sony it's just a crossback then most clocks had roman numerals, but it was too hard for the youth to read,,,In fact, there are languages in which the letter X is very uncommon so these guys have a massive overdose of X every day they spend in front of the computerWelp... Rip xxxtentacionI don\u2019t know if it because I\u2019m drunk, but I feel happy for X. It has probably waited for millions of years to be seen, so this is so great. Happyyy!!!!People who were illiterate used to sign their name with an X.\n\nOld historical documents are full of Xs.I don't know about that but... If it weren't for Micro$oft software and their 25 digit product keys, I might have gone my entire life without typing a capital letter Q.People 30yrs ago \" oh my God is that an X I only heard about them in legends\"It's \"cross\" not \"X\"Same thing with the word \u201c[ducking](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Ducking&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CDucking%3B%2Cc0)\u201d. Just look at that usage spike\n\nEdit: that\u2019s a book search, isn\u2019t it. Is it?

Have always thought that was genius.X is also on most video game controllers. I think the SNES was the first.As someone very wise once said, \"the X makes it cool\"The same can be said about buttholes after internet porn. How many buttholes did most people see on average before Internet porn? Maybe a dozen? Two dozen? Not now.I think you might be confusing the letter x with the symbol \u201ccross\u201d.I guess he did it. X really did give it to ya.And because, ya kno, xnxxAnd we see the letter F more times because we pay respects    \n     \nFX-traordinairy!We have to click X to close this postThis is a showerthought.especially on phones , fucking ads.....i should judt use the adblocking browserMuch more. EVERY console controller has an 'X' button...I also heard that it's gonna give it to ya.Great point, let\u2019s make it into an advertising space.I don\u2019t think of the close button as having the letter x on itYou guys all have really cool shower thoughts when I'm in the shower I think about what shampoo to useMost British people put an x at the end of every text, it represents a kiss, sometimes we put xxxxx etc to show how much we love someoneXXX+ years ago? Yeah no Xs then...So i am currently translating Cosmoteer to portuguese (rly good game btw) and the X of that game is literally a string of text that you can translateSo whatIt's a cross, just like on a PlayStation controllerDumb AF. Downvoted this \ud83d\udd3d\ud83d\udd3d\ud83d\udd3d because no one caresMaybe that's why society is ripping itself apart.Bitch please...!!! I have a math degree\ud83d\ude14so I\u2019ve always wondered this: when you close a window, are you doing an \u201cexit\u201d or an \u201cX-it\u201d ?Except piratesIt also appears on both the Xbox and Play Station controller.Funny enough I learned about an old letter today called 'chi'.I see it thrice as much while studyning trignometryI guess \"E\" is no longer the most common letter in the alphabet.I don't see it as a letter X, I see it as a cross.Idk when xxx became a reference for porn but that certainly help your showerthoughtAll the consoles have it!Joke's on you, alt+F4 for life!*laughs in Roman numerals*They're everywhere O-OIt's not an X it's a crossHmmm.... i just see it as a cross: \u274c\n\nNot the letter XX gonna give it to yaNot to mention \"OSX\"X is surely giving it to us  X is completely useless in the alphabet. It should just be a full-time symbolDon't forget Xvideos and XNXXSince the internet and social media that's probably true of every letter.I want some of your weedAccording to Sony I bet it\u2019s a cross not an XI see it more in algebraIf sony has taught me anything that is not the letter X. It is the shape X pronounced \"cross\"And now X is a gender opinion on some state\u2019s drivers licensesi feel like seeing it 1000+ times a day is a little unhealthyYou can see it a few times if you read my name xxxdWindows existed then. But had far less penetration. I\u2019d go back 40 years. MAC was 1984ish?It's not x.  It's CrossIs it a letter? I thought it was a symbol.What about ancient Roman accountants?But less than ancient Romans did, maybe?Don\u2019t forget all those xxx videos.  That\u2019s a lot of XThe decline in Castlemaine XXXX adverts to me has probably reduced the amount I see it.Don't forget that a hundred years ago illiterate people signed their name on official documents with an X.I see \u00d7 not.xCould 'X' move up in most common letters because of this? Could it overtake the infamous 'E'?Idk Xs are used to mark a lot of things, but I see where you're coming from. It probably is a lot more but Idk about 1000x lolI don't think it's the letter \"X.\" I think it is an X shape.We also \u201ccheck\u201d boxes with the letter XActually it's a cross.What about pirates?Nice to know how the times have changedDon't forget if you're in any post-7th grade math classYou people close your windows?Umm... okay???Roman numerals would like a word.People who didnt know how to read used to draw an X for their signature.  Hell Pirates saw more Xes than your average Mac user.Exit also sounds like \u201cX\u201d itUnless you were a pirate. X always marked the gold in the mapBesides treasure hunters obviously.30+? Does that also means a lot more than 30 years? then, dont forget about roman numerals. Quite large of the non modern buildings has year of construction in roman numerals.\n\nAlso if somebody could not write their signature they would use xxx instead.\n\nThis is maybe neglegable since you want see so much text then, but if we normalize it to the number of letters seen it could be not that unusual as you think.X is also used in X-ing or \u201ccrossing\u201d which is a relatively common street sign.*laughs in maths*Also algebraOkayWho else just went and looked at all the X's on their screen?And xxx?It\u2019s probably gotten a lot more mileage on journalists\u2019 keyboards thanks to BrexitThat was once the number 10, so I'm sure it was pretty common.Also the letter V\n\nAnd if you use reddit, Fbut like how many circles do you see everywhere? We counting those as Os? Every cup, every emoji face, every phone camera, those are all Os. Gotta be way more than XThis is the dumbest shower thought I've seen so farDoes it count since you're not using it as a letter? It's more a symbol (although the letter is also a symbol) in this use than pertaining to the alphabet.Not if you were a really fucking succesful treasure hunter.Don't get started on /, #, @ and other symbols.This sub should be renamed r/Okay?We also see more frequently the tops of everyone\u2019s heads, then ever before.Forgetting the old timey booze bottles.It's not the letter, it's the shape\n\nA square and a dash aren't lettersMath, i do math all day every day. In addition to x we also use the greek alphabet so lots of arcane symbols are used.Car models a land brand drug names are loaded with Xs. People have seen plenty of them for a whileX to doubt \n\n(No, you\u2019re probably right)Holy fuckxExcept for xylophone fanatics30 years ago all people still had XXX films.Doubt [ X ]Is it the letter X which closes windows, or a symbol which looks like an X?\n\nI'm not sure it's a letter in this context. Just like it's not really a hyphen which minimizes windows. Or the letter \"O\" which does... whatever the circle does on Macs.I use x mainly for math.so your showerthought is safe butIs it weird that I think of that as a symbol I colloquially call \"the x\"and not the letter? Even though I call it \"the x\" because it looks like the letter.What kind of weird-ass showers are you taking?What about my home buttonIt's not the letter X, it's the symbol \u00d7!it's not x, it's \u00d7It was chosen by MS originaly, when they put in a drop down menu the option to e**x**it where the X was underlined for quick access. It became the standard in most apps, but you can see for example some Apple apps still use the red button insteadTell that to the romansWildExcept maybe the romans..What?!?! You see a letter on the close icon? That's a cross, son, not an \"x\". We just shorten it with the letter x when we write it down.Malcolm XI mean, from staring at virtual and physical keyboards half the day we probably see all letters a lot more often.It's not an \"x\", though. It's a cross.I think you discount the popularity of Family Feud and how it would display how often your team had gotten the wrong answer.Mathematicians didn't exist in 1980s and priorI never really look at the \"X\". I just drag the cursor to the top right corner and click.Don\u2019t forget about the letter x in algebrawhat about mathematiciansAre we sure it isn't the Roman numeral X?How did this get so many upvotes? I dont ever use x on my phone ever. Is this the mandela effect at work again?Is it an X or a cross? Is there a difference?It's not the letter \"x\". It is a 'cross' (as in tick vs cross)I use \ud83d\udd35, \u2b1b or \ud83d\udd3a for all my appsYeah but it's not really the LETTER X, but the symbol. Technically they're different things.Except for maybe the age of Pirates. Yarr!  \n\n\nI would argue that staring at the same \"x\" on a treasure map is akin to staring at the same \"x\" on your gui.Speak for yourself, I don't work with computers on a daily basis. I just play games on them.Not for the basquesMathOne word for you 'Treasure Maps'To stop a Jamaican ghost (duppy) from following you, an X is inscribed on the ground and since duppys can't count to ten, it stands transfixed at the inscription.But still less than they saw it MMXXXI years agoNot x. Cross.Ancient Romans may disagreeX was shorthand for christ for like hundreds of years.What about @? Do you remember how odd it looked back in the early days (of this crap we call the internet)?Nah, man. That's not the *letter* X, it's the *shape* X.Explain to me how you came up with the 100-1000 rangewe are so surrounded by technology, i think we see every letter 1000x times.It is also the multiplication symbolIPhoneX?\nYou mean IphoneClose.[Common theme on my reddit feed today](https://i.imgur.com/xS3x04T.jpg)Sorry bud. Windows 1.1 came out in 1988. You're a year and some change late. That's when the x to close was introduced. See * Windows Presentation Manager*Yeah. That's whyI normally just Alt + F4 so the application doesn't stay as a background task. If you close out of steam the traditional way and then turn off your computer, sometimes steam won't open once you turn it back on.

Showerthought inceptionDMX is what happens to my messages on dating apps.I found [this](https://medium.com/re-form/x-to-close-417936dfc0dc) medium post that explores the origins of \n \"X\" as the symbol for \"close\".\n\nAs far as I can tell, it either came from an early Atari or NeXT OS and was possibly an element borrowed from Japanese culture, specifically the concepts of batsu, symbolized with an X and maru, symbolized with an O. Batsu can represent false, bad, wrong, or leave/exit.I've been a programmer for almost 11 years and it has never occurred to me that I had no idea why \"X' represented \"close\". Maybe because of \"eXit\"?I heard that they asked 100 people, and our survey said...\n\n#XI always thought it was because youd cross something out by striking through diagonally twice.[This article](https://medium.com/re-form/x-to-close-417936dfc0dc) offers a few possibilities.

It's a good read with a lot of images that took me back into my childhood...eXit.Billy told me his big brother in 7th grade said \"exit\" was shorted to \"x it\" so then it becomed an xThe medium article I posted generally concedes it to be an icon, so in that respect, I agree. But how often have you heard someone say \"ex out of it\" when closing a program or app. And as far as the plus sign  I also agree. But take a cross out of a church and put it anywhere else and I see a t...In web development we use the character \"&times\" to draw a multiplication sign as a button to close modals.

X is short for 'Exit' as in \"Exit Program\"\n\n'Close' didn't become common parlance with computers until Windows had been around for a bit, as you could now exit a program by \"closing the window\"Crossing something out has existed for a long ass time man.I'm not positive, but this may also go back to Windows 3.1, when there were single-letter shortcuts.  Since E was already used for Edit, Exit became X (eXit) instead.r/UnexpectedSteveHarveyYeah, I thought so as well. Similar to warning signs like \u2018no smoking\u2019 or \u2018end of highway\u2019this is my perception as well. Anyone here over the age of 50 who can tell us if X ing over something was a common way of indicating elimination prior to computer applications?It's not even a X though, it's just a cross. This is like saying that the symbol for minimizing a window is _ so we spend our days seeing underscores.It was on windows 3.11 at leastWell argued.Funny enough, in Dutch we often mention the close icon as the Dutch word for 'cross', not the letter 'x'. So for us, you could say that we do say 'click on the cross'.Never heard 'ex out of it' which is weird considering that from these comments it seems to be very commonI don't hear people say \"click the x\" or \"x out of it\" people tend to say \"close the window\" or some such. I always thought it was a cross like a tick is accept/correct and a cross is....don't....accept/incorrect.ex out of it is most likely not referring to the letter X, but rather \"Exit\"At 35 I'm far enough removed from when I learned it that I'll just agree with you instead of trying to remember any details of calculus.Or algebra.It's well known the ancient romans had no love for that goose game.And the Vita.\n\nYeah, turned out I got a Japanese Vita and the sellers claimed that every Vita had X as cancel and Circle as Confirm.

You try again with a slight variation. Perhaps you add a number or underscore if that's allowed. But you can imagine how for some of the more popular names even that isn't enough and gets silly fast. So you turn to adding letters. Out of all the letters on the alphabet x and z are quite reasonable at first.\n\n\nxLegolas isn't that silly.

For some reason.I remember them mostly on MySpace and CODIt originally meant you were straight edge. At shows where there was a bar underage people would get an x sharpied on their hand at entry. Straight edge people started to show up to shows with x on their hands already and that\u2019s why the letter X was so prevalent in the hardcore scene which later bled into the emo scene.*awkwardly tugs on shirt collar*How scandalous!Nah much older.\n\nI fondly remember xXSephiroth420Xx back circa 2007.Which one?

Still......he means using x as a variableI like parenthesis for clarity, though less brevity, but yeah. X is a variable, not a multiplication symbol.Dot can be confused with dot product so its best to assign constants to symbols and put em next to each other without anything in between.> In the UK we've been using variables and haven't moved to dots yet. \n\nSo you don't use x as the most common letter for a variable? Like a linear function for you is not y=ax+b?r/urtalkingaboutvernonkayWeird. It\u2019s been so long I\u2019m sure I could just misremember it allOr you could just double-click that button.It's the same in Swedish, we also call the x symbol a cross (which, interestingly, isn't the same word we use for a cross in a church).I think in Finnish we call it \"rasti\", which refers specifically to the shape X.I think it's both. Some people will say \"exit out of the program\" which could be misinterpreted as \"x it out the program\" and then propagated as \"x out of it\". That's at least my hypothesis.Fun fact, the derivative of that function is ALSO 2 x.It's in my subconscious somewhere.But that isn't actually relevant to calculus; that's just a carryover of \"x\" being the first variable name you use in any algebra.But why is the rum gone??That's Doctor Roxxo's territoryAre you sure you didn't mean extra-sea.com?

So from the start of the first year, we already call it year one, and when exactly one year has passed, it'd be year two. Due to this, at Dec 31st 100 A.D. it's the end of the century, and Jan 1st 101 A.D. is the start of the second century.\n\nThus, in jan 1st 2001 the 21st century started.\n\nThe reason there is no year 0 is due to the fact that in 525 A.D. when the B.C. and A.D. systems were invented by some monk, he used Roman numerals, in which the concept of 0 doesn't excistFunny thing is that I have a degree in physics and I completely forgot about variablesYeah, fun fact actually is that if you actually understand how integrals work, the dx doesn't need to be put there, and it's actually left off in most analysis classes. Though it can be useful for illustrating Jacobian/transformations/substitutions. \n\n\"Easy\" explanation is that Int(f(x),x) means the same thing as Int(f(u),u), since the variables are called \"bound variables,\" or effectively ranging or iterative variables, with an analogy to programming, where the sum of all x up to 10 is the same as the sum of all u up to 10. \"Harder\" explanation is understanding some deeper measure theory or analysis.\n\nThink I tried explaining it to my calc teacher once, and he probably \"got it\" but just didn't want to deal with the heresy.the entire royal navy>!Like This?!<.

We celebrated the beginning of the 19th century in 1801, but the start of the 21st century in 2000. I wasn't able to determine whether the start of the 20th century was celebrated in 1900 or 1901.\n\nAlso, to my knowledge the first human civilisation to have a number for 0 was the maya.I mean it's just one of those things that's so obvious it can be easy to forget aboutWell it's ok to forget, since when you get into the sciences their variables actually stand for something instead of always using the ambiguous x.

This zero however was used in counting, like the zero in 1025, and not like the 0 between -1 and 1. The Egyptians, other mesopotamian civilizations and I believe the greeks also used zero.\n\nThe Mayans used the 0 indeed, a few years BC they started using it, I don't however know whether they used it as between -1 and 1.\n\nThe Indians were the first in the old world to use 0 as between -1 and 1, as well as introducing negative numbers. which slowly spread to China, the Islamic world and slowly to Europe.\n\nthe first documented English use of 0 (That I know of) was in the 16th century.And also that physics tends to use more named variables, like a = acceleration, and v = VelocityTrue but the other person made me remember how in the more theoretical physics subjects, they just use x's with different subscripts to refer to different positionsxXBoxOneXxWhat an **X**treme name!xX_H0R5\u20ac_W4NK3R_Xxr/yourjokebutworser/subsididntfallforor x for position.....dee equals vee-eye-tee plus one half eh-tee-squared \n\n\nNailed itThat\u2019s because there\u2019s like 5 different dimensions and shit gets crazy trying to represent it all with just w, x, y, zxXcumlordXxOh, so *you\u2019re* the one that nabbed that username before I could.my 14 year old ('97) self feels attacked.r/subredditsashashtagsr/substoolongtobearealsubRight... about that...Thought x was for horizontal  displacementIt could be s tbf...",

Typically gold miners, but also others.\"This is not what I expected when you said you would go deep.\"am marine biologist, don\u2019t even get laid at ground levelThe 20,000 Leagues LeagueIt almost never happens. Men have trouble performing under pressure.As above, so belowSubmarine crews Deep down Mariana's trenchI work underground at the local mines. I actually met my loving gf there. I can't say where or what mine but we have had sex underground. It was 4000 feet underground where we did it.\n\nNot quite a mile but we did it underground, surface and on a plane. That's a personal accomplishment.\n\nEdit- I've never gotten so much internet points being here over 7 years lol Thank you!There's a middle of the ocean club.(Thanks Navy!) So this seems like it could be legit.The mile deep club.That explains James Cameron's obsession with diving.... If Brazzers doesn't make this a thing, nothing makes sense anymoreI don't know about marine biologists, but divers/diving instructors have a 10m, 20m and 30m club. Trying to get your dick hard at 30m is next to impossible.My friend was on a research vessel in the Pacific this summer, and apparently a lot of scientists were hooking up out there. I'd believe itThere are caves that go below 1 mile in depth(deepest is over 2000m down). I know a few cavers who are in the 1k down club but it's a serious effort to get that low... I'm certain there are some in the mile deep club just for the tick box though when they say \u201csea madness\u201d they mean \u201csea hormones\u201d\n\npeople get horny as hell when stuck on bessels together. The \"Going Down\" club.It\u2019s called the 150ft club. It\u2019s a real thing divers do but it\u2019s not easy. Your body doesn\u2019t move quickly under water and your scuba equipment gets in the way What's the height record; have any astronauts had sex?In the divecenter in Australia I worked for it was called \"Club 10\" if you do it on a SCUBA Dive.\n\nWe had a couple one day naked at the dive deck in full gear... they even announced it... was weird being the lookout on deck that dayThey gotta. Because of the implication...I heard that loads shot while under a lot of ocean pressure increase speed and distance of the load by 38%I'd imagine the sex is\n\nSub-parI wonder if submariners ever get busy.There was that guy who brought a reporter down on his sub then raped her, murdered her, and scuttled his boat. Astronauts.Someone has unlocked Dark Iron Dwarves...You'd need to stoop to a new low to get into that club!It's called the hundred metres club. Only cowgirl works because any other position tangles scuba lines. The Mile Below Club. For that deeper connection.Gives new meaning to getting the bendsDon't forgery the 220 mile high club. There have been more than a dozen astronaut couples sent up to the ISS. Submarines are always full of seamenI can't fathom why not.Oh god the puns in this thread are beyond believableImagine the smell in that small 2 person sub.....*Jotaro Kujo wants to know your location*Mile below club is called being a Navy submariner[deleted]Hard to perform down there.  Too much pressureIs this a just cause fan? Alas, no, probably not. A mile is far beyond any ambient pressure diving - the very deepest saturation dives are only about half that, and those were dry dives done in a chamber, so it will need to be done in some atmospheric diving vessel. Likewise, a mile is beyond the crush depth of the vast majority of submarines. Something roomy like a Los Angeles class sub is only going to get you to about 800ft or so, and the Seawolf is only going to get you about twice that.\n\n\nNo, you're going to need a deep submergence vehicle, a DSV. Most deep sea craft are ROVs, and there are very few manned craft that can go that deep. Those are generally for the military, and I suspect that they are your only option if you want enough space to get it on - most civilian DSV's are incredibly cramped, and generally freezing cold. I refuse to believe no one has had sex on the iss.There's also the mile ahead club.  \nIt's when you have sex behind a Cracker Barrel billboard.Great thought, but your username can politely fuck right off.Divers do it deeper!And spelunkers. And Spelunkersare you seriously telling me you had the chance to say \"mile deep club\" and didnt use it?It's not gay if it's underway.If life were a game, it would be an achievement to have sex on land, in air, and underwater.Where we're going we won't need a cock pump.Or a mile to the side club for flat earthers The marine version is sleeping with the fishes.\nHey /u/TacoBellIsGrossSober,\n\n\nThis is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.Baby it's better\nDown where it's wetter\nUnder the seaaaSubmariners fuck.\n\nSource: Fucking submariner.And then there are [these guys](https://youtu.be/jEX0r9cs5_0)It\u2019s mostly just homeless people and C.H.U.D.S.What happens below sea level, stays below sea level There isn't BTW STANLEY: Lemme explore dat Mariana Trench, baby.\nPAULINA: Not with that bathysphere you ain\u2019t. I\u2019m in both. Many times. And of course they can say no but they\u2019re not gonna say no because of the implication. or naval submariners.10/10 Atm, would bang. And a *mile deep* club, for those who have sex with op's momIdk. I feel the pressure of it all would be too overwhelming You misspelled submariners...What about miners and other people that work underground? I know that there were both men and women working underground in a uranium mine in northern Saskatchewan, Canada in the early 1980\u2019s.Haha that song under pressure just popped into my head reading this. Ron White has a Mile Ahead Club.  You have to have sex under a Cracker Barrel sign.We have the mile long club. -freight train conductor If you live in Colorado is basically already mile high Oh god... why would you want to put your penis inside of a coworker?It\u2019s called the 100 feet club. Having sex 100 feet below sea level. Somewhat dangerous 1 mile down is seriously deep, only a handful of research missions would ever get that far. The majority of military subs are 500-800 feet. \n\n\nI was surprised that nobody had mentioned this and that every top response is a shitty joke, then remembered this is reddit.Probably not. A mile down is bad for pressurized vessels.  \nIt ain\u2019t gay if you\u2019re under way!Probably more likely to be those poor chaps in nuclear submarines. may as well be gay for the stay \n\n&#x200B;It's called 69'000 leagues below the seaIt doesn't seem like a lot of fun to be fucking under a lot of pressure.There's also a half mile high club where you get fingered in line for the lavatoryI have heard of the 100 foot club where scuba divers get it on underwater. Only cowgirl though due to the scuba gear.I'm just still trying to join the normal club How many are happy with just 6 feet under club?It's really just a bunch of sailors masturbating in a metal tube.That's a lot of pressure to performWanna go down? For scuba divers it\u2019s called Atmosphere 33. I assume it\u2019s called that because 33 feet of salt water exerts 1 atmosphere. I have not tried this, but my scuba instructor told me him and his wife would frequently do this. They would use extra weights to help hold them down. Of course this seems okay to do in tropical water but I can\u2019t imagine  doing this in any other setting. I would definitely not recommend trying this out for safety reasons. Am I the only person who remembers the one episode of Futurama where Fry and Leela almost hook up underground but the professor says there is no timeI like how you chose biologists and ocean explorers instead of just saying submariners taking turns each other. \"Oh no, explosive depressurization!\"\n\n*nuts*Don't forget the navy and submarine sexAlso scoops divers There's also a mile off club, to which many a young male redditor belongs.There is actually a club like that for divers, it's called the 100 meter club. Don't know about mile below...but there is a100ft club that SCUBA divers can try to join.Thanks for the upvotes my friends. First time getting to front page. Have to say, the inspiration came from eating mushrooms and watching that movie with Dwight schrute called \u201cthe meg\u201d last night. If anyone could help me figure out a way to analyze the growth of the post over the time after submitted, I would be very appreciative!Underground miners... Yeah, like that one psycho that chopped up a woman in his sub. There is. Ask anyone who's worked on a naval sub.What about submarine crews? You know,  because gay?Channel Tunnel club member checking in!Doubt it. All the women would be smart enough to stick with stuff like wrenches and other things you can findBelow what? Sea level? If would want to go somewhere one mile below any surface you could just go to the Grand Canyon where some stretches are one mile deep. Its called the mile and 6 inches in the earth club And miners! There's plenty of deep mines out there.What's the name for the clubs for outer space and other planets?Cheeky bastard. Submarine? Guaranteed gonna be full of Sea-Men.Famed Deep Sea Explorer James Cameron was likely the first.Thanks for the ideahmm....Most submarines are only capable of a few hundred meters of depth. Deeper than that could collapse them because of the enormous pressure at depth. Or the biggest population of under the sea people. The us navy. Submarine people. I\u2019m sure they have a very risqu\u00e9 club. I'd call it \"mile-deep\". Oh, right, I see. When you said you wanted me to go down, I didn't realise you meant in the subDeep throat I'm almost certain there is, and that it's a society/societies of geologists/biologists who study deep trenches and the life existing in them. It's most likely small parts of different bodies who use their research as a cover for their plans to take over the above world.\"Going ... down?\"Where's the sauce?James Cameron. Sealab 2021I believe Johnny Deeper accomplished this decades agoI can't even get into the mile middle club The 30m or 100ft club for scuba divers.Everyone in Denver is part of the mile high club, except redditors of course.I just realised I've never even jerked off in a plane. Or did I? I can't remember, I've probably never even jerked off in a plane.Bitch I\u2019d fuck a fish I've fucked in the ocean, surely it counts.   The real question is who's done it in orbit? The sea was angry that day my friends.\"Miles under\" sounds betterNow I get it doms and subs What about the 205 to 270 mile-high club.....? \u0ca0_\u0ca0And that's why they call me the eel manIn scuba diving there is a tradition of doing your 100th dive naked. The only person in it is James CameronAnd everyone can smell itNah the mile below club is in my basement and I've unlocked that achievement ages ago.Submariners, too....can you imagine the smell they all must have to tolerate?Yeah I think the navy boys started that trend... By time I got this wetsuit off, I'd already have surfaced.You forgot about coal miners. \u201cThe sea was angry that day, my friends.\u201dThis is the most pun-filled post I've ever read. Good job Reddit. More like Sailors. It's a Navy thing. That's where gay subs come from.Extreme sex. Make that a show now please?Is this sub just rehashing old jokes/ making the laziest puns ever?Its called the 100ft club and its for divers that have sex at least 100 ft below the surface.There **is** a mile under club. Underground mining.And the Navy too. The Love Below or so its called.The sub club I love that band..It's called the NavyGet your mind out of the trench, enjoy some space station lovin'.Had a GF once while i was  a scuba Instructor  in a small Shop on Utila.  On off days we would head out on kayaks to the diferent dive spots  and do specialities like wrek, deep or or cave diving.   Fun times I jacked off on a plane once. I can imagine given the chance I'd do the same in a submarine Ahem... Forgetting about the navy?Is there a mile long club? For really long trains? Hot girls are few and far between down there, but you can find a few diamonds That\u2019s a lot of pressure.The opposite of high is low\n\nAbove / BelowWhat\u2019s space sex gonna be called?  The lightyear club?\n\nI know it\u2019s not remotely close to a lightyear but most plane sex happens many dozens of miles in the air so all the name needs to be is something that sounds cool and people agree on \n\nOr, to modify Frank Reynolds suggestion, the *Space* Sex Society? lolI work in an underground mine and there very much is a \"hard Rock\" club[deleted]Having lived in Colorado high country, I was a top member of the mile high club. [deleted]My diving instructor in Thailand told me they have a 10 meter club.SCUBA divers have a 100 foot under club raised a caver, inactive for five years now, but I can firmly state, there are people humping below your feet if you live in any area with a cave. I've never had the opportunity, but I know some folks who have. There's a 100ft club.It's called the Navy.As someone studying marine biology, fuck yes, I hope so.sex in a submarineYeah, it's called \"being isolated and lonely\".\n\n\nSame thing for truckers and sailors. It's not pretty.In the marine world there are no miles or clubs, only leagues.It's called the 100m club. It very much exists.I sure as shit hope this existsIt's the \"Bust a Nut/Get the Bends\" club.I'm in the high-jackers clubIf they don't have one already. All profits are mine It gives a whole new meaning to the term \"getting the bends\".https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnn.com/travel/amp/lovers-deep-submarine/index.htmlUsed to work underground, it wasn't a mile, but a good 400m+...You've been reading too much Clive Cussler.Not very likely, if your subterranean location requires that you be suited up and sealed so that you don't die... Maybe cavers would be the exception, but not even extreme cavers. A mile below the surface of either land or water is life threatening territory, and hardly the place where you'd be considering a quickie. That said, maybe there's a 50 meter club.It\u2019s called the Mile Deep ClupI think the Navy has this well under control...SOMA game taught me it's wet and dark down there.I\u2019m still trying to join the sea level clubPeople don't commute under the ocean. I don't think you're thinking that one through. OP, did you happen to see Down Periscope?I know this is meant to be humorous but there is such a thing for SCUBA divers called the 100 ft club.Military submariner guy here. Can confirm. Lots of sex. Mile Below Club. \nRecently with women!At those pressures?It's called the 100ft club. Divers go down to 100ft below, do the dirty, and come back. No time for foreplay at that depth.\"It ain't that deep bruh\"Just ask any submariner.  It's not gay if it's underway Wouldn't it be a better pun like...\nLucky league below?That would definitely be called the 20 Leagues Club. As above, so below.Some scuba divers actually do this. Also they do a naked dive when they hit 100 dives.Well, there's not. So you're safe. No one will ever know your \"secrets\".Submarines are often full of seamenMinors?A bunch of people in a small container for weeks? There's definitely been at least some fucking.\n\nSome submariners have definitely joined already. Bell divers too.https://youtu.be/nmGuy0jievsThe mile down clubIt\u2019s disappointing to realize that if you are just at ground level then it\u2019s just called \u2018club\u2019. \n\nI mean, really. Who calls it club?Just thinking of all them seamen on the submarines....alone for months at a time....in the deep deep blue....There is also the mile long club.\n\nSex on a train.James Cameron FucksWouldn't it be mile low?nuts\"Deep ocean\" =w=Can confirm... This is likely a possibilityIIRC there is something called the 100 under club. Extremely dangerous but people do it. Takes deep sea diving to a whole new levelShhWhen you finish your head explodesAnd gay submarine crewmen. Yare yare dazeThere is a kilometre high club for Euro flyers.Out of the groups that live under the water why weren't submariners at the top of this list. A bunch of Randy bastards. I'd just call it mile low. Instead of below.we measure it in meters.

I mean what else can you expect with a bunch of seamen packed in a long narrow tube below the surface?There's a South Pole club with a pretty high membership believe it or not.Well someones gonna fucks a dolphin. I wonder if there's ever been any space whoopie. Seems like it'd be tough to get the right leverage. And a 15 ft high club for trains. \n\nSource: used to work for railroadDon't forget boring company employees.Kilometer in water clubWanna look into my porthole ? Most submarines cant go deeper than 2000 feet so no.And James CameronI've taken a dump underwater, but never sex.Have you been on a submarine? Shit's crammed. A CRJ 200's lavatory is fitter for sex than a submarine, and the CRJ200 has tiny lavatoriesAnd, you know... all those boys who work on submarines. Arent \"if,then\" posts against the rules???I just go balls deepSomething something secret societyI thought about this when 3200 ft deep in a mine in Saskatchewan for a job recentlyIs there a club for those who have mated in Antarctica? There's also the meter high club for trains, it's probably one of the least exclusive clubs though\"100' club\" scuba divers go down 100' for the express purposes of doing it.then there's the 254 mile high club When I was getting my advanced diving certification I heard about something like this.  They call it the Hundred Foot Club.  As the name suggests, you dive down to 100 ft, bang it out, and come back up.  Remember kids, always practice safe Scuba Sex.  Leave yourselves time for a 2 min safety stop at 10ish meters before surfacing.Navy submariners hmmmDon\u2019t forget the spelunkers. Or mole men.I wonder if elevation factors in to how much sperm comes out.Is it even possible for one to get deep enough for this, either in a vessel, or while free diving?JoIn ThE NaVyA much more exclusive clubNaked dives :)I'm sure gold diggers fall under that categoryDont forget diggers and miners![deleted][deleted]Can confirm. I work in the mines in Australia. It's not uncommon for people to get it on underground... particular in dump truck cabs \ud83e\udd14That's fucking gold right there It's only for golddiggers, though. \"It just looks small because it's highly pressurized\"\u201cThis is not what *I* expected when you said you\u2019d go down on me.\u201dDon\u2019t tell a woman you wanna see her Mariana Trench\"Your depth perception must be wayy off\"Don't worry, there are plenty of fish in the sea.

That'll have you drowning in poon.[deleted]Impressive that you are a cop, a marine biologist and a forensic scientist fApparently you\u2019re also a cop and a forensic scientist...jotaro, if you got help with that ptsd it would helpIt took me ages (and someone explaining it) for me to realise that the 20,000 leagues referred to the distance travelled under the sea, not the depth under the sea.\n\nI was thinking \"bloody hell Verne, how thick are you - even the Mariana Trench is only a couple of leagues deep\"Where do I know the phrase 20000 leagues? It's on the tip of my tongue >->Under Pressure by Queen (and David Bowie) starts playing.

The only subs that were even capable of diving to around half a mile were made by soviets and never made it into a series because it was too expensive to make them.There\u2019s definitely far more gay guys than anything else in this club GaaaaayI just really hope there is a couple of scientists one of whom is named Mariana who have made this joke.So, is it better than sea level?Have we?  I'm sure I'd remember something like that.The nautical mile club ?Back in my windsurfing days living in Key West we had the \"mile out\" club. This was still in longboard times, so enough buoyancy for two. If a boat did happen to come by, you could just slip into the sea. The Sea Level Society?This sounds like something someone made up to get laid.It\u2019s not gay if it\u2019s underway!Pretty widespread club, hell, even I've slept with op's mom.   /s\n\nEdit: if no /s, people wouldn't know that I was \"/satisfied\" with the experience. Also she made damn good meatloaf...op is a lucky guy.I've always wondered if he had a wank while at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.James Cameron doesn\u2019t do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. James Cameron does what James Cameron does because ~~he is~~ James Cameron is James Cameron https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0napnfxd-dUIt would be cool to see that bold guy with all possible educations as a marine biologist. Help out the hot assistant because she had a medical problem (cut her finger or something) and then meta out the script and say that he\u2019s a licenced doctor and wink at the camera. And then do adult stuff to her around the submarine.I can confirm. I met my girlfriend on an Oceanographic Expedition and have several friends who met their spouses aboard the ship. Can also attest to their being a small contingent of members of the mile down club in the deep submersible Alvin.On the vessel I have no doubt, in the submersible is much less likely though.Yeah, your mum is the caveI never had that problem, but I always studied math aloneYeah, I came here to say this. I know a fair few diving instructors and they all try to have sex underwater.Salt water in the hooha does not sound like fun. Do you think NASA would actually send a married couple up into space together? >![They Did](http://time.com/4218472/astronaut-couples-valentines-day/)!<There's a ban on sex in the ISS, apparently, but it could well have happened. I'd be surprised if it hasn't happened at least once, if not on the ISS then on one of the shuttle missions. Neil Armstrong has children, so I'm guessing that's a yes.No they only hire virgins, otherwise they'd have to face the whole 'spunk in space' conundrum or face a sticky old sputnik surprise in the rockets.That\u2019s an oddly specific number100 men go down 50 couples come up. Obviously. Oh yeah!!! What was his name? I just heard about that case.That's the 62 mile high club.There is a lot of info on it actually. It\u2019s pretty impossible without gravityI can gurantee all of your down votes are by people who have never been underway on a sub. You know, cuz they can take jokes...and other things *wink wink nudge nudge*Ah, a proponent of the ol' chunnel chub. Nice work. I\u2019m assuming op meant below sea level. The grand canyons rim starts at like 7000 feet elevation so you could technically join the mile high club.Lmao what's this from?Now I ain\u2019t sayin she a gold miner but she ain\u2019t messing with no...\n\nSilver mining?\n\nSigh... \ud83d\ude14 Untrue.

I dont see a single reference to marine biology until this last comment they made in anyway shape or form.

Now I feel dumb tooTo be fair, the spanish title is in your face about it \"20,000 leagues of submarine travels.\" For real?[deleted]Shit, now I realize it myself too! Always thought it was the depth. Also 20000 leagues is 7.6 x the diameter of the Earth.I avoided embarrassment because the Danish title (I\u2019m danish obviously) is \u201cEn Verdensomsejling Under Havet\u201d, which would translate into something like \u201csailing around the world under the sea\u201d - there\u2019s no distance in the title to misunderstand.Read that in Ernest P.

And I was born when Nixon was president. https://streamable.com/bf8fSNL did a skit about just that a while back.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/4cg4dn/kelsey_grammer_captain_nemo_20000_leagues_under/ Jules Verne?it's a very little known book title.There's a museum in Croatia (I forgot where... maybe Dubrovnik), where there's an exhibit on deep sea life, and the large pressures they live under. In the exhibit, Under Pressure is played on loop and they have paintings on the walls of Freddie Mercury as a fish. Here's [some proof.](https://imgur.com/a/StKx6y2)Ahem Queen AND David BowieExcessive internal moisture. Alarms sound. Cabin pressure failure. Blood begins to boil in veins. Tongues swell.

Nah. The COB (senior enlisted onboard) and a female midshipman (Naval Academy rider) got caught messing around a few years back. Most of deep sea exploits involve loading jellyfish into our patrol sock at test depth.I worked on the Alvin sub replacement project, albeit for about a week. It was my first week into a government project. I was irritated that Lockheed was making the control system from scratch (lots of off the shelf commercial solutions do similar things) but the problems to be solved are enormous. Titanium spheres 9 feet in diameter and 6 inches thick. Foam for flotation that can withstand thousands of feet of water pressure. Tungsten emergency drop weights to maximize ballasting weight while minimizing the drag coefficient.  And on and on.  I believe it is probably more difficult to go to the bottom of the ocean than go into space. But submarines have gone that deep and just not returned. So who is to say no hanky Panky got on while they were waiting for death to take them.

It is like learning someone had sex in Ecto 1 or that train they used for  the live action Thomas movie.This only furthers my conclusion regarding commonly accessible, especially government owned, furniture. If your office has a couch, assume people have had sex on it.\n\nI know it's not a submersible, but if people are getting it on undah da sea, I'm sure they are elsewhere.Agreed. The interiors are tiny.Oof.Nerdiest joke everPlease sir I just came here for diving instructionDo you think it's waterproof when not having sex?https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/space-sex-is-serious-business/amp/ Do you really think married people are more likely to have sex?There was less privacy on most Space Shuttle missions than on a city transit bus. Maybe some of the Spacelab missions might have added a door or corner that could be ducked behind, but generally there was no way to do it on the Shuttle except in full view of the rest of the crew. On modular space stations like Mir and the ISS though it's actually possible to be in a different module from everyone else for an extended period of time.That's how you know it's a real statistic. It's actually 48 couples and a pair of prizefighters.Ok. But would you agree that someone tried anyway?Go to the rim boom mile high, go down into the canyon boom mile below lol.

I can see why there needs to be consequence there, there is a lesson to learn.\n\nI still think that sacking them is a bit of a rough punishment though. Theres always the chance neither if them will ever be able to make each other pregnant when they are ready.When I worked in a mine, not wearing the proper PPE was a serious offence. If it happened in a refuge location that means it was during an emergency situation. I can understand the firing.Wearing PPEs is typically not required when eating or waiting in a refuge chamber. I don't think they could have used that reason to dismiss them. In what region is your mine located? Maybe policies are different in other countries.There's no rules on PPE in refugee stations.I would imagine it's probably hard to concentrate with Steven Tyler humming in the background.Now we've got the low down about doing it on the down low down under.\u201cLike a frightened turtle.\u201dSmall if cold.Smile and wave boys.

If you've only ever read the title it's ambiguous. Most people have never read it but if you had it isn't ambiguous anymore. We fucked up, boys...I don\u2019t feel dumb because I had no concept of how deep a league was. Especially when I read a kids\u2019 version of that book at like age 8.Leagues aren't used to measure depth in the first place, thats fathoms. Spanish is like that. You can't translate \"to be or not to be\" without losing all ambiguity either.Google tells me Moana\u2019s trench is 2 leagues deep. Or 7 miles for those of us who don\u2019t speak Boatpeople.\n\nEdit:I\u2019m leaving it. This corresponds to 2.4x the circumference of the earth.KnowhutImean, Verne?It's a great book, if you haven't read it already, then I recommend that you do. Yeah right. Everyone knows it was made up for back to the future part 3.I've been there. Me and some chums wandered in while exploring Dubrovnik and were trying to work out what the hell was going on. They also had a room just filled with CD's on strings that kinda looked like fish scales. Crazy place. I love it.\n\nWhat the hell is he holding though?

However when you get out of Earth's magnitosphere that's where you get problems. Protecting the crew from the radiation and giving them enough gravity so that their skeleto-muscular systems don't atrophy by the time they get to Mars is a challenge. \n> believe it is probably more difficult to go to the bottom of the ocean than go into space.\n\nNot really. The tricky part is coming back alive.\n\nSee also Mallory, everestWe joke around about having a flooding buddy. Yeah, yeah, grandpa.

I don't think you would have found it enjoyable if you had to keep your helmet, gloves and belt on while ejoying your sandwich at lunch.

The article was actually a good read.What\u2019s a refuge?Not often I hear a hardhat referred to as a \"helmet\".\n\nWhere I worked it was absolutely required at all times underground to wear your hardhat, safety glasses and belt. Regardless if you were on break or in a refuge station. Also, it's not supposed to be \"enjoyable\" so I don't really know how that point makes sense.Now I know what they mean when they say they're \"Down in the dumps\".[Yeah ](https://i.imgur.com/Ibeo8MK.png)Maybe you can finally explain how to use the three seashells She caught sea shells in the screen shotIt was a clean murder Skipper.

As a rule of thumb, \u201cser\u201d means \u201cto be in a certain state(of existence)\u201d (for example to be a doctor) and \u201cestar\u201d means \u201cto be in a certain place\u201d (for example to be on the beach). \n\n\nIt gets less intuitive when it comes to abstract concepts like states of mind, \u201cto be crazy\u201d and \u201cto be a crazy person\u201d could be translated as \u201cestar loco\u201d(which usually denotes more of a temporary state of mind) or \u201cser un loco\u201d (which implies a more permanent state) respectively. Kind of like with the \u201ceverything\u2019s gendered\u201d bullshit, by that point you need to rely more in getting a feel for it rather than having a set of rules you can follow. Yes.[deleted]Yeah my dad always told me like this: \"You know the second best day of your life is when you buy a boat?\" Prompting the follow up question and statement \"What's the best day?\" \"When you sell it\". Love sayings like thatIt doesn't mean anything but it's provocative It means if he went down, he went to spaceYeah, it's pretty deep. https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PotableCooperativeInchworm-small.gifDoes anyone actually use pal unironically these days?Nice! God knooooooows.In a similar vein, I've heard so many people claim that NIN covered Johnny Cash's Hurt.I assume ex-girlfriend by nowThey clearly did. Haven't you heard how similar under pressure sounds to ice ice baby???It happens. Not even sunlight can reach where these couples had been. The power-bottom of the sea*Yes. And now, both corporeal punishment and rum rations are abolished. Guess what's left.I always wondered where The Pogues got that album name from. Thanks!TIL I need to join the navy[deleted]Can I get some context/details on these kisses? Was celery involved?\"Manlove Thursday\" My wife said that out loud to me as I was reading her comments out loud. She grew up around Tacoma.A girlfriend in every port and a boyfriend on every ship.fyi. atm is actually a legit unit of measure. \n\nAlso, 1 bar (another unit of pressure) is roughly equivalent to an atmosphere\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_(unit)it's an accurate joke. Man I need to watch futurama againNo no, if you attack one with enough cocks is the old fashion joke not clocks......I think it also went in to some detail about how to mate with a female as well, though they did mention that it was a bit trickier.In the event of an emergency underground, workers are to head towards the nearest \"refuge station\" to regroup, count heads and ensure that everyone is okay. The station is equipped with oxygen, fresh drinking water, usually a stretcher aswell as soft clay to seal the the refuge station from the mine so no smoke / potentially harmful gases can enter the station. \n\nBasically, a safe house underground. Risky click of the dayHe doesn't know how to use the shells!Two for your eyes, and one for your bum.EverythingInnocence, all of it I had left after I saw LemonParty for the first time ....i need a hug...Yeah not clicking that thank you very much\n\n\nEDIT: its a rick roll isnt it?What she order?

Or turn gay.. Nah man, one goes dun dun dun dun-dun  dun dun...\n\n\nAnd the other goes dun dun dun dun dun-dun dun.\n\n\nTotally not the sameYeah but I heard the record label was putting them under pressureI know in the Royal Navy, they abolished flogging in 1940, and the rum ration in 1970. Apparently most of the reason for abolishing the rum ration was cost. And IIRC there are still cases where a captain has discretion to give one.It's a brilliant name for a punk album.The US Navy submarine fleet is a predominantly male-only environment. A few boats have crews consisting of both men and women, but the rest are all men.Well for context, every time the big Navy ships leave, they have to come back to dock later because some chick got knocked up (then they get the benefits AND don't have to deploy for too long)\n\nSo I could understand submarines not wanting to have womenNo celery and most of the time it was just like we looked at each other and got close and kissed but 2 times stand out for me really,\n\nFirst time I met this guy he walked up to me, looked deeply into my eyes and kissed me right on the lips, I had been on the sub for like 3 days and this was the first time I talked to this guy. He said I'm gonna do well here since I didn't freak out (side note, he kissed me in front of my then fianc\u00e9 the first time they met and apparently we made out on my 21st birthday but I was too drunk to remember)\n\nSecond thing a guy who was a first class at the time, (soon to be chief select) came up to me while I was trying to get to the head., he stopped in front of me, grabbed my face and licked my mouth, like stuck his tongue out and ran it from one cheek to the other.\n\nBut again, most were just out of love for my brosNot as risky as them exploding turtlesI'm grateful that I still don't know what lemonparty or blue waffles are. :) here's one ***hug*** for youIf you edit within 3 minutes of making the comment it wont show an asterisk so it will look weird if you put an \"EDIT:\" in the comment.Fish filletI understood this reference.The exact same number as in an average Walmart parking lot at any given time.How the hell did I spell Auli'i correct but Johnson wrongI\u2019m totally baffled that I did the same thing. Same could be said for Hendrix' all along the watchtower.  It's definitely his song. Dylan said the same thing,  but it wouldn't have existed without Dylan.  \n\nEdit:  That being said,  as much as I love  Cash's version,  NIN definitely did it better.  There is a difference between a brainfart, saying dumb stuff, being a serial killer and fucking not knowing about QueenGay people say dumb shit too.Guess it\u2019s time to be gay now. Goodbye women.Thank you for perfectly depicting the dun dun\u2019s. I could hear the difference between the songs in my head!That makes way too much sense This makes me happy.\n\nMy bf is a second class and he and his RP friend get very intimate with each other. It can be weird sometimes. \n\nWhen I first met his friend, they walked in to the apartment, pregnant wife in towe, looks my bf dead in the eyes and shouts \"Bring that ass here Little Daddy, been missin' that thang\". Little Daddy. His wife just gave me a look that basically said 'get used to it, this is how they interact'. They've also threatened to blow each other. Not sure how that's a threat but they seem to mean it as one.How about Goatse?Yo whip so cooooldI understood *this* reference.I remember Dylan saying something along the lines of \u2018I wrote the song, but I didn\u2019t realize it\u2019s full meaning until Jimi sang it\u2019. Proves how awesome Dylan really is Thank you! I love NIN's version.\n\nMight be because I'm not a fan of Cash, but still.The last one is the only deal breaker. Even a serial killer can only kill **you** once. I think there is a big difference between being ignorant and actively claiming something to be true that is demonstrably wrong Actually thats not entirely true, I am a sailor, and we dont bring the ship back for one knocked up female. Depending on the strike group we would fly her to the carrier then cod (carrier onboard delivery = C2 Greyhound) her off to the nearest city to be flown back to the US. Just depends on how far away we are, but this is a very big problem. If you want out of deployment, just get pregnant, and thats how many girls see it. \n9 month deployment < 18 years.I understood *none* of the references. A self-referencing reference... referenceptionLeonard Cohen said giving Dylan the Nobel prize for literature was like giving Everest a medal for being the world\u2019s tallest mountain.In my opinion,  Dylan is the greatest song writer of our time... our time being anyone who has been around to experience his music.  Look at what he's written,  and what has been covered from other artists.  A lot of people love to hate his voice ( I quite like it personally) but still love his songs done by other people.  I guess that's why I say writer,  and not singer / songwriter... anyway,  I digress.  Not a fan of Cash? Heresy!Another one bites the dust",

Like my mind will always revert to 1920s due to history classes.Maybe for you.It's not completely unreasonable for someone alive today to make it to 2113. The average Reddit user is 18 - 29 years old. There's 94 years until the next \"teen\" year. Even at the higher end of that age range, by 2113, they will be 123. The oldest verified age was 122 (some people in countries with less reliable records claim to have lived longer). Given the advances in medical science, it's not out of the question that someone born in 1980 might make it to 123 years old. Taking the lower end of that range gives us 112 which is certainly not out of the question. I have multiple relatives that made it to 100+, and they lived through two world wars. With the medical advances and healthier lifestyles present today, there's a decent chance of me making it to 100+, and if I can make it that far, then there's plenty of people here that can make it to that age.Speak for yourself man.  I plan to live forever.LivesActually I was planning om becoming immortal or at least live for a very long time so 117 should be fineThat means that in a couple of months we\u2019ll finally be able to sleep with our datesSpeak for yourselfUnless we live to the next century.LifesIs that a challenge?!You don't know how long the younger generations will liveLots of people talking about 2113.

I just want a good long healthy life for me and the mrs and then I want off this rock that we're turning into an absolute shithole.Ever heard of the grey goo theory of mass extinction?  Just picture self replicating nano bots programmed to make our lives better but in following programming enslave the human race in a nano 'matrix' deal.  Ultimately humans will be unnecessary and devoured along with all earthly matter  to create more 'helpful' nano bots.  Thus replacing all of earth with what would appear from space as a planet of grey goo.I doubt they\u2019ll make them available to the general public.

I was looking for thisOh, I'm not stupid, Lucius. No one lives forever. No one. But with advances in modern science, and my high level of income, I mean, it's not crazy to think I can't live to be 245, maybe 300. Heck, I just read in the newspaper that they put a pig heart in some guy from Russia. Do you know what that means?Medical advancements are one thing but the way our climate and environment are evolving it can all be for naught.  \nI'm not particularly optimistic that the next 100 years will have the continued upward curve for our species as a whole.This claim is just pure science fiction. Only a handful of humans have ever reached those ages. There's nothing to suggest that we'll ever be able to extend human life to regularly reach them, and that's not even taking into account the ability to provide any sort of quality of life for people of that age that would make anyone even want to get there.I wonder how many 12 year olds I'm regularly arguing with online.Oh my god, youre like 11, why are you on reddit??Small? Try large chance buddyAs a fellow Gen X'er, I recognize, relate to, & approve of this can-do attitude!  HMB - we got this.Well if worst case scenario happens, we'll just go to Mars and destroy another planet.My childless gang refuse to have kids for this reason. Let's not create more humans to make them suffer the consequences of the bad decisions made people in power today.Possible? Hard to predict future mortality rates in the age range 100-110.I'm in my late 20's (32) so I definitely won't see it, but I really hope you get to. I hope that in 2113 you remember these comments and laugh. \n\nBut make the 94 years between then and now amazing.

Before that we had the 00's (which I heard pronounced as ''naughties'')I would probably say \"back in the teens\". And for the 2000-2009 decade since \"noughties\" sounds awful I usually just say \"back in the early 2000s\"Every TV show and movie of my youth always had a young person who\u2019d say something like, \u201cget with the times! It the 80s!\u201d (and later the 90s)\n\nI\u2019m curious to see if that sort of phrasing will come back in the 20s.Maybe just a little too soon. Wish we could\u2019ve squeezed some names out of the fucker first.Whether he was killed or induced to kill himself or killed himself of his own volition, a bunch of wealthy pedophile elites breathed a sigh of relief when he died.

The fact is that the maximum human lifespan \u2014 a concept often confused with \"life expectancy\" \u2014 has remained more or less the same for thousands of years.Life expectancy is an at-birth statistic. The expected age for you to live is what the life expectancy was when you were born.\n\n~~If in 2050 the life expectancy is 100, that doesn't mean *your* life expectancy is now 100. It means the life expectancy of babies born in 2050 is 100.~~Not quite true. Advances in sanitation, medicine, etc, have increased life expectancy, but the human life span has always been around 100 years. \n\nIt's going to take some insane breakthroughs in gene editing to actually increase the human life span.No one lives forever, no one. But with advances in modern science and my high level income, it's not crazy to think I can live to be 245, maybe 300.with obesity rising like it is, idk. Just like this generation might be the first one with a lower iq than the previous, i see it happening for life expectancy too. Maybe not worldwide because 3rd world countries will definitely up it by a lot, but in developed countries..and burry him under some leafsThis post will be archived by then, but maybe future Reddit will make an exception for the 94-year-old baby.A 94 year old baby. Didn't they make a movie about that?Post will be locked. \n\nSo, baby can flip off the screen in 2113?o/I\u2019ll be 120. See ya there.Same but I don't feel like I'll be alive by then tbh lmfao.

Then in middle School I got a MacBook and in high school I got a Droid x2 or something. \n\nEven in my brief experience, technology has explosions that make me hopeful about my life span.

The richest people will always have first access to the best medical technology in the world.I think there's a decent chance immortality or at least virtual immortality will exist by thenI'm happy to know I'll be dead by then. Not even considering my current age, 94 years is a fucking long ride. I don't even want to live this long and I'm like 64 years from it.\n\nLife is fun and all but hey... Gotta go for an endless sleep someday, once enough has been lived and seen. Otherwise this wouldn't be this fun actually.Imagine being some decrepit centenarian with dementia then suddenly remembering \"oh shit, I have a screenshot from Reddit 94 years ago I gotta show people.\"I for one am planning to be among the first people to have lived in three different millenia.Ann PerkinsHello, historians!I believe I am that person.We have someone with an age above 115 most of the time already (currently we have [two verified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people) at that age and three more will reach 115 in January/February 2020). Even if we just keep the life expectancy we'll get many more reaching 115 in the future based on the growing world population.\n\nWhen I made the top-level comment it was at tens of upvotes, so I used a young age because they have better chances to make it to 113, but now that the post blew up...

It has **not** caught on.I've always heard \"The Oughts\" (edit: or noughts) or however you'd spell it. Or just the 2000's. The latter seems to be the most common and most people seem to recognize it is the 2000 to 2009 years rather than the whole millennium or centuryI never understood why we never just collectively went for \"twenty-hundreds\" just like everyone's fine with \"nineteen-hundreds\" and \"sixteen-hundreds\".Oh you naughty boyPretty sure it\u2019s \u201cteens\u201dI've heard \"oughts\"It\u2019s pronounced ooze.Back in aught 6 maybe aught 7Wouldn't they just be 'the oughts' or 'the ohs'?Would have been nice if he died 50 years ago.Ooooops. My bad!It's degradation of cells that they're trying to reverse, not just trying to cure sickness and cancer. The idea is to maintain an age or de-age so it's a whole new ballpark.r/TIHIAlso, life expectancy statistics take into effect total average life expectancy of a general population. That includes infant mortality rates. People act like there weren't 80 year olds walking around in the 1700s. There were. Fewer, but they existed. There were just a lot more dying in childbirth for both babies and their mothers and that brought the life expectancy down.\n\nSure, more of us will make it to old age but there is only so long we can postpone death. People start to slowly decline mentally by their 60s. There's no stopping that from naturally happening.Don't know why are you being upvoted, this is just wrong\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy\n\n> Cohort LEB is the mean length of life of an actual birth cohort (all individuals born a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born many decades ago, so that all their members have died. _*Period LEB is the mean length of life of a hypothetical cohort*_ assumed to be exposed, from birth through death, to the mortality rates observed at a given year.[1]\n\n\nAnd\n> National LEB figures reported by statistical national agencies and international organizations are indeed estimates of period LEB.Don't you put that curse on me!Source on the IQ?

Best of luck!Honestly random chest pain is [way more normal than you\u2019d think](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precordial_catch_syndrome).\n\nYou might consider picking up a bit of exercise though; it\u2019s a lot easier to put in a little work to keep what you have now than to attempt to rebuild something when you\u2019re older, and you\u2019re starting to get closer to that threshold.Chest pain could mean a ton of diff things but if ur a hypochondriac like me I woulda been to the doctor 10x already. However I highly recommend some basic cardio as often as u can, even 15-20 mins makes a difference in how you feel, it\u2019s very worth itI will live longer than you.Wiseman: \"How do you know she's a witch?\"\n\nMan: \"She turned me into a newt!\"\n\nWiseman: \"A newt?!?!\"\n\nMan: \" Uh, I got better.\"I went to school once and did science, I know how the universe works, don't come at me with your \"rich and fancy enough to own books\" attitude.Yeah it's amazing how times have change and how technology has exponentially sped up, just waiting for flying cars and holograms and we will be in the future, except for the damage we do to this planet. \n\nLife spans are slowly increasing as medicines improve and we are starting to have a working understanding of how things now will affect us in 50 years time.

I'm down with the La-Li-Lu-Le-LoThat's what a mean. Shed this mortal coil.My life's great. Future ones, probably not so much.Immortality also frees up a ton of scientists who are currently working on ways to deal with various aspects of mortality. I think nanobot-immortality would not be the Malthusian catastrophe we envision. I mean, imagine all the people and resources currently employed in medicine shifting their focus to things like environmental issues or space exploration. Nearly all of the hospitals, doctors' offices, diagnostic labs, etc. would become unnecessary and be replaced with people developing and distributing nanobots.Heaven is just going to be your brain in a jar hooked up to a VR sim.Assuming we will be wealthy enough to afford it.That'd probably be a virtual clone - it wouldn't be *you*, but another you.San Junipero anyone?Yea no. I think 94 years is a damn short time. I'm 23 right now, so most likely I'm already over 25% done with life. And once your time is up its going to be up forever. And you know what, forever is a long fucking time. 94 years is too short.\n\nFor me knowing I won't be able to experience or at least know what our future holds is the worst. I would like to be able to leave this world on my own terms, but thats not going to happen. Sadly that is our reality.Think of that karma train!oh hi dadBecause reddit isnt a place for 12 year olds per reddits Age policy, which is 13 years old. You're technically an illegal alien here!>I'm more in the mindset that not having kids is the greenest decision you can make.\n\nThis isn't a mindset, it's pure undeniable fact.Seriously, dont let it worry you. When I turned late 20 I found a whole new level of not giving a fuck.trust god, fuck 1260% of the time it works every timeI thought the 00-09 were the Aughts?Well, no, wait, you're on to something. If 9 + 10 is nineteen, then 10+10 is tenteen.I\u2019m 39 and am hoping to see this in my lifetime.  I might be a little too old though already.  Even if I do see it in my lifetime I\u2019m likely to not be wealthy enough to afford it.\n\nI can dream though.  Eighty-ish years old does not seem like enough time to me.  I want more.  :)That still won't change the average lifespan of the population. People need to be able to afford the treatments as well. That will not happen in the next hundred years.Telomere degradation!  Turns out when we start messing with them, the result is usually some form of cancer.The point is it's a massive leap from treating existing diseases more effectively to essentially re-engineering human biology.

Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, I believe book 3 but it's been so long. The best part is that in physics this is basically true.

I could happy live as a brain in a jar for a bit.I believe that\u2019s the idea, but if it\u2019s forgotten about, it could be catastrophic. \n\nIt\u2019s similar in severity to Y2K, if people get everything changed over in time, then no problems whatsoever.\n\nBut if industries and government institutions don\u2019t change over before then, it could be a huge issue, I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say \u201cthe world will end\u201d but it\u2019ll certainly be time consuming, costly, and potentially dangerous if it doesn\u2019t get addressed.Your balls harden?

With my luck, a way to stop aging at whatever age you start the treatment will be invented around the time I turn 80 and don't give a fuck anymore.\n\nI'd love it if I can reach 2100, though. Just to say I saw the 22nd Century. :)I'm 23 and I'm not very hopeful. Maybe we solve most horrible ways of dying by the time I'm 50.100 yrs is a decent amount of time for optimization. 40 years ago most people couldn't afford a computer, decent cellphone, DSLR camera,or HIV treatment... Just 12 years ago a 2GB USB stick was $72 ($96 adjusted for inflation) and now they run less than $3 eachThere's so much to discover in this world though!

Feel the lusty power of being a mod in what may be Reddits final stand.\n\nEdit 2: evidently there was an errant mod who was removing others, if you were removed message me again\n\nEdit 3: Ill try to add all the people who requested mods, right now though its adding sometimes and sometimes not so Im taking a break\n\nEdit 4: So evidently we added the max amount of mods possible so Im super sorry to anyone who I didnt get to in time :/ dont let it stop you, just make up your own subreddit and feel that power. Then hit me up and I'll subscribe :)What on earth is going onYou're no.2 on my front page.\n\nWell done dude!The fuck is going on? I believe in you buddy. may your beacon of hope transcend the sky of /r/all.\nA fellow mod of /r/NEVERPRIVATE[deleted]Wait! What's going dark now?Post a picture of your own butt please [deleted]/r/NEVERPRIVATE is coming back, guys! I will now proceed to mod everyone that respond to me. Together, we can make reddit not do something. Or maybe. Or maybe not. That's yours to decide!Still trying to figure out why 75% of reddit is going darkThis is my chance to finally make a top comment. \n\nWtf do I write\n\nEdit : can someone tell me why she was fired. I want to know victorias secret...Me: \"Dad look, I made it ! To the front page!\" \n\nDad: \" No wonder the front page sucks today!\" \n\nMe: :'(.... still made it.I'm just really proud of you for getting to the front page. Is there any way to print this out to put on your parent's fridge? Because this deserves to go right next to that beautiful finger painting you did when you were 12. Where is Buzzfeed going to get all its content?!?!?!?  ITS CHAOSThis is now an AMA for you since you reach frontpageOMG, it worked! http://38.media.tumblr.com/6a9a24d72dcbde74b896012f74356a06/tumblr_mnt1gsCgeh1sqnzbgo1_400.gifAyyyyy you did itWhat are you gunna do if /r/showerthoughts goes private??[removed]Allow me to ride on your coat tails, Captain.im going veganhttp://i.imgur.com/TuyzEHO.png\n\nfollow your dreamsYou did good.. Now stay here until morningYou clever twat you.I have to give it to you, that was an awesome move.You did it famPENIS\n*top comment here I come!*Number 147 on front page. \n\nLet's get this to the top! Be sure to post/repost something stupid. My one and only front page post was a dumb gif for my cake day.[deleted]I'm proud to be apart of history right now.\n\nbucket list?i'm gayI'm proud of you.'grats. o7Does this mean Reddit is dead?You made it! Got my attention right off the front page. Spread the news everybody! Something something Reddit, woo, hey, front page, first gold, thanks everyone, edit omg, my first gold, omg top voted post ever for nonsense, bows, nervous, mom's spaghetti... meet for kisses... warlizard?Well, are you happy now?I always wonder how frequently an average redditor makes it to the front page.\n\nAnybody know?I woke up this morning and decided that I needed to join Reddit no particular reason why I picked today.. But man it's certainly a hell of a day to choose Herp derpDoes this also mean it's my best chance to get gold? I suppose it does. So uh.. dear kind strangers, my name is Sarah Mclaughlin, would you make a gold-less redditors dream come true? For the price of one gold, you could make one chubby white kid very happy for like 15 minutes.Reddit going dark over this is stupid.  It's the community's job to make quality content on Reddit, not the Reddit staff's job.  Their job is to monitor and sell ads.  If no one can figure out how to do shit without staff, then it's their own damn fault.God, people are idiots.\n\nI love how so many people assume that reddit is some kind of socialist utopia where everyone should have a vote, everyone should be fair, etc.\n\nJust one employee is fired and everybody goes crazy, like some righteous morons.[deleted][deleted]Sure, why not?And yet I still can't do it...Well done JeLoc.Here, have my help.Then this sub goes privateyou can do it!Excelsior!!Maybe I can make this comment before I fall asleepWas thinking that just as i heard about reddit going darkWhat are you going to do now that you've made to the front page of Reddit? You did it. \n\nYour cherry is popped. Should've jumped on it as well. But, Now the time is gone. \nI enjoyed upvoting this just to help you succeed in your attempt to take advantage of the blackout. Congratz! \ud83d\udc83[deleted]I got the #1 post once, way back in early 2008.\n\nBack in them days, you only needed two or three hundred upvotes.  We also only had one reddit back then.  None of these new-fangled subs that keep seeming to break down.  And none of this wearing an onion on your belt, don't know where you kids ever got that idea from.  Plus It was still acceptable to make fun of fatties in an open forum.\n\nOh those were the good old days.You just hit No.1 on my front page :)Drop Reddit. It's dead. Look elsewhere.A bit of a hollow victory...r/funny just went private.anyone who wants front page status go for it now.That's racist.fuck. I just thought of the idea. I think we need to stop giving gold. Take away money then see people start to panic. You did it buddy! :DThis is going to be one of my favorite Reddit posts of all time\nit workedPao AMA w/Victoria now!get a mug like the other guy did!\nYou can thank VictoriaThis was the first post on my front page Well, this is depressing.\n\nAt least this sub hasn't gone private.I'm so confused what is going on??Number 1 on my front page. Way to go, Smitty!Congratulations on doing the thing! You're at the top of my front page, get down wit yo bad self.This sub should shut down too. I love reddit. The Website. I hate reddit the company Join the strike you fucking scabs.What happened?\nhttp://i.4cdn.org/b/1435915427455.pngLucky for you that r/showerthoughts wasn't one of the things that went dark, hmm?Welcome to /r/EternityClub!I wonder how long until this sub goes private too..I read that as \"75% of reddit going dank memes...\"\n\nYou hit the frontpage. Not only that, but you've got the top post right now and you've got gold for this. How does it feel to be at the top?Can somebody please Tl;DR what is happening with Reddit going dark? Why is this happening?Can I be top comment then?[deleted]I am just thankful that all of the subreddits I use to waste time are work are still (mostly) still up and running. Don't know what I would do without /r/Gifs, /r/TIFU and /r/Creepy [deleted]Can we start a campaign where nobody buys gold since gold supports reddit? It can be a way for the users to show support for all the modsSo what is the next best link site now when Redit threw in the towel. I am prepared to swisch.Can someone fill in those of us who don't know why 75% of reddit is going dark?[deleted]So theoretically the dark side is the bright side because you got on the front page, which means the bright side is when everything is going bad. (Do you understand me?) Therefor Reddit is the illuminatiAnd you got gold for it. 2 birds 1 stone. \n\nNow go tell your wife how much you love her.What does this mean? I woke up to this but haven't found an explanation. So you're saying if I post here and say 'Gold' I'll get huge points AND gold? \n\nWoahThank god gonewild has not gone dark. There's still a lit candle acting as a beacon of hope in this our most trying time. Okay, I would love to have a top comment, but what exactly does it mean when you say \"75% of Reddit is going dark?\"[deleted]You sir, are a genius.#1 on my front page, congrats.Does this mean this is my best chance of ever getting top comment?Congratulations, just subscribed to /r/neverprivate and I'll spread the word.\n\nConglaturationsI'm surprised this subreddit hasn't joined the protest..That's right. Keep dark fuckers.The biggest called shot in Reddit history.How can reddit go dark if the light is inside us?What the hell did gold do, and especially if you have more than one piece? I'm sure reddit will be fine (RIGHT? RIGHT?!) but just in case what was golds pieces whole purpose?The world is in chaos. Are we supposed to go back to online gaming or Youtube and get into arguments with 13 year olds about who did whose mom again?...oh wait.....that happened here tooGgwp friend. Your dream came true. Why do people buy Reddit gold to give to Reddit protest posts.Seeing as reddit had gone dark. Can i get a top comment?I swear half of the subreddits are moderated by children. If someone gets fired, it's because they did something wrong that could cause large problems to the company they work for in the long term if they are kept as an employee. But the childish moderators don't care and throw a temper tantrum shutting down their subreddits in a desperate attempt to try and get attention.I suggest we start using Reddit Silver instead of Gold https://imgur.com/gallery/sy9lVl4You're a fucking geniusIn the meantime, the front page is filled with subs I've never even seen before. Just waiting on a smaller sub to take this opportunity to commandeer the site.Redd-out on July 10th\n\n/r/JustsayNope/From the comments, I think 25% of reddit has no idea what the fuck is going onYou Maniacs! You blew this post up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell![A message to the admins by /r/4chan](https://i.imgur.com/8DmswLW.png)I am not going to get more than 3 upvotes on this one!Not if I and several others downvote you for no reason. \n\nThat would be just terrible.75% of reddit going dark means this is probably my best chance of ever getting a top comment\n\n;)I just upvoted everyone in this thread......seemed like the right thing to do. Perhaps we could all get into this, just for today, and just upvote the shit out of one another. Like a giant reddit grouphug!\nI can be apart of history now.[deleted]-_-\n\nWelcome to the age of internet over-sensitivity. It was supposed to have the opposite effect on us. This is a bit overblown.https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/[deleted]But if Reddit is going under its like being the last kid to buy pogs.And yet, only a fraction of the karma you'd expect.have an upvote for tryingWhen will there be light? Or is this the dark ages?You did it!!It worked.If you are out there... if anyone is out there... I can provide food, I can provide shelter, I can provide security. If there's anybody out there... anybody... please. You are not alone. Et voil\u00e0! Once you go black you can never go backYour doing it Peter!Pretty sweet dude.  When asked what he was doing next, he responded \"I'm going to DISNEYLAND!\"[deleted]This might be a good thing in a way. I read an article in the Washington Post about how even though the mercury preservative that has been blamed for autism in vaccines has been removed, the rates of autism are still going up. Then I learned that some flu vaccines are still carrying the thimerserol, or whatever it's called, and I simply wanted to know why is that still being used. What makes it such a \"hard to abandon\" preservative\"? does it hold up to heat in tropical climates better than others? WTF?!! All I was asking is, if there is any bit of controversy over this preservative, real or imagined, why aren't pharmaceutical companies dropping it like a hot rock and moving to some suitable substitute? First time I ever got my question rejected on Reddit. I was shocked. Been here for 3 years. Now I know what was going on. /u/JeLoc, you deserve a commemorative frontpage mug!I want Karma. Gold would be nice too.I am actually seeing subs on the frontpage I normally don't see. Not sure if it's a bad thing? Dang, I go to make [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/0xs0AJt) and by the time I'm done you guys have already sent him to the front page.Does this mean we can post any random crap on a big enough subreddit and it should get through? :oYou made it!congrats!Aaand you're getting no link karma.

I don't get this reddit going dark thing...ruck fedditSomeone just achieved something in life.......kudos to you buddy.You won dude!!!!Lol............nicely done champ!!!You bastard!Office productivity will increase greatly today.....!\nWHOOOOOOOOOOO, reddit black out !!!!!I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Perhaps I'm completely oblivious, but I haven't noticed much except Iama going private.hurt ourselves to hurt them...YEAH :(Excuse my ignorance... why the darkness?

Where are we going from here?\n\nIt's obvious that open forums like reddit need to/will exist. But what is the next step.This is the end of Reddit as a news platform. Though it may have a second chance as a livejournal-style platform.Why am I only now learning that there was an AMA with a man with two penises?I will miss AskReddit so much :( You were right.Congratulations for being correct.Why is reddit going dark?You can thank me later for being one of the 5276.So, can someone fill me in on what's happening? Did some punks mess this up?\nYou did itThe funny part is I'm worried all the cool redditors have moved on to a newer cooler website and then tells the uncool kids that everyone is going to 4ChanOr for me to get any work done this week..Reddit's gone dark?Posts like this making it to the front page means this is probably my best chance of ever hopping on a gold train.I am so fucking bored right now...This is the most meta reddit has ever gone.

This move, along with other recent events is indicative of reddits over all change of direction. Theres a massive gap between those who use the site, and those who use the site to make money.

Do you concur?Smaller subreddits tend to have a higher rate of people upvoting, at least in my experience.

They both wiggle when you eat them.I'm not competent enough at reddit to add in my Oscar speechThis isn't just about her being fired. The mods of major subreddits have been pissed **for a few years** with how Reddit handles communication between the mods and admins, and Victoria was the only person they could rely on to coordinate AMA's on these bigger subreddits, particularly IAmA. Her being laid off was just the final straw that triggered this uproar. The mods weren't notified and there was no contingency plan to take her role, meaning a lot of mods were left with no way to coordinate AMAs scheduled for today (because of said communication issues).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204dDoes anyone know the justification for firing her?  If not, then all of this protesting might be directed at what was a legitimate management decision.[deleted]http://i.lvme.me/ismww9t.jpgAn alcohol fueled one? It would be an honour!hahaha im only 4 years old (in reddit years). Bye old timer!yay! party time!But how she's going to verify it is really her, without Victoria?\n\n^(the correct answer - by firing somebody again)[like this](https://viccareers.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/scrooge-mcduck-swimming-in-money.jpg?w=770)some grill got fired and reddit is blowing upSomeone got fired/quit/whatever and now all of reddit is pooping their pants and having some kind of protest just amongst mods?

Not only was she an integral part of the trust users and mods have with reddit (she vetted a lot of the AMA's to ensure the person was actually answering the questions not their agent, things like this). Additionally it's suggested that she may have been let go for refusing to change the AMA model, it appears they wanted to have her do video AMAs and things like that. Most importantly the unsactimonious way in which she was let go shows that the owners of reddit don't really \"get\" reddit and what this community is, there was no communication with this community, that's just not cool. Additionally to /u/from_dust's explanation, she was let go with NO warning to the IAMA mods - who were literally in the middle of an AMA when they lost Victoria and had to go private so they weren't publicly running around like chickens without heads.I believe double dick dude is *technically* more popularYou dirty sonofabitch[SUCCESS!](http://imgur.com/TFYas8T)[fine](http://img05.deviantart.net/e9db/i/2012/246/9/d/cigarette_butt_by_siriux-d5dhy8j.jpg)too much soy sauce?with pleasure mon frereIn my honest opinion*Risky link for the day[I thought he meant more along the lines of this.](https://youtu.be/RAbfPDZdEBU?t=45)hey it's me ur stock broker True stock broth-ers\n[/r/OneTrueGod > One True King](http://imgur.com/a/tum01)Spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers \n\nEdit: Besides, Jon Targ is one true king.

Dust is made up of a small but meaningful percentage of human skin and hair cells (and in the right city and right library some other unspeakable human waste).

Mmm skin dust is the best spice.Used to watch the dust float around in the sun shining through windows as a kid, always wondered who they used to be. Then I realized were all made mostly of water, but its all the same water or particles just recycled. So all our brains are made up of the same stuff that used to make up other peoples brains. Just with I guess some other stuff and different nitrogen sparking amino acids. Weirded me out.And sometimes, just sometimes, it's a forensic catalogue of their smells.Hey, who turned out the lights? So when book lovers inhale the \"book smell\" they also ingest past human pieces? \n\nThanks for that.Now that\u2019s a good shower thought!No one is going to point out that dead skin cells would be broken down pretty quickly? I'm sure you wouldn't find any skin cells that were more than a year old.The thing about dust being made mostly out of dead skin cells is just a myth. It's mostly just dirt from outside. Dust is not mostly made up of human cells. Rather, it is a mixture of plain old dirt and fibers from our clothing. Ever wonder what happens when your clothes get worn out and threadbare? Well, that's where dust comes from. This is also why it gathers so easily into dust bunnies, which are just tangles of the fibers.[It's the Vashta Nerada!](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Vashta_Nerada)People will eat ass but skin flakes gross you out? Grow up[deleted]This is a myth.\n>It\u2019s not mostly human skin: that mainly ends up in the bath or shower. Two thirds of the dust in your house comes from outside, as dirt tracked in on your feet, and airborne particles like pollen and soot. The rest is mostly carpet fluff, clothes fibres and pet hair.\n\nStop spreading this nonsense. The large majority of skin that people lose is disposed of in the shower. And there is so much other stuff in the air, that even all human skin you lose would only be a tiny part of it.Hey! Who turned out the lights?That is what the ghosts are made of! Shame we can't hear their storiesSometimes a specific percentage ofdust\u00a0is said to be\u00a0skin, usually about 70 or 80 percent, but unless you're a molting bird or reptile (or you work in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory), very little of your environment is composed ofdead\u00a0body parts.\nlivescience.orgWell.. this exists..Is that the secret seasoning that makes an old book smell so good?Disgusting yet poetic All the dust came from stars.. hung out quietly in the library.. and will eventually die inside a black hole during the heat death of the universe..\n\nThe important part is that it was quiet in the library.  *Hey, who turned out the lights?*Some people spend hours and hours in the library aka inhaling humansVacuuming that place and desposing of the dust would be like throwing away a dead body - another shower thought since I don\u2019t have enough karma to post lmaoDust is not made of human cells. But a library already is that.The song Dust In The Wind by Kansas shows us why this post is so damn accurate. I work at a academic library and some of our books go years without being touched. Sometimes when you move them a whole lot of dust just rains down on you and you realize then that it has no where else to go but back on the books. And if you\u2019re the Harvard library, you may have some books actually bound in human skin.You are so much more than just a collection of cells.Its also a tree morgue right?This is quality thinking, i want whatever OP's on.Especially if you bind the books with human leather Thanks, I hate thisI\u2019ve always wondered how old the oldest skin flake from the oldest person was.  Like, is it possible if I find a dusty shelf in a building from the 1800\u2019s, I could find a bunch of DNA or parts from our grandparents or their grandparents.It\u2019s mostly dead human skin cellsThis is both disgusting and beautiful...but probably more disgusting.Hello and down votes to everyone who read the title \"dust is **partly** made of human cells\" but then decided to share articles on how dust is not *mostly* human cells.You say \"dust\", I say \"floor sugar\"I like books.Dis blew me noggin Idk why but I love this shower thought so much. Remember me when you're famous man :))This is gross and nice at the same time.An adult human sheds about 8 pounds of skin per year. I wish I had not looked that up...So every time I inhale through my mouth I'm committing cannibalism?So is the reason an old house is often called haunted because of all of the dust is made of people?[Relevant SCP](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4001)I\u2019m sure there is a time-layering effect where if you cut the dust cake there would be layers. \nHmmm, I love that old book smell(\u25d4_\u25d4)This is where I would post that image of Crab Man from My Name Is Earl - looking digusted.\n\nEdit: [There we go.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1kBlZYCcAE0Kx6.jpg)This sounds deeper than it is.Too bad some of em got HEPA Filters r/tihi Every time you take a breath,you inhale tiny part of everything that ever lived on earth.Star dustI'm currently in library.

He eats scabs off his neck among other things. ok we're taking away your internet access now Reminds me of Doctor Who.

We are made of stardust :)Damn.unsubscribeIs dust also partly made of farts ?Imagine a toilet in the airport.This is why you use a bagged vacuum.\n\nYeah yeah Dyson and Co are great. But you have to empty it, and you release the concentrated puff of skin cells and mites straight into the air.Ewwww grossWe all have Atoms from mars and extraterrestrial objects... and probably every person...  have a [watch](https://youtu.be/KUddy8RGwns) :), if you don\u2019t care about the whole video, the part explaining this will start at 5:35We always joked that half the dust you breathed in a day was a dead jewOk, that's actually kinda disgusting Thanks I hate it.You could say that about anything, I\u2019d argue skin doesn\u2019t constitute a person just a little of their skinOh shit ew Ooh! That\u2019s interesting!Dust is mostly bug poop, cloth fibers, dirt, and dead mites. The amount of human skin cells in it is miniscule at most in most environments.Thoughts that make you want to shower.This is why the first scene in Ghostbusters is what it is.Yeah but they cleanThis is quality thinking, i want whatever OP's on.Wait a second... I'm not quite sure how long DNA survives in those skin cells omce they are shed. But does that mean that potentially, besides books and everything else, libraries of all ages also accidently stored gigabytes of data inside human cells aka DNA strands!? If so... that is kind of funky.now apply this theory to a brothel, then an emergency departmentSo mostly homeless people\nIts free cloning material if you ask meEvery place is...\n\n\nThe dust under a bed is mostly dead skin. So a hotel bed isnt just dirty cause they dont wash the cover. Its also a collection of every humans skin who slept in it before.\n\nAlso semen. Because even beds at newer hotels have been fucked in 100s of times.\n\nA hotel bed 10 years old has probably seen thousands of sexual encounters.I heard that they were poo particles mostly. Is that human cell though? A worse way to think of this, we breath in dust a lotThat is why I don't go to the libraryO noThis sub is on fire holy shitWell time to think about this in the shower.Lol, a DNA Library if you will \ud83d\ude02Libraries typically wipe through the books on a somewhat regular basis when moving books down the shelves to make space.

Traces of the famous people that lived there are still around, even though we can't see it. \n\nThough there is that lady who toured Graceland, found a toenail clipping in the shag carpet, and built her own museum around her Elvis toenail.Woaaaaaaaah what an awesome and interesting idea!! I've never thought of life in those termsThese are the kind of shower thoughts I come here for.I don't buy it. Ever been to a place nobody has been in a long time? An abandoned building or something?  Very very dusty. This human skin nonsense doesn't add up. Sorry.*Desire to squeeze an acacado intensifies*There's one under construction not far from me, it has no books yet so right now it just has people who have walked through it.I wonder how many of those books were on the bathroom...This is is fascinating and true. It reminds me of going to a museum in Montana a few weeks ago. They had a ton of antiques from the early 20th century -- actual belongings of people who have long since passed -- photo frames, toys, books, household appliances, personal things like hair brushes and what not. All of these antique items corralled together in this one place, and it got me to thinking -- anyone who at one point owned these things has probably long since died. And basically, there's probably the remnants of those people that are still with those items -- DNA, skin particles, etc. So they're all gone but literally a part of them still exists in this museum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKinda morbid, mostly sad. So that\u2019s why the avengers turned to dustr/TIHIThen we're all cannibals because we breatheI see someone has finished Sherlock season 3 recently. I\u2019m an electrician, I crawl around in crawlspaces that are typically about 70 years old in this area. The dust that settles down there is very fine, as it has sifted through the tiny cracks in the wood flooring. \n\nThat dust is VERY high percentage human skin cells, collected over decades. \n\nHow do I know?  \n\nThe taste!  Bluuuuug! Gross!EwwIn fact there was a pretty informative magazine article about new ways of testing old books for chemicals and substances to learn more about them - they study \"proteomics\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Proteomics is the study of the interaction of proteins in living things. Where genomics studies humans\u2019 roughly twenty thousand genes, proteomics is concerned with the shifting array of proteins assembled by those genes\u2014our biological content, more or less, from albumin, which makes up sixty per cent of our blood proteins, to beta-amyloid, a family of brain molecules that can be a potential sign of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Proteomics aims for completeness. The proteome of a single human cell, which might contain billions of proteins, is sometimes compared to an atlas. It can guide geneticists or drug companies to early markers of a disease, or to the precise mechanism of aging, or to promising targets for cancer treatment. The field has been made possible by spectacular advances in data analysis and in lab instruments, which become cheaper and more powerful each year. Top-of-the-line mass spectrometers now allow chemists to sort through thousands of types of proteins in a sample, and to study them, one molecule at a time.  \n\n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/do-proteins-hold-the-key-to-the-past](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/26/do-proteins-hold-the-key-to-the-past)Actually, most dust is mineral, powdered rock from the soil outside.Yeap, I worked at a University library. A lot of people get sick without a lot of people passing through, I always blamed the amount of dust that accumulates on very untouched books that merely serve as magnets to said dust. And after awhile you just get that stench of handling multiple books in all manner of different states, some relatively fine, some that you wouldn't even call a book anymore but x amount of classes demand it so people still rent it out despite it probably missing a chapter or two, and a coffee stain taking three more with it. And sometimes shifting/shelving books just gets a waft of dust going into your face, the cartoonish means of blowing dust off of old books isn't all that far from the real thang. \n\nIf it paid me more than 7.50 an hour I would've gladly continued to handle other people's skin cell covered books. I think you're overestimating the amount of human particles in dust. It would depend on the environment. In a library, I would assume most of the dust is from paper. You'd be surprised.Flashbacks to the Dr. Who episode with the Vashta Narada. The library started saving people.\n\n(Isn't that the first episode where River Song appears; last episode in her time stream)Er what does this have to do with libraries? You could just as easily say \"a grocery store isn't just a collection of food, but a collection of the people that walk through it\".\n\nI guess using a library somehow makes it more romantic or intellectual sounding or something.Finally an educated shower thought. And I think you're absolutely right. Which is a bit macabre but also kinda coolThis is morbid and horrifying. And yet...oddly comforting. Lots of homeless in my public libraries.  They need to install showers.Unless if they use Swiffer^\u00ae dusters, which effectively remove dust and have specialty coated fibers that grab onto the dust and don't let go. I've always had a question about this. In a place that humans haven't entered in let's say 10 years, where does the accumulated dust come from? By that logic, every book there shares the same collection from the people who read them.I\u2019m thinking about all the dust I cleaned off a shelf in the grocery store where I work\n\nI\u2019m disgusted GrossEvery year around Christmas I clean the skin flakes and eyelashes from my keyboard, then build a mini Smapdy0. My co-workers are generally not impressed. Think about that next time you blow on a dusty old book! Technically, you\u2019d be blowing hundreds of people at once.Don\u2019t... know... whether... to be... disgusted... or if this is kinda ... cool? \ud83d\ude2cSo basically all Cell needed to do in DBZ was go to a library and he would\u2019ve been able to generate Gohans powers?This is about as deep as saying every time somebody farts, you are smelling their colon. It's not cool, it's just reality.Borrowed a book from a local library.  It had bloody boogers all thru it. I don't borrow books anymore.\nThis is somehow incredibly sweet and yet disgusting at the same time.Holy fuckWell if libraries were never cleaned. And dust never left the surface it first settled on due to air flow, contact with other people and objects, and static electricity. And if dust never broke down into other matter and became reconstituted into other living beings. Then, sure, libraries are collections of the people who walk through it.\n\nBut in reality all of those things happen. Dust is frequently removed by people or naturally circulated from inside to outside, and outside to inside. The dust in the library will not be exclusively from people who have walked through it. And it will not be anywhere near a comprehensive collection of samples from people who have actually walked through it.\n\nFor example, every single day the librarian eats her lunch at work she is most likely consuming tiny specks of that dust which have landed on her food, her hands, or her cutlery. Those dead skin cells then get broken down in her gut and become part of her. Those tiny traces of the people who shed those dead skin cells are gone forever.Damn it thanosIt's symbolic in a way. Until you realize the massive germ hazard.I love asking vegans what they think they're ingesting into their bodies when they breathe in dust. Fuck youIoun wants to know your locationI remember one time I got on a coach bus and bumped the seat in front of me. There was a cloud of dust that rose from it.Never thought of it this way \ud83e\udd14Awww. Somehow this makes me all warm and fuzzy That's deep manIts a collection of books and people before the internetIts a collection of books and people before the internetDust is, in homes at least, is mostly skin actually.For some reason, I love this one. Don't know whyAaaaand I'll never go into a library again..Does that make a pedegg the human cheese grater for cannibals then?I am disturbed, but informed lmao thanks for that \ud83d\udc80Absolutely disgusting...I love it!Ew.thanks I hate itSo you are telling me that i can rub my dick on the bible even after i die. Thanks mate!it takes what? a decade for your one exhaled breath to distribute itself through the atmosphereEw TIL i'm literally allergic to people :'(Aaaaaand that's why I only read ebooks. I picked up a dusty book in an abandoned forest, fuck youEvery time you smell books, you smell parts of people that has ever read those booksThis could be applied to anything. Museums are a collection of the people who walk through it; supermarkets are a collection... etc..ugg that is really a creepy though. You think all that dust can come together and form a dust human?Which means dusting in a library is the equivalent of burning it down.Unless there wasn't any cleaning maintenance on that library... Thanks I hate it. Like 10% of me appreciates the beauty of this statement and the overwhelming majority is so grossed outIn fact this is being used to analyse the libraries of famous writers to discover their diets and any drugs they took for their medical ailments like opium and mercury compounds. .

Orgies for everybody Thanks I hate itYou\u2019re fun at parties I bet.i mean this doesn't really have much to do with libraries, more just about any public placeThinking about this in other contexts, my mind immediately went to my memory of visiting Dachau as a young lad and wow. I thought that memory could not have gotten more disturbingHoly shit what the fuckYeeaghThis... I don't like this.Whoa, that's deep.YuckThat's kind of romanticMaybe in the distant future we can clone people based on old ass skin dust.

I wanted to downvote, then recognized how cool it was, also gross though.Dust is Partly made of human cells. Wow. TILWhat about an old library that hasnt had anyone in it for a couple years? What percentage of the dust is skin cells? that also means we breath people around us...yikesBrings personal vacuum to work, colleagues question why, but they don\u2019t want to know. They really don\u2019t. Can't wait to rub myself on your literary treasures. Don't worry, all that dust is host to mites, parasites and bacteria that eat the dead skin you inhale all day.Just don't look under the computer desks in the adult room!Umm.....people \u201cdust\u201d is everywhere. Not just libraries.....lol.i work on hottubs.\n\n At least you dont gotta guess between old ppl skin flakes or calcium buildup.\n\nIn my life.. your burden is my blessing. \nI work in a library and we have cleaners whose only job is to remove things the humans left behind. Wait, so do nerds smell like libraries, or do libraries smell like nerds?I've been to public libraries and I'm disgusted.Well I am a public library and I feel offended!I used to work in a library (academic)... the dust, my god, the dust. Shifting ranges should have required a respirator.I wouldn't worry much. Skin dust is everywhere. You can't escape it.But he ends up telling him he saw it on reddit \ud83d\ude02Statistically they'll be mostly your cells and from people that work in there as well. \n\nSo yeah, you're breathing pieces of the intern.I remember something about some library copies of 50 Shades getting tested, for some reason, and were found to contain about 6 different STD's and various drugs like cocain and meth. I\u2019ve learned that bedbugs also love living in between the pages of books. How much dust does it take to recreate a full humanI\u2019ve actually always wonder how it\u2019s like to be in a submarine Like 20 years consecutively?The \u201cX% of dust is human skin!\u201d is a myth. I suppose there\u2019s crazy amounts of dust gathered in our clothes and food and machinery and such.\n\nWeird how no one has pointed this out. Dust is by no means mostly human skin. That\u2019s so weird to think about. In a closed area it\u2019s just you. It\u2019s just youEven just living in an apartment with concrete floors, you get tumbleweeds of body hair within a week.

Large percent of dust is dead skin that falls off of humans can i eat itHey! Who turned out the lights?You\u2019re right. I usually peel off my skin and dispose of it cleanly in the trash...\n\nBut, back to reality, your skin sheds off. We know that. In an abandoned area left untouched, sure, it can be dirt and other settled particles from the air. However, in places commonly trafficked by humans, the dust definitely contains human skin. It doesn\u2019t disintegrate after falling off or float right to heaven. The same place all dust comes from: dirt and pollution in the air.\n\nVery little dust is actually human skin.ew*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** dion_o! ^(hug)ewThe vacuum is is so they can start their own personal collection of people, right?r/gattaca_irlSince some of the people are probably dead just clame to be catching ghosts I said don\u2019t disturb me while I\u2019m cleaning my room!See Cheryl?!

I know that iron (and thus anything past it) is hard to make in stars because it takes energy. I was confused how we have elements past it, cant believe I didn't think of supernovas.

Do you enjoy apparently smart people doing obviously dumb things? Are you nostalgic for mid-00s / early 10s?\n\nThen by golly Doctor Who is the show for you. Basic plot of the show us there's a space wizard flying through spacetime doing stuff, making things, getting cray with all sorts of life forms. Theres more to it but there's not enough wibbly wobbly bits to get into it here.\n\nThe episode getting referenced is a two parter, so it's not the best place to start. Neither is the beginning. And neither is the other beginning. Look it's complicated. ANYWAY\n\nI recommend you, and anyone else new to the Doctor Who universe, to start with \"Blink\" Series * 3 Episode 10. It's a fantastic episode, memeable, quotable, and will give you a sense of why it's one of Reddit's favorite shows. Give it a shot if you love big universes, fantastical characters, mystical technobabble, and cheeky dialog.\n\n\n*see the show is British they call it Series not Season. It's their show they get to be wrong about that small detailYes is that one, also the first episode (or the last, depends on points of view...) where River Song appears. Episode 4x08/4x09   \"[Silence in the Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silence_in_the_Library)\"/\"[Forest of the Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_the_Dead)\"No it's a Hooters jokeNot really, you need a well refrigerated fresh sample that has not been exposed to the elements.But there is no vacuum until you turn the machine on. The whole point is to make the vacuum dirty, which will make the machine dirty, in order to make the area outside clean. It doesn't actually clean it just transfers the dirt. How to delete an entire thread?What if it was a *reeeeaaallllly* small human?I don't have a perception of right or wrong and I completely agree with you.Put me in the screenshot and don't edit it at all, but touch yourself as you post it.Not really In this universe (with its specific set of constants), if you put enough hydrogen in one place and wait a few billion years it will start to think about itself.There's all kinds of routes to elements, supernovae are a big one!  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis)Hard to make, but not impossible. There are trace amounts of heavier atoms in stars and trace amounts of atoms in something as massive as a star is still a bunch, just floating around. When supernovas happen, my understanding is that the particles are sent out with equal force, but their mass makes it so they're sent out to roughly the same radius so when they start to congregate slowly due to gravity, they're able to find similar density particles.Hey, who turned out the lights?Lieutenant Dan you aint got no legs[deleted]Blink is a terrible episode to start at, it's quite different from the rest of the show. I'd suggest series 5 episode 1, \"The Eleventh Hour\" as a starting point.> Neither is the beginning. And neither is the other beginning.\n\nLaughed out loud.  It is indeed complicated.  Spoilers!I seen that episode after watching Rivers last episode with the old doc. It was a day or two later. I haven't seen enough River ones so she still confuses me, she's a future human that's a time traveler right? She meets up with the doctors, married Matt Smith doctor and had what's her face with him? But they meet at weird times so they have journals they compare to see where in each others lives they are currently at?No it\u2019s a whoville joke\"vacuum suction powered dirt and debris transfer machine\"Yesat least threeWhut?Ha! Prove it!!!Nucleosynthesis is the term I've been trying to come up with for so long!\n\nI took a short elective on the subject when I was in college and found it super interesting.Who turned out light?I don't see anything negative about the show in any of his post. He nailed the description of the show. And his description of the show is exactly what makes it so great. I started on blink. Scared the shut out of me. Then I binge watched from season 1. Yes! So many people recommend starting with Blink and while it's a great episode I have always thought it would be the absolute worst place to start, does nothing to give you a feel of what the show is like since it's so completely different.The first and only episode I\u2019ve seen is Adipose.Spoilers ;)That is slightly more accurate than the originally accepted \"vacuum cleaner.\" As long as we can teach those vacuum heathens a lesson. When that's done, we move on to microwaves next. #Put me in the screenshot and don't edit it at all, but touch yourself as you post it.Honestly \"space wizard\" is how I'm going to describe the doctor nowShould probably start series 1 episode 1 \"Rose\" Why did humans in dust turn to where to jump into the doctor who seriesSorry I didnt mean that to spoil anything its stuff I wasn't sure about her. Just what I've tried to piece together. I never see her it seems.oh ok",

    "Comments": "\"who was in charge of this absolute mess of dental health?! how do I even start fixing this\"36 and about to really start this process after years of depression and self sabotage. I can go back to when I was 8 when I started learning the bad habits and poor mindset that has gotten me to where I am. It's fucking painful, but hoping it will be worth it.Untucking your life in your 30\u2019s is much much better than in your 60\u2019s. ( just my (M 70) opinion)I still look for adults to help me do things and then I panic when I realize I AM an adult\u2026. #sendhelpThe teenage years are the buffering stage in the video of life.And what\u2019s failing at even that called \u2026 asking for a friendThats not a shower thought. \n\nThat's a lay in bed thinking about ones failed relationships, lack of 401k, no insurance, rent is going up next month, MY JOB SUX kinda thought  :)I unfucked my life at 24, 45, and 55. Good luck keeping your life unfucked.[deleted]Well look on the bright side. 30 is young as hell so you can still steer the ship back on course.In my 40s, it's like building a deck with a Swiss Army knife.I love this haha! My mental health has never been great, anxiety and depression my whole life. But the year I hit 30, I was raped and things got worse. I started therapy and really dove into working through things, and for the first time in my life, I have coping skills. 2 years later, I got my GED after studying my ass off. Then months after that I enrolled in a school to learn medical coding. I still struggle, but listen. 30s isn't old yet, we can still do the things! We still got this. It's never too late. LET'S DEBUG THIS SHITTTTT!Yup. I was too worried about having fun and friends when I was younger and now that I\u2019ve raw dogged my life and fucked it beyond belief\u2026I\u2019m trying to make up for lost time and in the process have chosen to cut out all but two people in my life, no love, absolutely no social circle, and just really secluding myself on purpose.[deleted]I feel like 30's is actually a good time to get unfucked. That's when I started. Still struggling with some addiction issues and finances.. but I'm glad I started fixing myself.It's a lot harder because there's no version control.also not easy when everyone in your family still treats you like a kid or doesn\u2019t take you seriously bc of shitty life choicesThis is like the worst age, you are mature enough to recognize all the stupid shit you did it didn't do so far and start to feel old with little to no time to fix it.I would like to know who is in their 30s and doesn\u2019t have any random body pains or any mental issues. Who are you and what did you do in your 20s?As a 26 year old who\u2019s just now (passed 2 months) realizing all the importance\u2019s of good credit, insurances, savings, and investing for retirement \n\nI am grateful I am doing it now but I\u2019m also really annoyed at younger me for being so fucking stupid when he has PLENTY of opportunities to not put me in the situation I\u2019m in lolI\u2019m unfucking my life in my 30s and can confirm this statement. I\u2019m also learning Swift programming.Recently turned 38 here. In a rush to unfuck it before 40. There\u2019s still hope!So far my 30s has been unpacking, assessing and tossing aside all of the generational trauma that was handed down to me while doing my best to raise my 2 boys.\n\nI also found out that I have ADHD and Anxiety during this so far extremely fun process...Began unfucking my life at 36. Started out a 360lb whiskey swilling* chain smoking wow addicted fatass living in my father's basement.   Now 46.  Quit smoking, lost 168lbs, hit the gym. Moved in with roommates then my own small apartment. Got an actual wardrobe of clothes.   Learned country line dancing. Met my wife there almost 7 years ago to the day. September will make 5 years married.  Have a good stable job,  3br house with a backyard and a dog.\n\n*Typo editThere is plenty of time to set things on course.  Just play to your strengths.  Life is long.I\u2019m dealing with a couple lines where I can see only one clearly labeled variable named \u201cCaffeine.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure what these lines do, but when I comment them out the whole thing just stops working.32 and out of a toxic relationship for almost a year now. Back to working out after 12 years (a bus hit me and caused a massive back injury) and therapy for the first time in my life to deal with some toxic masculine traits and a need to solve everyone's problems and be their agony aunt, but not lean on anyone else. \n\nThere's lots of work to be done as therapy is best when you work on yourself and the therapist merely steers you, and consistency needed for getting up and in the gym every morning, but I'm feeling better than I have ever felt I could.\n\nMy biggest win recently was being able to touch my toes! I'm 6'4 and coupled with the back injury thought I'd never be able to do it!Yeah, i used to be a fuckin asshole in my 20s. partying spending thousands a month getting fucked up. selling drugs smoking, drinking gambling you name it i was doing it. then i broke my leg a couple years ago and started re evaluating my life. now i am back in school and getting my ducks in a row but holy fuck i was a menace in my 20s.It\u2019s amazing to see so many people becoming software engineers in their 30s to unfuck their lives. Seriously, best choice I\u2019ve ever made. Now I\u2019m making ~5x more than I made in any other job, no degree or experience. Anybody looking to turn things around, tech jobs are a great opportunity.SoI finally hit one year alcohol free and actually been taking uni seriously this time, I\u2019m 31 and life is suddenly offering me all these great opportunities and I can\u2019t help but think, \u201cthis is all going suspiciously well, what\u2019s the catch?\u201d There\u2019s no catch you idiot you\u2019re just doing things the right way lol.Technically, money is all it takes to fix most anything.Turning 40 in 16 days and I feel I just finally debugged. Bought a house in the Bay Area, new wife pregnant with my son, and all of it done in the last 6 months. Shit the wedding was last Sunday. Getting out of my 30\u2019s by the skin of my teeth and I could not ask for a more wonderful life.I am 4 years sober, I have 2 teeth left on my upper left side. My diet is still a mess but I start an actual grown up diet tomorrow. I'm 32 this year and this has been a process of unfucking of multiple years. But lawdy is it worth it.\n\nStick at it.Unfucked my financials at 31. And it felt like downloading 13tb of data over dialup speeds, then printing it on an old dot matrix printer, while the computer and all the paper is on fire, the building is being attacked by a tsunami and a tornado\u2026.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m paycheque to paycheque. Instead of paycheque to 3 days before paycheque. \n\nBut the Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.The 30s is distress for nuptialsI\u2019m stuck in an infinite loop.Try it your late 40's.This is all a matter of perspective. Nothing else matters to me as long as I'm happy, so unfucking your life is being realistic about what you're not happy with. You could be a millionaire surrounded by hot girls and you could be unhappy, so try and separate status quos and external bullshit to make the right call for you.\n\nIf you have the courage to do what's right for you after recognizing the problems, the rest of your life should be smooth sailing. In all the talks I've had with other people about this, it almost always boils down to them not facing their fears.ctrl + a   \ndelete\n\nWrite a new code. Your code.You mean because you scroll through the spaghetti for a bit, then close the windows and say \"... fuck it\"?Any advice for unfucking your life in your 30s when you have adhd and struggle to stick to a schedule/taskSame strategy for both that can lead to success: break it down into small, manageable pieces and keep making incremental changes that make things a little better.I will be 39 in 8 days... so I have 1 more year to debug the code that I have yet to debug.10 years of anxiety, depression, panic attacks and nasty nausea that game with all those...\nFew years ago I've been staring to get back on track with life and just had my 8th visit at dentist, so happy that after all the struggle and helplessness there is light at the end of the tunnel\n\nKeep fighting fellas\ud83d\udcaaI was an athlete in school, late teen bad decisions led to 20s depression and 70 extra pounds. I couldn't even tie my shoe and don't get me started on how bad sex got. But deciding to do better is the first step. I started last year when I was 31 I'm 32 and have lost 30 lbs. I had got it to 40lbs but I still struggle some days.yup and in your 40s and 50s its like someone handed you boxes of punch cards and says something doesnt work right.....I hate how accurate this isthis post somehow makes me feel a lot better. we can do this. thank youLiterally woke up at 6 this morning and told myself I needed to unfuck my life to make sure my wife and girls are taken care of. Seeing this solidified that im going to stick with it.Half the code was written by someone else, half was you trying to make the best of it without coding knowledge and learning along the way.Stop reading my diaryr/programmerhumor\"Who the fuck took out this credit card to pay for a plane ticket for a booty call that now has compound interest of nearly \u00a33000?\"Gotta work through that trauma sometime. Imagine it happening in your 70s! I have clients dealing with that.Oh my god. This hits so hard. I am currently unfucking my life in my 30s, and every time I try to unfuck one bug, my solution exposes ten more bugs. I go to the Dr. for one tiny thing, they schedule three new appointments to test other things. I finally get insurance and every time I try to use it, I find out all the ways insurance screws you. I buy a mattress, my car breaks down. I get promoted, my SO breaks their leg and can't work for four months. I want to find a new job, I don't have any energy because of burnout. I get ADHD meds, now I can't sleep.\n\nI constantly fantasize about starting a whole new build with all my current knowledge. This codebase is too fucked, just give me the time and resources to start from scratch and it will be so much better. But no. The universe is much like my bosses in that it will not give me time to properly unfuck anything.Please allow me to share this quote with you, in which I find great solace: \u201cwe\u2019re all fucked up, so what you wanna do, with fucked up me, and fucked up you?\u201d - Fred Durst.I keep waking up in rage at who messed me up\u2026.only to remember it was me\u2026.there is a point in Rick and morty where Rick goes back in time and talks to his younger self who is appalled by what he\u2019s turned into\u2026only for the older Rick to say that he should be the one who\u2019s mad since the younger version made him that wayReincarnate and start from scratch.In my thirties now, didn\u2019t think I would make it this far and left everything to \u201ccross that bridge later\u201d. Now all the bridges are here and for the first time in my life I like what I see across them. It\u2019s incredibly hard though to fix what I fucked up but only I can help myself. \n\nPower to everyone trying to make their lives one worth living, y\u2019all got this!Currently in the process of it. Trying to get a job as an electrical engineer after a few years in college and even more years in dead end jobs. What the hell was I thinking in my teens going for an animation degree in a country with a near extinct demand for it?Everyone thinks your teens are great but 20s will be the best before everything goes downhill at 30. \n\nIt\u2019s bs. Teens are crap cause you don\u2019t have anything and 20s you only pretend to have anything. 30s have been my best years so far and I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of themTrue. Got sober at 33.I\u2019m 33, about to turn 34 in less than a month. From about 24-30 my mind was collapsed from depression after I got out of the military. Somehow managed to get a 3.4gpa and obtain a bachelors in biology in that time . In class I sat in the back and never said a word to anyone. Ever. About the only time people would hear my voice was when I\u2019d give a presentation sometime during the last week. \n\nNow I\u2019m working as a wildland firefighter, in the best shape of my life. Still working on the mind issues though. Still trying to figure out how to find a worthwhile woman to share my life with. But as it stands, I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m not meant for anyone. Pretty good looking dude. Really amazing shape physically, just my mind sucks. It\u2019s so difficult for my to talk to people nowadays. \n\nMaybe my 40s will be different.Done both, would rather debug code.I'll try to unfuck my life before my 30's but it's super hard mentally, my life is a fucked up mess right now, financially, socially and psychologically.30s - lolAnd in my case (pushing 40) the debugging has turned to extinguishing smaller fires to avoid it all burns down.I want a respec like in video games. All of your non-consumable items are reset and you have nothing but the money you spent on everything. You now can spend that money on what you need, but without all the useless clutter.>Unfucking your life in your thirties\n\nI was supposed to do that in my thirties? Well...fuck.As the top comment is about dental health....yep.  I am 39 and finally getting my teeth fixed and its...amazing.  Sure, it hurts like a mother fucker with the work I am having done but the slow progress and additional 6 appointments I have that stretch into July (currently April 10, 2022) will be 100% worth it.\n\nDental insurance is a fucking luxury and I finally got it and it is paying for everything.  \n\nAlso, the pain.  Tooth pain is awful.  I had my left leg amputated a few years back due to a rare bone disease I have and I would 100% take that pain over my teeth and mouth pain...any day.  That's how awful tooth pain can get.Feeling this deep. \n\nI'm 38. \n\nTime for vacation. I've done a lot of this lately. \n\nI think I'm grown up now (and it kinda sucks sometimes only)You should be in a constant flow of fucking and unfucking your life.  Like hot patching an os.  You can't restart your life.Mushrooms helped me understand why I was so self destructive and depressed. Before my trip I always said, \u201c nothing matters and we\u2019re all going to die anyways.\u201d During my trip I felt my brain connecting dot that I didn\u2019t realize before and that everything matters. I got a haircut lost 40lbs. The world didn\u2019t owe me a damn thing and I needed to work at bettering myself. People now want to talk to me, it\u2019s such a weird feeling and I love it.Try it in your 50's \ud83d\ude44Even better in your forties, still got there though.this feels soooo real to me that i'm gonna bookmark it, compose myself and come back to the comments cuz I can feel the turmoil kicking up\"Midlife Crysis\"Try doing it in your 40s. It\u2019s an extra decade of fun!I'm not a coder, but does that feel anything like trying to steer a yacht with nothing but a paddle?\n\nIf so, I agree.I deleted some random code that seemed to do nothing but now trauma.exe won't stop running and everything is broken.One thing they don't tell you about coming out of depression is that all that behaviour now doesn't just stem from your depression, they are now habits engrained into your mind and you gotta drag yourself out ta THAT tooUnfucking it in your your thirties ain\u2019t as hard as in your forties. Anyway we\u2019re all fucked, thanks for listening, and pro-tip: leave comments for your future selfI started at 31 and it was the best thing I ever did for myself. 33 now and life is better than I could\u2019ve expected when I was a 30yo suicidal addict. Clean 855 days today and couldn\u2019t be happier.31 and it takes me hours to get out of bed. I have functioning depression. Nobody knows unless I want them to know. \n\nHalf the time I\u2019m charismatic and inspirational\u2014the other half, I\u2019m a zombie with tears in my eyes. It\u2019s the worst. \n\nI plan to start in about two months. I\u2019m moving to another city. Gym routine. Maybe a morning prayer to start the day. Phone cut off an hour before bedtime. Journaling. I miss healthy me.Try in your 40's cupcake \ud83e\uddc1\u201cThe only thing an old man can tell a young man is that it goes fast, real fast, and if you\u2019re not careful it\u2019s too late. Of course, the young man will never understand this truth.\u201d  \n\u2015 Norm Macdonald, Based on a True StoryAnd you never even learned coding. Good luck.Yet I\u2019m trying to do this in my 40\u2019s\u2026so overwhelmedWouldn't know. Haven't managed yetgrats if you manage to finish the debugging before 40.27 and I feel like things are falling apart. My body is wrecked from working kitchens, I have untreated illnesses, and no one is taking MediCal/I often get ghosted by therapists who I make appointments for virtual sessions with because everyone\u2019s brains are fucking fried from the pandemic and there\u2019s not enough mental health professionals that can handle the influx of people having breakdowns. I quit the food industry to get a better hang on life, a better job, make more friends, and to get out of the hell hole that is back of house. But now, even with a BS and years of lab experience and research, all the jobs I\u2019ve applied to either ghost me after 3 interviews, or I go through the limbo of being under and over-qualified for jobs that won\u2019t pay me for what my degree entails anyways.\n\nAll the while, my husband (33) is experiencing quite the opposite. He got a good paying job in the field he\u2019s always wanted to be in, is up for promotion, and his mental health is getting better. We met when he was 28 and going through a similar stage in life that I\u2019m currently at.\n\nI want to say his experience should put things in perspective for me, that things will work out cause they worked out for him. But really, I feel like I\u2019m on a razor\u2019s edge between feeling completely dejected and wanting to just say fuck all, and trying to hold on/be optimistic.One of those reddit threads where all these weirdos compete over who's the most fucked and try to normalize being hedonistic pieces of shitI recently hit 30 years old, I spent my 20\u2019s in a deep depression, and extremely low self esteem. I was constantly trying to find meaning to life or be something. \n\nSomething inside my brain clicked, I realized I\u2019m not here please anyone but myself, I don\u2019t need a meaning and I started to work out. I lost a lot of weight, gained a lot of muscle mass. I gained confidence in myself and suddenly I no longer felt depressed.\n\nRight off the bat, I started to receive compliment form people, I started to put way more effort at work since I no longer felt a huge weight over me. I got 2 promotions at work In less than 6 months. Life finally has started to feel enjoyable.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to get yourself out of a deep depression. I recommend getting help maybe even medication. Only you can save yourself. No one will get you out of where you are. It\u2019s all up to you.because you realize... allllllll these years you've been blaming other people for fucking you life, it was actually you all along!\n\nwhich also means you get to unfuck it!Uninstall and try again. Shouldn't there be a patch for this...YesJfc i resonated so hard with this it was like getting a punch to the gutalt+f4 timeThat was me.   Far too late in life to figure out the basics.Anyone in this thread who is feeling high and mighty, shit happens. My sibling was at the top until her late 40s and now shit is catching up and falling apart. It's like God is punishing her on top of it all, it's unreal to see. \n\nThen there is my ass. Family loser and then within a year I went from nothing to having my shit together and it just kept improving. My sister can't even talk to me anymore it's so triggering for her that we \"switched places\". Really highlighted how she saw me.Pro tip, start un fucking your self mid 20's so rolling into your thirties doesn't feel like crashing in F1In my defense, the program was supposed to discontinue at 25.This is the most reddit userbase indicative post of all time.I'll be 34 this year and I tell my kids (13 and 6) all the time that it's wild as hell being in your thirties. Your body ages so much faster than your mind.Long is the way and hard, that out of Hell leads up to light\n\n~ John MiltonI\u2019m trynna unfuck my life in my twenties and it\u2019s barely moving at allThat is true.  Unfuck you life as early as possible,  and make a big rainy day fund for the next time life tries to fuck you.  If you get unlucky,  going from one shit show to the next with no real means of fixing them,  shit gets old.God this is too accurateIts also very rewarding. You come to the other side as a grizzled life vet, that smiles in the face of fuckery, adversity, and self sabotage. \n\nAnd similar to debugging horrible legacy code, you will feel great relief when finished.Leave it till the 40s[deleted]Did you make your bed this morning?Dude, why are you making posts about my life?Too bad there isn't life stack overflow.it's really hard. i'm in the midst of it. but one step, one day at a time. brick by brick, we'll get thereAs someone who has been a binge drinker for 10-12 years. I decided to quit drinking at 28. I want to enjoy my 30s.I was a mainframe COBOL programmer until I retired at the end of 2021.  I can confirm that there is some hellacious legacy code out there which we **did not touch** unless absolutely necessary, because if it was working, we didn\u2019t want to break it.  I had to fix some of that kind of code in late 2020, and hoo boy, what a spaghetti mess.How do you unfuck your life and where can i learn this power?Preach... ive been in therapy for 2 years and haven\u2019t even scratched the surfaceYa 37/m wife of 16 years walked out this weekend. No freaking clue how to recover.None of these words are in the BibleIt feels at times as though I was given a machine and taught basic and told that was the only language available and finally found out there were a thousand other ones only after I hit a point where it feels like doing anything different won't make any meaningful difference for anything in my life. I spent so long just making little screensavers and wasted so much time instead of learning that it's too late to do it now.\n\nAnd that's probably depression talking but it's pretty hard to feel like you have worth when you've got nothing to prove it.I\u2019m 34, just started building my credit a year ago because I knew I would ruin it in my 20\u2019s. I\u2019m up to 703 and finally feel like an adult.I picked the wrong career and am starting over in my late 30\u2019s \ud83d\ude2333 and just finally started therapy. holy fuck has this been labyrinth of shit to unpackUnfucking your life in your forties is exhausting and feels fucking impossible.Specially with horrible parent classes with code you didn't write yourself.Missuss of 14 years just walked out on me. Try doing it at 49 years old..thirties? make that 17 turning 18Turning 30 next month! I was just sitting here on the shitter browsing the interwebs in deep contemplation on how im gonna unfuck my life these next 10 years! Cheers \ud83c\udf7b50 here.  it\u2019s like COBOL with all the comments written in EsperantoI tell my patients every day tooth paste is cheap, my dental work is not. Sorry, I owe over 350K on student loans to do what I do. I have to pay for it and I\u2019m sorry it sucks for those that shoulder the costMotivatorI am 22 and i feel this100% accurateFeels like going through an old Ableton project where the samples are \"not found\", plugins are broken or 10 years outdated, but that midi still there so it's gonna be okay...I am 35 and waiting for a kidney transplant because an auto immune disease destroyed my kidneys.  To say it feels like an up hill battle is an understatement.  After I get the kidney I will have to somehow survive while paying for expensive anti rejection drugs.As someone trying to unravel 3 and a half decades of my own programming (meaning I don\u2019t blame anyone but myself), this really resonates. I have trouble trying to cope with maybe I have been a piece of shit con man and that\u2019s all I\u2019m good at. I have anger issues.  Luckily not outwardly physical, but I have trouble understanding why people don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m mad sometimes. I know it\u2019s unhealthy, but it almost feels like new me has to put down the old me like a rabid dog and that I\u2019m essentially killing part of myself regardless of how terrible they might be.Life is dumb. I\u2019m 35 trying my \u201chardest\u201d to be a real person by 40. Not looking too good tbh lmfao. Fuck itUnfucking your life once you\u2019ve hit 40 ends up in high level reform or a stuntman\u2019s deathI read life as wife and think I need to go to sleep now.Fuck,  I'm still working that outMy teeth look like a grenade went off in my mouth.Painful, but ultimately worth it?\n\nI feel that.r/programmerhumorTruly.I feel seen and heard , what an OxymoronThis one hit way too close to home.  Thanks...Yep, that is a correct analogy.This is true no matter your age. But the older one is, the worse the consequences. Imagine being 50 with no retirement savings. Future you is fucked if it is not turned around fast, with the number of years of useful work years remaining ever-present in your mind. Sucks to live in a country without universal healthcare. Might as well give up when my health inevitably goes south in a decade or two.Am I supposed to know what this means?I successfully unfucked my life at 17 and now I'm running into the next big fuck within the coming months. It's a steady process and we have to keep at it to stay afloat.YesAin't no lie, I'm glad my 30s are nearly over \ud83e\udd23\"who the fuck even did this? oh, it was me\"\n\nall the way down\n\noh manWe are dealing with horrible legacy code, set up and abandoned by previous generation who used this planets resources like locusts and said \u201cfuck off, I got mine\u201d to everything and everyone else. Shit is fucked.I was a loser in my 20s. Couldn't hold a job. Drinking way too much. Smoking pot every day.  I don't know exactly what the turning point was.  Some time around 28 I stopped doing that shit. I'm 32 now and I own a house with my wife. I run a profitable bike shop out of my garage with my free time.  I'm living the millennial version of the American dream.\n\n(Also I'm Canadian, not American, so I get free healthcare too)How is your life fucked? My life is great except I just want a wife and finding a quality one is extremely hard at 32. My standards aren\u2019t even high at all. The problem is that the ones I like don\u2019t like me, and the ones I don\u2019t like are the ones that like me lmao.Blessed to have done this at 17. For those of you saying there\u2019s not much to unf***, you would be very surprised\u2026This hit me harder than will smith did chris rock.Your 30\u2019s is when you should start fixing things? Good to know I don\u2019t have to fix anything yet. I found out recently ago the fish I have been eating isn\u2019t microwaveable and is 100% raw thank god I found out on my 6th box.Except it\u2019d have to be refactored entirely so just debugging it wouldn\u2019t change shit so this is kind of a stupid fucking title but okis this some kind of old people joke of wich i'm too young to understand?Quit yer bitchen! Try multiple cluster fucks post forty and staying on your feet.Me a trans woman learning to code \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbbCry me a fucking river... Lots of other redditors did it their first time in their early 20's, and then their 30's, and then AGAIN in their late 30's, and then their early 40's, and then late... Etc, Etc...\n\nLegacy is inconvenient compared to ex in-laws and all of the ilk associated with them. Lol.\n\nSuck it up buttercup. If it was easy, everyone would do it...Get children, you guys have way to much time.doubt people really know what it\u2019s like to debug legacy codeI feel this. I started working on a game that i didnt finish 10 years ago, and I hate myself for it.Pull request denied.It is ok to just admit the fact that you fucked it up and start over from (somewhat) scratch. I may \"start over\" with negative income, but at least I know how to read and write and basic maths so.. maybe it cancels out? People start off under way worse conditions than that.So that\u2019s normal?? I thought i was aloneI wonder what a fucked 30 something existence would beMore like trying to get steam to work on a chromebook.Fuck i feel this. Feel like I've been trying for a while and it's just a mess.I know the person that wrote the shitty code. What can we patch up first? Highest up vote gets the cake.Instructions please.Good dayCan you explain \"legacy code\" term please?its worse than that.  its two full time jobs,  debugging legacy code and lots of phone support because the current buggy version is still in productions causing all kinds of situations that need to be un fucked.Honestly, the hardest thing ever, mentally. Especially when the only way to do it was moving location where you know no-one. I have family not far away but that's completely different. Social life and love life nonexistent which sucks when you want to start settling down. A shitty ass flat and now you rent, you're duck in that horrible cycle because paying bills to not being able to save enough for a mortgage as renting is more expensive. \nPuts you in a dark placeI'm proud of y'all for trying. I gave up a while back and I'm just waiting til my frustrations with reality peakThen I\u2019m working off of a Mainframe COBOL code base.Yeah but I\u2019m over here only knowing HTML and CSS. Like I\u2019m 33 and still need to learn JS!? Wtf. Then by the time I learn I\u2019m just started anyways and all the cool kids are laughing because I even remember html and css. Fml.Better than never doing it.Tell me about it.  Feel like I spent that last couple years deciding if I was in hell or limbo.As it happens, I'm unfucking my life in my 30s BY debugging horrible legacy code.Imagine what if feels to do that at the same time... sigh....I'm in no way a coder, but this sounds accurate.As someone who turned 30 today, I can\u2019t wait\u2026.Holy shit, man. This one hit hard.Sounds legit!Wow, great analogy for change. It\u2019s worth it though!Glad it's not just me \ud83d\ude02[deleted]My twenties was one continuous bad mental state....and a lot of fun.It's true, but you shouldn't say itI completely agreeThis is the ultimate shower thought.Feels to me like if you know what legacy code is you shouldn't be too bad off \ud83d\ude09Why are 90% of the posts on this sub just terrible computer metaphors?Soo truee!!!Mid 30s here. You guys are unfucking your lives?Just make sure to keep your mistakes DRY and your principles SOLIDI've spent a lot of time deciphering engineering drawings from the 80s that have been xerox'd to death.\n\nThat's my equivalent metaphor.I feel this post.I wish I would have just left the old code running and not fucked with a mediocre thing.Especially bad when the program mostly works except for the one glitch that pops up at the most inopportune times that can never quite be fixed.Been working on it for a while now... Seems impossible.I have never related so much to a Reddit postOof. Yes. But the relief of success is worth it.I have no idea what horrible legacy code is but I still felt this.Thanks,I needed to hear something positive about approaching 30 rapidly whilst continuing to fuck upAs a dev with daddy issues, this feels targeted.I haven\u2019t felt anything so deep in a hot minute.Come on man why you gotta do me like thatThis is why I\u2019m starting in my mid 20s. Gonna fix some shit, then maybe chill out a bit.Try doing it at 40 while also transitioning!! I\u2019m like wtf dude!?!?Try doing it in texas with a felony background.Wait till you get to your forties.But instead of technical debt, it's just debt.Try it when you are 50!!!!this is actually pretty accurateChildhood trauma survivor here too. 28. Severe ptsd and constant dissocative symptoms. \n\nMy parents are failures. \n\nListen, you are not the failure. Your parents were.Can confirm. 40 and still debugging*laugh/cries in genx*For sure, but mostly I'm just dealing with the shit legacy code my parents gave me lmaoKeep going. It gets better with age. Just remember: Noone ever stops unfurling their life. Every one us always, if they are honest,  continue finding things we need to fix about ourselves.Wait til your 40hahaha jokes on you. im gonna wait till my 40s! XDThen you run git blame to figure out what idiot wrote it only to discover it was you from like 10 years agoCan confirm, have 1.1 years left and almost unfucked. Started around 33To everyone that is going through the absolute panic of not having enough time remember this quote, \n\n\"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now\".\n\n\nYou guys have got this!So, Am I getting there, yes?I just woke up. I didn't want to feel this pain so early in the day.How about unfucking your life in your 40s?Unfucking your life in your mid 20s is interestingThis is accurate.I spent most of my 20s shutting off unhelpful commentary from my father in my head. Welcome to the resistance, it gets better.Ha,  try it in your 40s. But the main thing is recognizing it and fixing it.Amen brother.   Filing Chapter 7 later this month and divorce will be finalized shortly thereafter.Oh this rings way too true to me (34 year old software engineer). In my case it's mental/emotional health based on all of my past behaviors, so the horrible legacy code is really a perfect metaphor.Wait for your 40ies\u2026prometheus rising by robert anton wilson is an interesting read on the metaprogramming of the biocomputers we call our brain. offers practices and methods of changing your reality tunnel and to get you out of your BS( belief system)I don't think I'm doing that well till I encounter friends that don't know things and I've had to go through it already and can help them. And it makes me realize I'm ahead of the game compared to a lot my age.[deleted]I turn 42 this year and am just now realizing how much better shape (financially and physically) I could be if I would have gotten my shit together in my early thirties.   \n\nIt may feel late now, but when you're 50 it will seem like a lifetime ago.Try unfucking your life in your 30s, while learning to code.Yes.  Looking at it that way is encouraging, though, because it doesn't feel like a personal failing.  All code is buggy, every system sucks to some degree, and this is just the situation you're in.  So it's frustrating but not as frustrating as if you went into it expecting everything to be cupcakes and pony rides.  I think life is sadder for people who expect a perfect working system.Then my \u201cget my shit together by 30\u201d plan that I designed and began to implement at age 27 means I was making Architect level moves.I remember being like \"ah shit I spent all my skill points on funny but mean comebacks. Now I've got no points for emotional regulation and loving communication\". \n\nTurns out with enough therapy you can respec your character.Without the documentation\\*Oh... we were debugging?  \n\nI was still furiously digging my hole deeper.LOL im doing it at 41!I am not a programmer of any sort. But if this deep seated frustration and irritation is what a programmer does, then they get it coming & goingOops. You drank and ate yourself to a 280 pound diabetic with hypertension and high cholesterol before age 35. Better change every thing you\u2019ve ever come accustom to if you want to live passed 45.Imagine debugging in your forties, nightmare legacy code.Life is like bideo gameyeaLife is like bideo gameThought this was [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor)Am 40. GGHey, I resent that.  I created tons of that 'Legacy Code' back in the early 90s - Y2K.  Tons of banking software that if most likely currently running behind the scenes at tons of American banks.\n\nSeriously.  Stuff we wrote in 1989 had to be Y2K'ed because banks are so cheap that they use the same old systems FOREVER.\n\nIn the late 90's they just slapped a web interface on top of the old Tel-Net login banking people were using for ACH/Money Transfers/Money Market Investment/Check Stop Payments but the code on the Main Frame stayed the same.\n\nI got out of the industry after Y2K, I still miss the problem solving aspect of it, and the MONEY (Teaching does not make 1/2 what you can make coding, plus PARENTS are ASSHOLES (kids arent much better)).Wait until your 40's...Why do i have to keep paying for professional certifications out of pocket. I need them to get a job that doesn\u2019t pay me terribly, but my terrible paying job doesnt pay enough to afford certification tests. I\u2019m the problem right? i just need to get better at winning and get another part time job to spend 2 months salary on one test attempt?Better late than never31, obese (132kg all time high), ex-junkie, depression and anxiety at astronomical levels, libido at record low...  \nFew months ago, i started to eat cleaner. At first, just avoiding added sugar on food and cooking more with organic products, like rice, onion, garlic instead of premade spice. Forced myself to drink at least 2 litre of water daily, almost became a pee machine, but i was feeling a **tiny bit** better. \n\nInstead of getting the bus to work, I'm commuting by bike for the past 10 months. I get a daily dose of sun (Vitamin D) and a tiny bit of workout and less than a month in this new routine my body started to feel more rigid, cleaner, overall better.\n\nI'm back at the gym now, still commuting by bike, eating cleaner by the day, avoiding stuff that makes me feel with bad, avoiding foods that makes me fart, have heart burns, feel stuffed or barely able to move. 8 months with no cigarrete (just the daily weed), 112kg and dropping and feeling better by the day, but at the same time realizing that you MUST make effort and active thinking in good things, avoiding bad things, to keep on track.\n\nIf you are struggling at 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, don't think about the age, think that if you don't start something NOW, in two years you will be at the same spot. You better at least start slow, then. Make an analogy with a book you trying to read: better to read a sentence daily than none. In two years, you might finish that book in your own pace. One push up daily is better than zero. One walk around the block is better than just using the stairs, but using the stairs is better than staying in the couch. Before quitting smoking forty cigarretes daily (2 packs), I started to smoke thirty, then 20, then 10! After that, i tried to hold at mornings for the first one and avoiding the one before bed, considering I'll be sleeping and won't need it. \n\nDon't think about doing it, just get up and GO. Complain while doing, not before starting. Your life will be better, and you will unscrew your bad habits.Do tell.You lost all your friends in the summer between elementary school and middle school, and you *never* found new ones? *Never ever?!?*Accurate.i tried unfucking {can i say fucking/?) my life in my late 20's i got married insteadUnhappily, I must admit that this pung something inside.This whole thread has helped me feel seen!30 here, and still can\u2019t say no to anybody to the point where I\u2019m broke & miserable. \ud83d\ude2dMy life seemed absolutely perfect through my twenties but right here at the cusp of 30 and my Spouse has become actively suicidal, said they have been faking their personality for 10 years, and suddenly refuses to get out of bed to eat or anything.\n\nBut she adopted a dog despite me actively saying don't do that, so now we are fighting about everything tooIts hard but worth it. 27 and just now have clear goal and means to achieve itIdk I started a company 5 years ago, sold out and have a new position at a company very similar to mine. I feel like I ran into legacy code at 23 but now turning 29 I am excited to see what's next. I'll tell you how it goes in 3 years lol, remindmeHopefully im ahead of the curve for once and doing this/mostly done at 25Better than in your 50\u2019s\u2026by then the code is really buggy.Unfortunately my life is written in Fortran.This hits way too hard right now.If your under 35 just join the armyIt really is, and I actually love this part about my life.Tell me about it man, I had a breakdown earlier because my credit score dropped 15 points because a debt collector is trying to collect a medical debt that my insurance already paid, and they refuse to remove it event hough it's already been paid.Got sober at 34. Wish I had done it years ago, but at least I stopped. Nearly 4 years later, I\u2019m doing well, not where I want to be by any means but my life has improved immensely.Wait till you get to your 40s. Its like debugging code that's partially encrypted.r/ProgrammerHumorSame as the 50s and 60sI declare bankruptcy!!!!!Try it in your mid-forties. Nearly fucking impossible, especially because you just don\u2019t have the energy anymore along with all sorts of new *responsibilities*.Ahh But it is the BEST time to unfuck your life!Doing this at 25 trying to undo so many bad habits and pieces of bad software up there. It\u2019s causing me a lot of personal grief but I\u2019m hoping the struggle means I\u2019m getting somewhereI went there opposite routeAs someone who\u2019s in his 30s, trying to better them self AND learning to code/web dev\u2026I feel this so hardI hate debuggingI unfucked my life around 27 so I'd hit my 30s  \nsmooth. It worked outThis is a good thing. Stopping the spred is more important than their civil liberties.If I knew how to do that, I might be having less problems.If my life was a Dark Souls run, I would have re-spec'd by now.Today it feels more like repairing a server room after a virus outbreak (thanks COVID economic fallout)Fuckin\u2019 A\u2026. It really doesYou can unfuck your life in your thirties by learning to debug horrible legacy code.Finally at a point where I can say \u201cfuck it, it ain\u2019t pretty but it works, I got other shit to deal with and dgaf what other people think of my code. The important thing is to ship the life experiences I want\u201dWhat happens in the 40s?Who wrote this? Oh me\u2026Try doing it in your mid to late 40s.Almost 32 and realizing I'm trans. It's never too late to start doing it right, to start loving life. Forgive yourself, because you weren't making mistakes, you were just finding who you are!Wait until your 50s.I feel this. Started going to therapy three years ago when I was 36 to deal with childhood trauma of losing my dad when I was 9 and then being sexually abused by a family member starting when I was 11. Turns out that stuff follows you when you get older! But yeah starting therapy is like looking at a train wreck and trying to decide where to even start unfucking things.Never touch a running system.Can't wait18, i think i caught myself early. trying to turn around so when i really start stepping it\u2019s in the right directionSee also \"why am I a thirty year old with braces?\"Only 23, but I had really bad depression the last two years and dental health was one of those things which went with my mental health. Only a couple years gone and my teeth are already fucked in some ways, pits and brown spots... At least I'm keeping them clean now, but man it's a real bummer when I have to see the scars of my depression in the mirror every morning, though it also makes me remember why I can't give up, so silver linings and all.Dude. This is why I am such a stickler for my thirteen year old brushing her goddamn teeth. Please take care of your teeth folks!I was lucky to have gotten a single bitcoin from some advertisement in maybe 2010? I think it was neopets maybe? Anyways that fixed my teeth.Yooo I'm getting ready to shell out 6 grand on dentures. I'm 32 and haven't been to a dentist in like 20 years.Never brushed. Now I have to have all my my molars removed. One of which has a gaping hole and an exposed nerve.\n\nI can't tell you what dental nerve pain feels like, but I can tell you I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.I got my dental issues finally settle a couple months after turning 30, after about 2 years of uncomfortable appointments and gauze.\n\nSo so so so glad I did it's like how people say you just want enough money to not have to worry about money.  Well not worrying about your teeth is a gift worth nearly the same.Just turned 25 and im pretty sure ive got a cavity that I havent taken care of in a year.......fuck why does going to the dentist have to be so expensive.I\u2019m looking into updating the dental hardware with the Invisalign patch, but I\u2019ve heard it costs a lot of credits.I know him, he is meMy mother was terrified of dentists. I didn\u2019t have a dentist look at my teeth until I was in my 20\u2019s and a tooth got so bad it needed removed. \n\nIt would have been bad enough, but she is also instilled horrible oral hygiene habits into us kids. \n\nThank god for puberty. I wouldn\u2019t have a tooth in my head if taking care of your mouth wasn\u2019t an important part of kissing girls.I should really make that fucking appointment.Wtf... Kinda glad I'm not the only one who let my teeth go to shit before hitting my 30's, but it's also kinda makes it sadder that I'm not the only oneTo the people in this thread talking about how mental health or neurodivergence makes it tough to do self-care tasks like toothbrushing - see KC Davis' content! There are things you can do to make it easier for yourself, like keeping pre-pasted toothbrushes around (you can order them in bulk) so you can brush from your bed or wherever you happen to be. You are worth taking care of, it's ok to need some hacks to make that achievable.*Toggles git blame in the IDE...* Sh*t, it was me.THIS. My dentist makes those comments every time I go in. I don\u2019t know how else to tell him I only gained a sense of self-preservation as of like a year ago.Ok, I needed to read this. My oldest F25 does this. Tooth brushing is like the first thing to go when she gets really depressed. Shes had 3 visits in the last 5-7 years where shes had at least 6-8 cavities. And then schedules to go in and have 5 done at once and freaks half way thru. They're gonna put a note on her chart not to schedule more than 3 at once. Our dentist is a saint. I don't know what's going to happen when she switchs to her husbands insurance next year. Any advice welcome.I feel like once I enter my 30s (currently 31)I could actually finically deal with things that I couldn\u2019t in my 20s- my dental issues didn\u2019t smile all through my 20s cause crooked mess, granted I have had some success in my sales role which lead to greater opportunities but in my 20s I was helpless barely affording 600$ room for rent. It gets better!Hey, same age, two years into the process -- it's fucking painful (at least at times) but totally worth it.  \n\nThe key for me was to take any improvement in behavior as a win: Did ONE sit-up instead of none? Win. Went outside for two seconds instead of staying in the whole day? Win.  \n\nAlso, facing your bad traits honestly is necessary to be a better you, and owning up to them **doesn't make them worse**. Remember that when you get scared, because you will.  \n\nGood luck to you, if you keep at it the little things start adding up and you get stronger even as your burden gets lighter. It's nice to start being grateful for your habits instead of remorseful! Go get 'em, this life is yours!31 and in the same boat. Let's do this shit.It is worth it. As I have gotten older, I have taken better care of myself. And small steady progress has paid off major. \n\nDon\u2019t let perfection be the enemy of progression. Any improvement is great.Remember that the only failure is not trying.It happens fast, but painfully slow at the same time. And the worst is the things that you know need to be fixed, but you can't do it alone and you can't get other people to see what you see. A year and a half ago I realized that every aspect of my life was in ruin. Work, children, wife, and myself. I was failing on every front, despite the effort I was putting in. A year and a half later the only changes I've been able to really make stick, are the ones involving myself. Everything else required cooperation, which is hard to get unless everyone is on the same page.While there\u2019s life, there\u2019s hope. You got this.2 years into my journey, turning 36 this year. It gets better, but it takes time. \n\nYou can do it. Remember to stop and appreciate where you are, how far you've come from where you started, and where you still have to go.Godspeed and good luck to you man.44 and two psychotherapists later, and I've learned I will only be better off single, so I had better get used to it.I just turned 36 and ok exactly the same boat.It's not too late! Currently 39 and still unfucking things from the pandemicThis gives hope to meWell untucking your life is significantly easier than unfucking it.What has been your favorite age so far? When were you happiest?Working on that now. M 34. Been an alcoholic since i could legally drink. Serious history of multiple addictions. The only thing i am really still having trouble with is the booze. I smoke weed but if i didnt i would be fine. Same with cigs. I have recently been entertaining the idea of stopping the booze. Got a week and was awesome. But that wagon came back down the road and i jumped back on it after a week. Wagon picked up some speed and i was scared to get close to the edge, let alone fall off. Well it has slowed down now. To a considerable rate at to which i could actually jump off it.  Just a drunk man's thoughts about his life. Have a good day. Thanks.Kids of all ages are welcome to ask for help at /r/internetparents.Nah you just need an \u201cadultier\u201d adultThats normal, you can't know it all or have had a chance to learn it all.  Humans are social, lean into that.When I'm in trouble I always ask for the help of some one older then me and say 'i need an adult'\n\nDon't give a shit sometimes. Might be 31 now but we always need an adult.I've always wondered, at what age you start thinking like an adult?\n\nIt never really happens. You're still the same person you were as a kid, just know more \n\nThen you realize everyone is in the same boat, even world leaders. And that's a terrifying thought.Bro I\u2019m 47 and I just realized why younger people keep asking for my advice about shit. In my mind I\u2019m this young guy who doesn\u2019t know shit about fuck and even though I still don\u2019t know shit about fuck people ask for my advice because\u2026 I\u2019m fucking 47. They think I\u2019m wise or something? I\u2019m like \u201cdamn I was going to ask you the same thing.\u201dIt's fine, everyone does that. There's always an adultier adult.   \n  \nAnd it's not an age thing, either. There's also times when someone younger than me that is more used to that specific situation is the one who's more fit to adult at the time.  \n  \nSometimes I am the adult, sometimes I'm in no condition to be and need one. That's just life.  \nAging doesn't automatically makes you know what to do in any situation, nor does it mean you're always emotionally stable at any given time.You can legit ask the guy from \u201cDad! How do I \u2026?\u201d. One can be surprise how much you can learn from a dad you didn\u2019t have at 30\u2019s.\n\nThat should fix some dependency errors.I just recently stopped saying \"I need an adult!\" I'm 32 lmfaoI looked for adults to help me as well\u2026 finally found a really kind tax guy to help me get caught up on taxes. Found a therapist who is very kind and professional but who also understands my snarky-dark humor. Found a handyman who doesn\u2019t judge my lack of husband. Honestly it always sounded so fancy, but not having a core group of handlers is more expensive. \n\nAlso, the twitter folks who talk about neurodivergence (I\u2019m debilitatingly ADD) in proactively helpful, non-grandstanding ways has been helpful as well.And I am the Reddit Video PlayerSponsored by RealPlayer[removed]It doesnt really matter we all are in a race to the grave take it easy and enjoy.You helping out friends in your 30\u2019s? \n\nEveryone\u2019s running their own carnival of human suffering. No one is there for each other like they use to be in my life. Everyone\u2019s on their own.You actually have friends in your 30s? Sounds like you're doing pretty wellIterative unfucking or Agile Adulting. Just do a retro and try again next sprint.\"You're supposed to have your salary in your 401k by 30\" lmfaoBruhOceans are rising with nuclear winter on the horizon. Calm down doctor. Now is not the time for fear, that comes later.Try to look on the bright side. It could be a lot worse. You could be in a relationship with someone you don't like, be saddled down with kids, crippling medical debt, a terminal or lifelong condition, could be in jail for a crime you didn't commit and so on and so forth. You are still free with a full life of choices ahead of you.lol this isn\u2019t a shower thought at till.. it\u2019s a \u201cstory of my life\u201d attack. :| \n\nHowever, I did just get my credit score raised 100pts in the last year. \nI have 2 job offers right now (one will be my first job with 401k stuff and benefits!). \nRent is going up in June for me :( 8% increase.\n\nAnd\u2026 I\u2019m poor so I have state insurance, at least.Capitalism is a traitor lunatic indeed.25 and 32. feeling good. easier the 2nd time.I also unfucked my life at 24... in my mid-thirties, should I wait until my forties, to try again... if it only affected me, this decision would be easy, like last time...Can we learn more from your unfuckery missions please? What worked, what didn't, how did it worknah i just create bugs for a livingAt 35, my brain says 25, but my knees are screaming 65.It\u2019s young if you\u2019re healthy and have money.\n\nIf you had a fucked up childhood which left you with health issues and no money and limited income potential 30 is not youngBut this is the oldest I've ever been!This is me. I\u2019m using a plastic Taco Bell spork.Swiss Army knife my ass. It\u2019s more like the plastic Black & Decker toy tool sets.Fuck yeah! Go you.You are what I want to be when I grow up! I'm 27 thoughIts interesting to me that every reply skipped over those 3 little words. I'm so sorry that happened to you, and I'm so happy you had the strength to overcome it and accomplish your goals. Go you!A lot of people panic at 30, but if you focus on work life balance, as cheesy as that sounds, it's far from over then. I know a ton of people who are currently keeping a childhood passion way into their fifties.Did cutting everyone and everything out improve things?Isn\u2019t that targeted harassment?Attacked on Sunday smhI seriously unfucked myself in my 30s. Where I\u2019m at now just over a decade later would have seemed impossible then. Believe in yourself. Keep working. Prove yourself to yourself in many different ways - and just keep doing it. 30s are a still very youthful and exploratory time. It\u2019s a great time of life to build foundations. \n\nGood luck.Like some others have said, sometimes you have to move away from home to start the processWhat, you potentially have two more entire 30 year  lifetimes ahead of you, and this time you'll actually be a capable adult the whole time\n\nPotential for two whole re-dos of the entirety of your lived experience to this pointNow imagine being 61 years old, having spent your entire life from 6 yrs on taking care of others and neglecting your own health and well-being, and you\u2019ve got maybe 10 yrs to unfuck your life and health.\n\nMy mother breaks down crying frequently because of her situation. She wants to be better now, but has difficulty making even the smallest changes to fix things. It\u2019s a slow process\u2014far slower than either of us would like\u2014but she *is* making progress. I only hope she\u2019s able to fix her health quickly enough that she gets more than another 10 yrs.Anytime I start to feel old I just turn on some motorhead and read stories about Lemmy. Dude had a young soul his entire life and showed me that age is just a mindset. In his words, \"If you think you're too old to rock n roll, then you are.\"Just wait til you get older lolI JUST started really cleaning up my shit at 34. 10 months since I started and I'm a completely different, far healthier and happier person. It's absolutely doable. It fucking SUCKS sometimes but it's 100% worth it.one year of selfcare has reduced those things by a solid 90%Oh shit if I had done this at 26 instead of 33. Count yourself lucky. The sooner, the betterBe kind to your past self. And 26 is a great age to start taking care of this stuff. Lots of folks don't start till their mid-30s or even later.The retirement one is rough. So many student loans to pay off, how can people in their 20s possibly be saving for retirement during their \"prime\" years? Or saving up for a down payment? My student loans financially crippled me until I was like 28, and they were nothing compared to what graduates have now. I was fortunate enough that my wife didn't have any at all, I can't imagine how difficult it would've been if she had debt coming out of school as well.The median net worth of a person in their 20s is about $8,000.\n\nYou\u2019re really probably doing ok. Your financial picture can look *totally* different by the time you\u2019re 30 if you\u2019re starting now. \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up homie, you\u2019re probably in a more typical spot than you think figuring this stuff out when most people start to.I think what really fucked us (in my 30s as well) was boomers telling us to go to college so we can live the \u201cAmerican dream.\u201d What they didn\u2019t tell us was the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d actually left the train station along time ago before graduation and they were the mysterious train conductors all along. \n\nWhen we asked our high school career counselors \u201cwhat\u2019s the best route to take in-order to be successful?\u201d They said \u201cjust go to college to earn a degree!\u201d We replied \u201cearn a degree in what?\u201d They replied \u201cjust get a degree and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Well, a lot of us earned degrees that didn\u2019t really advance jack shit in our lives, coupled with almost unbearable student loan debt. In retrospect it feels like we were setup for failure. \n\nRight now, I wish I was 18 in regards to the current state of the internet. Today, I can google which professions are a complete waste of time and don\u2019t pay worth a shit. I can take free online courses to help strengthen my skills and know what a hirable resume looks like. I can also google the fastest growing jobs in the next 10 years and which ones pay the most. \n\nInstead we had to listen to a career counselor\u2019s gut feeling.Nah, just keep the upwards trend going and slowly the fuckery goes away and feeling like a responsible adult comes through.\n\nTimes have been rough for myself but change is happeningJust FYI, we are warriors. We got handed shit sandwiches literally CENTURIES in the making, and we just bore down and healed it. \u270aHey I just want to say rock on. Recognize yourself for the hard work of breaking the generational trauma wheel. You're doing the best you can for your kids and you know it. \u2764\ufe0f Find peace on your journey!No it isn\u2019t.\n\nBut thanks, I do play my strengths and it\u2019s going well for me.\n\nI think it\u2019s key to recognize life is short and thus properly strategize your life, otherwise you\u2019ll keep thinking you have enough time to improve and never do it.Care to throw a few tips my way? I'm working in construction as an electrician, and my body isn't coping well, and I'm dealing  with some questionable personalities at work as well and it's taking a toll on my mental state as well since (I know it sounds weak, but it feels as if some of my superiors are taking out their issues on me knowing full well I can't leave the job yet because I need stable income in order to help out my mom and sisters). I'm thinking of starting to learn Python just to get an understanding of the profession at first.\n\nBasically, what could you recommend to a complete newbie?Congrats on 1 year alcohol free!!!We're very similar and I have the same thoughts everyday.The imposter is inside us all, and I feel like 30 was where I learned to start telling him to shut the fuck up cause we're trying something different for onceExactly. Working full time I can't afford therapy and rent so I'm stuck.Great job on 4 years. I don't have first hand experience with addiction, but I can tell that it's hard as fuck.

Right there with you man. I have been feeling waves of regret, self loathing, fear and dread. Something I read this morning that was slightly helpful to me is \u201cThe end of a long chapter doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of your story.\u201d Reach out to your friends and family and talk through it. I\u2019m finding that something like this is a unique human experience, and there\u2019s obviously no going around it, but only going through. Hope you have a decent network of people. I am willing to talk if you need someone in a similar situation. I may not respond quickly but definitely an ear.He didn\u2019t really hit him that hardWorst advice ever.[Fuck that](https://youtu.be/RbCJK1-yhnk)Happy birthday!!Because 90% of the community are just terrible programmers.Keep going, you will get used to it and things will slowly but steadily get better until it will actually become hard to go back where you came from. Change the direction and stay on that path, everything else will fall into place over time.how-to-guide plswhat you doing for it?oklink pls27 here and I should do the sameI actually loved debugging.  I felt like a detective looking for clues to seek out a murderer.  (Unless, of course, my boss was telling me that she needed the results yesterday.  That kind of pressure wasn\u2019t fun.)what did you do?I feel attacked.The pandemic was the perfect time to get braces since you can keep your mouth covered while out in public. I guess you still can wear the mask since people are used to seeing it now.At least you didn't get braces when you were in 6th grade, a time when i didn't have any dental hygiene habits whatsoever and parents who only cared enough to spend the money and then nag me about it, and now I'm 24 with permanent stains all over my teeth no matter how good my dental hygiene has been and is nowMy wife and I fought for years before I finally convinced her that braces will change her life. I wasn\u2019t wrong'Because my parents had a favorite and it wasn't me' us my answer.Same here. Depression got me for a couple years and I had to get 9 cavities filled when I came out of it. Now I'm back in it again, and though I started brushing well again a few weeks ago, I almost definitely picked up a couple more cavities.Nothing can\u2019t be fixed, tell your dentist your concerns and they can give options. I don\u2019t mentions permanent stains if the patient doesn\u2019t bring it up as I don\u2019t want to make anyone self conscious of something they weren\u2019t before. Best part of my day is when I make someone enjoy looking in the mirror.Get her flossing young, too! It's arguably more important than brushing but for some reason seems more difficult to form into a habit for most people.\u201cSo this is covered in my health insurance that I pay for every check and *never* utilize right?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLol.\u201dMy daughter is 4 and she goes to the dentist every six months. Meanwhile, I\u2019m over here with a 9 year gap between visits. I finally decided to go a couple months ago and be a good example to her. Turns out that I had 14 cavities and it will cost about $3,500 to fix them all.My parents never allowed fizzy drinks in the house and made us brush our teeth twice a day, now I'm 30 and I've never had a filling or anythingLol I just had this conversation with my friend like a week ago. I have a whole Bitcoin from back then and all the info is on an old computer in my attic. It's worth more now. I don't know how much but it'd be nice to cash out.I'm 33 and also hadn't been to the dentist in about 20 years until I went to a free cleaning thing at a dental school a few weeks ago. I had mild calculus or whatever that took them a few hours to clean off.\n\nI dunno if it's genes but I'm not a paragon of dental hygiene - just stay up on it with electric toothbrushes and keep floss picks handy; primarily haven't struggled with substance abuse/addiction and don't eat much processed sugar that I don't cook or bake myself.\n\nagain - idk if I just have good genes or am lucky; but in my opinion, not having any serious risk factors for dental hygiene and sorta caring seems like it was a much better plan than yearly visits\n\n\nbut also I'm American so I don't have health insurance and if it turns out I missed some kind of infection and have meningitis or something then I'd just fuckin' die on the side of the road so maybe don't listen to anything I have to sayI had dry sockets after having my wisdom teeth removed.\n\nYou ever had someone dare you to hold a lighter under your arm until you couldn't stand the pain and had to move your arm away?  It's like that, but in your mouth and you can't move it.Waiting is wayyyy more expensivePoverty charges interest...I literally just did this. Went in after a year. And it was... *drum roll*\n\nTotally fine! No root canal, nothing. Just a filling. Super easy, same day, an hour and a half and I was outta there.\n\nI know it's a chore, but maybe call a few dentists to see if they'll quote you?I let 2 cavities have their way with me when I was 24. By the time I was 27 all that was left of them were 2 angry shattered stumps. Then the abscess came. Someone told me the pain is equivalent to child birth and I believe it. And it doesn't stop, no matter how much listerine you use. I let that shit go for almost 4 years because I thought I couldn't afford it. I very well could have died and guess what? Medicaid paid for it. All of it. A root canal and extraction. I put myself through so much pain and could have died, and the whole time, it would have been free. I don't know what county you're in or what your insurance situation is, but if my \"bottom of the barrel\" US gov health insurance paid for my procedure, there is probably something similar available to you. Even if not- get that shit taken care of before it ruins your life.It doesn't. Unless you're in the USA, in which case... I'm sorry.[deleted]Worth it. Not like you pay it in 1 lump sum. Pay it off over the course of time your teeth are being fixed.Reminds me of this golden post: [No More Zero Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/1qbxvz/the_gospel_of_uryans01_helpful_advice_for_anyone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)This is what I'm being told by the people I trust, but you hit the nail on the head.

Life is a journey, and all we can do is our best :)Umm yes and no? Not in a condescending way but people can do and say very stupid things and I avoid the people who make that their personality.

I started feeling old at 25 and realized I potentially had 2-3 more full cycles of that. Life is too long, there's no benefit to freaking out and feeling old for 75 whole years.I have 30 more years? Sounds like I don't have to deal with this for another 29 years then phewJust had this conversation with my brother, who is ten years younger than me. He's 22.

No added sugar? How much did you do these things in your 20s?Totally agree but in defense of guidance counselors everywhere, there aren\u2019t many who could\u2019ve predicted the impact of the internet. Mine was easily in his 60s and he meant well but his age meant he likely wouldn\u2019t know the impact of technology.Problem with that is we are not guaranteed even one day of life. Many die the day they were born so planning at all with time in mind is a folly in itself. Build a better you as fast as you can. No age is too late as long as there is life left. I was this way until 38 in one year I got my IT professional certification, a new place and car and a girlfriend. It takes very little time to correct with the proper motivationSenior Software Engineer here, I would not start with Python.  I would start with C# or Java.  The biggest pitfall for beginners in Python is that its dynamically typed (a variable that is supposed to hold one kind of value, such as a boolean, actually holds a different kind of value, such as a number).  C# ( pronounced C-Sharp) and Java are staticly typed, widely used, and in high demand.  Before looking for a job/internship, you should also look into databases (Microsoft SQL (tSQL) and MySQL), source control such as GIT, and fronted tech stacks (HTML, CSS, Typescript, Angular, and React).  It may seam daunting, but its a great career path, and the community is generally very helpful.  There are a bunch of online resources, both paid and free, to help you along.  My recommendation is to start with codecademy.com.  It's a great site that helps you learn the basics through repetition.  \n\nAs for a job in the field, I would recommend either a paid internship, or working for a consulting company (where other companies contract them to do thier  tech work) as an actual full time employee (don't agree to be a contractor on a contract basis as a beginner, risk vs reward is just to high without a high skill level).  Benefits of an intership is no one expectes much of you, and it takes some pressure off.  Benefits of a consulting company is you get to work with multiple tech stacks in a relatively short time frame. \n\nIf you have further questions, I will be happy to answer them, though I will be busy most of the next few days, I will respond as soon as I am able.  \n\nAs a parting gift\n\nCourses:\nBasics of Javascript (frontend language.

It sounds like you\u2019re feeling legitimately upset by people holding your livelihood over your head while they abuse you (this is the standard for modern business attitude toward blue collar workers, but that\u2019s another story).\n\nPython is good choice for a first dip into programming since it is written kind of the way we speak. Python is mostly used for data science, and if you plan to pursue that field, it\u2019s an even better choice. I personally learned JavaScript and web development, now I\u2019m a Frontend Software Engineer using React framework. I got my first job in October and have recruiters messaging me all the time with positions starting at 160k and up.\n\nMy advice is join r/learnprogramming, look around and see how people talk about learning, join one of the free learning platforms (codecademy, freecodecamp, etc) and give it a shot. One thing they don\u2019t tell you is being a software engineer is mostly about managing your frustration. Things don\u2019t work the first 5x and then they do, and that\u2019s totally normal. Not getting pissed and quitting is the biggest hurdle.first just learn all of the basics to coding, then make something that you can use in your job applications(this will also cement the skills you learned and help you find out what else you need to learn),  add some documentation to explain what you made and even without a degree it should help a lot.\n\nalso feeling bad when people are mean to you isnt weakness, caring about your well being is a strength.no pressure thenDon't. Braces are awesome.\n\nI'm way past my 30's and would love to have braces. My teeth look like a grenade went off in my mouth.Could be worse: when I was in Boot Camp one of the drill instructors (probably late 20's early 30's) had braces and rubber bands. \n\nFact is, most people probably don't notice or care that you have braces. But everyone in the battalion knew he had braces, and it was a source of constant jokes for bored recruits, and even other drill instructors.I know, fucking realised this about a week ago.Exactly, 30+ and on an invisalign treatment, that smile is gonna look ccccclean once the masks comes off.I had to get my teeth pulled for dentures. I've never been so grateful for masks in my life.I used it to grow my hair out.  I got to go through the awkward middle lengths where it just looks like you haven't gone in for a haircut in a while (vs it being an intentional decision) in isolation.So lucky I started my long ass Invisalign treatment back in mid-2019. I\u2019m finally done just in time for spring and the lifting of mandates.Lucked out and got braces on about 3 months before the pandemic started.I had braces around then too & am now in the \u201clost my retainers a year later and now the gap in my teeth is becoming pronounced again\u201d camp myselfApparently that can also be a factor of the cure that used to be used, according to my dentist. He keeps trying to get me to get some teeth whitening service to get rid of the stains but I've stopped caring.Beyond paying for the service, taking you to all the appointments and nagging you to wear the rubber bands, floss, brush, etc\u2026.wtf else is parent supposed to do? Brush them for you? JFC. \n\nI say this as a frustrated parent to a now adult that has lost their retainer, has stained teeth and terrible dental habits.I was depressed too, and found even the most mundane tasks difficult to do. What I found effective though, was to tell myself \"it's easier than you think\". Whenever I was about to give up doing a task like brushing my teeth, I told myself that, and it usually got me motivated enough to start doing the task.There's more sensory input with brushing your teeth. The foaming, taste and scrubbing.. it feels like you're doing something. Flossing just reminds you of the gross shit between your teeth and when you start it begins with your mouth bleeding. That's why. Flossing has a bad PR team, same outfit that's in charge of colonoscopies.I like it when the dentist asks when I flossed last. I tell them they should have that in my file since they did it \ud83d\ude00\n\nI'm kidding, sort of.LPT: Keep a pack of dental picks at your home desk. Seriously, this changed my dental health. You're sitting there anyways, might as well clean your teethPeople tend to not enjoy flossing their teeth into a bloody mess. But that won't happen if you floss more often.The thing that got me flossing was a change in floss. I didn't like the string floss and the floss sticks were awkward. I did get a sample of a changeable head flosser with the floss perpendicular to the handle and it was easy to use so I picked up flossing. Also Radius has some paper with floss between that you hold onto the paper and that is nice for traveling. Examples: [https://www.amazon.com/Listerine-Ultraclean-Access-Flosser-Hygiene/dp/B00NK414YO](https://www.amazon.com/Listerine-Ultraclean-Access-Flosser-Hygiene/dp/B00NK414YO) or  [https://www.earthturns.com/radius-natural-silk-floss-sachets](https://www.earthturns.com/radius-natural-silk-floss-sachets)I started flossing daily like 2 years ago\n\nThe difference in how healthy my gums and teeth look is visible\n\nJust like exercising. It may take some time, and it may not be fun, but you will see a difference.if you\u2019re not trolling, then you should definitely cash it out. It\u2019s worth $42k right nowEeeh. I guess the nerve pain feels like a throbbing, ungulating, trashing electrical burn that localizes on the nerve, then slowly moves to each nearby tooth, then up to the upper jaw, down the spine, then up the side of the skull and around the eye socket.\n\nPain meds don't do anything, and the only way to deal with it is to dope yourself up with sleep aids, and sleep it off until the nerve burns itself out and it goes away for like a day or so.That assumes you'll eventually pay out.\n\nIf I can't afford it now, how will I afford it later when it costs even more?\n\nSolution for me seems that I'll never get my teeth nor gums fixed. I may drop dead from some infection shooting into my brain any day now, but hey, at least I won't be living in bankruptcy.\n\nHopefully I'll actually start making enough money one day to afford the dental care I need. That's the hope, anyway.Holy shit that was incredible. I've been working really hard to pull myself out of a bad mental state that I got into over many, many years, which COVID life finally threw in my face so hard that I couldn't keep ignoring it. I've been busting my ass to have what I now know to call non-zero days, and I realized yesterday in savasana that the best days are *always* the ones where I embrace these \"rules\" as fully as I can. I hadn't quite articulated the idea about the three yous, and I am so happy to have had that spelled out for me. It will help a ton with motivation, which I struggle with as someone with ADHD.\n\nAbsolutely amazing. Here's to all the small improvements, no matter how small, that help you be a better you.r/BestOfRedditI got on Reddit today intentionally looking for this answer. I didn\u2019t know where to look, so I just started aimlessly scrolling. No more zero days.i fixed my entirely negative outlook by first fully disproving the negative voices by making 100% true counter examples and then anytime i had a negative thought id bash it down with the positive thought and within a week my negative thoughts lost all their power and within a month they stopped appearing all together.\n\nafter that i eventually started shifting my perspective to notice the good/positive things which was a super fun experience since all i noticed was the bad/negative. almost everyday for a bit more than a year id have a new revelation that altered how i saw the world, slowly tweaking my perspective so that i could see the whole picture of pretty much everything i can think of. i still miss things occasionally which gives me opportunities to further improve my perspective. \n\neven that last sentence is an example of seeing the positive with the negative that i would have just used to shit on myself because i hadnt improved enough.\n\nby seeing the positive my daily quality of life went from a 2-3/10 to a 5-7/10, the 5s are when i get depressed(which now dull me out instead of that great feeling of being crushed by an abyss of despair) and im still relearning to be happy and about a year ago i even regained optimism which was something i had completely forgotten about.\n\nbasically what im saying is it's just a bunch of tiny steps and you wont even recognize yourself a year from now after enough perspective shifts.Share that wisdom. There are more lost boys now than ever beforeOne doesn't need to time travel. Anytime you decide to unfuck your life is a plus.oh my god. you just fixed my life.Knowing less seems to be the secret to happiness\n\nI have deleted all my socials, and stopped watching the news. I feel my overall mood and outlook on life has improved slightly, but I still learn too much from being on reddit. If I can kick my addiction to this site I'd be the happiest idiot in the world.That was my first thought.. really seems like most of the posters just need a hugSimilarly, /r/PepTalksWithPopsr/DadForAMinute too. I've seen everything from questions about fixing stuff to just needing to vent.!remind me 10 yearsAwwww that is so wholesome[removed]My last couple of loops definitely took me down lol[deleted]Upward falling.   I like it.It takes time, so be gentle in how you speak to yourself.\n\nI graduated university in 2008 - arguably not the *best* time to finish school lol\n\nI got stuck doing retail jobs until the economy recovered, at which point my degree had become stale and I no longer was competitive at all.\n\nI was pretty unhappy, making shit money, and couldn't get any respect from anyone. Basically I was (and felt like) I was at the bottom rung of the ladder.\n\nI snapped to attention somehow and swore I'd work slowly to turn my life around. I applied to grad school twice and was rejected. So I decided to move back to my University town and hustled my way into grad school by meeting and befriending any engineering professor I could. Remember, I'm just a dude and in no way affiliated with the school anymore, but I showed each professor I met that I would be deadly serious in school and they'd own my time.\n\nI was admitted eventually and worked around the clock for a professor. He got me tuition assistance, and I ultimately graduated with the masters degree I wanted and with no debt. Now I'm way overpaid and practice civil engineering as a professional.\n\nPoint of all this is: I had nothing and it's taken me nearly 10 years to get where I wanted to be. LOTS of sacrifices to make along the way (leaving my home to go to a far remote state where I could be a bigger fish in a smaller pond).\n\nAs much as life is not fair, it's still up to US to make the changes we need to better our life. It's so hard and often goals seem so far away that we'll never get there. But every day is a chance to make a small incremental change in the right direction!Yeah \u201cjust begin again\u201d is a powerful idea.\n\nWhile \u201cyou ain\u2019t no fucking bum, dawg.\u201d carries positive intentions and good will from the person saying that\u2026..I just find in myself (as I age) that how we are articulate things matters. So while those words may offer solace in that moment, do they carry an understanding in your life in this world that can maintain that momentum? Maybe they can, hopefully they can.\n\nEveryone\u2019s different.At least you have a hairline.Recently got on minoxidil and finasteride. Shit is super cheap nowadays and I'm just magically getting my hairline back. Worth a shot!Mine was screaming from the grave when I was 20.[deleted][deleted]\"Honey?\"\n\n\"Hm?\", he looked up from his laptop. \n\n\"You're doing it again.\", she said.\n\n\"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Clenching your jaw. What are you reading?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing. Finish your can of beans.\"Did your home cost $8000?First off, congrats for being where you are, I\u2019m sure that took a lot of work and you should be proud.\n\nBUT\u2026\n\nYou are ignoring many benefits that came with the life you chose that other people won\u2019t get.  Military (and no not EVERYONE can do that) affords you:\n\n1.  No down payment mortgage (this would have taken you YEARS depending on COL area and your pay)\n2.  Military payment in perpetuity?  Depending on the terms of how you got out, you might be negating this benefit.\n3.  No living cost for those 8 years of your life other than car insurance/cell?\n4.  Medical covered for those 8 years.\n\nYou are VASTLY undervaluing the launchpad you had while in the military.This is so ignorant. Motivation and hard work alone don't get people what they want, there is ALWAYS an element of luck. Every time I've managed to make improvements something new happens. Family members dying at perfect intervals to set me back, being assaulted, some asshole running into the side of my house with his car right after someone hit my vehicle and fought my insurance, went back to school and covid hit making me have to drop and work again, blood clot at 25, ensuing health issues that arent resolved after years, and a preexisting disability. I'm utterly tired of people like you acting like everyone gets enough of a break from this shit to haul their ass over the poverty line. You worked hard, sure, but you were also fortunate. Survivor bias is wild.This feels like absolute lies and bullshit\n\nClearly you also missed the \u201chealth issues\u201d, and you had the financial help of joining a violent oppressive organizationSounds like you cut out toxic influences and a lot of the \u201crebuilding it right\u201d stage of things is still ahead for you.That makes perfect sense! The depressed part doesn't sound great though.. I hope you find some more good people with a more differntiated personality and healthy relationships that come with itRight, I\u2019m tired of being here\u2026Plus there is a potential to be more productive as over half of your first 25yrs were used for elementary school.Well that perspective helped me to stop feeling that way, hopefully it can help you tooI\u2019m 22 and feel that way lol.Hey, optimismWow you have really overgauged that. Youll be riddled with dementia or alzheimers long before then. If youre a man prostate cancer will take you long before 300 years..You and me both.Exercise helps A LOT. You won't really see the effects of sitting on your ass all day until random shit starts breaking down.I feel like we are saying the exact same thing.\n\nAnd yeah, of course improvising is key part of strategizing along with planning.\n\nPlanning-only is an oversight caused by the illusion of godlike-control which is a product of ignorance.\n\nOne has to learn how to swim in shipwrecks. Be like water my friend.I disagree with this statement about Python. It\u2019s true that many highly developed applications will be in compiled and/or statically typed languages, and that arguably those languages provide the best tools for writing really robust production code.\n\nBut the reason I disagree is that for a true beginner, accessibility is the most important factor. It doesn\u2019t matter how robust your toolset is if you never actually learn it because it\u2019s too intimidating. I love Python because it\u2019s basically like speaking English to a computer, which makes it easier to immediately start building things and getting rewarded for your efforts, which will make you feel rewarded and more likely to stick with the project long enough to gain a foothold.Same here. Can\u2019t afford it tho. My teeth are my biggest insecurity and I rarely smile so not to show my teeth.Recoome?Hey man at least you can call yourself tazer face... Or something cool like thatI don't think \"people will constantly make fun of you behind your back\" was the comforting anecdote you meant to tellbraces are fucking awful.  I remember it hurting to eat everythingThe start of the pandemic was when people were still optimistic enough to believe everyone would follow the isolation advice and the whole thing would be over in a month.[deleted]My girlfriend did invisalign after years of not wearing a retainer fixed her up in about 7 months. Her twin sister did one of the cheaper versions and that too worked altho she commented that some of the trays were sharp and the plastic felt cheap compared to the invisalign.I'd encourage you to go and see someone sooner rather than later, if you want to get it fixed.\n\nI had braces about 15-16 years ago, and my ortho didn't give me any sort of retainer beyond the first year after getting braces off. Now my teeth have moved back and the crossbite is damaging my teeth. I'm staring down the barrel of having braces in my mid 30s for another 2 years to correct it. Or Invisalign. At $9k AUD.\n\nIf you want to fix it, fix it sooner rather than later.Nagging never helped me to do anything in my life and only builds resentment. \n\nI had a major hand/wrist injury when I was around 12 and I could never remember to do my rehab exercises on my own. My mother would remember about once a week and come down hard on me with \"you need to start doing those\" and other nagging statements but she never did anything to set me up for success with it, just created guilt and resentment because I couldn't remember. Now I can't close my hand all the way because of scar tissue that built up.\n\nShe absolutely should have \"done it for me\" by building in a routine to my evening, sitting me down and counting my reps for me, etc. Even just one time of showing me what that should look like would have gone a long way. Up until that point in my life I had never even done an exercise with any regularity.\n\nIt's a parent's responsibility to teach their kids life skills like how to create and maintain good habits. Nagging does not do that.Teaching your kid the importance of brushing teeth isn't a parental duty? It's not just every once in a while \"HEY GO BRUSH YOUR DAMN TEETH\" it's so much more than that, and your child's fucked up teeth are indeed your fault. But hey, nobody's perfect. As long as you did better than your parents, that's good enough.My problem wasn\u2019t necessarily a lack of motivation, I just did not care. At all.  In fact, it was almost like a form of self-harm for me. \u201cNothing matters, I hate myself, everyone else thinks I\u2019m a failure already - so why even bother?  I hope my teeth just fall out, it\u2019s what I deserve anyway for being such a piece of shit.\u201d  \n\nAdd in chewing tobacco like a fiend on top of it, and I\u2019m absolutely terrified to go to a dentist because of the shame and lecture I\u2019ll have to endure. \n\nAnd this was during one of the most successful times in my life. Like - wildly successful. Great family and awesome career that I\u2019m really good at.  Depression is a motherfucker.  \n\nI\u2019m still nowhere near out of it, but I brushed my teeth last night, and I\u2019m treating it like I just conquered Sparta.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s nice to see I\u2019m not the only one who suffered with that symptom of depression. I honestly thought it was just me and that I was just a massive piece of shit because of it.[deleted]The foaming actually does nothing too lol, it's added so it does feel like you're doing more. \n\nIn reality, you're not doing any extra cleaning in places you're not actually brushing, and the thing they add to make it foamy (sodium laureth sulfate IIRC) is actually what makes certain shit taste absolutely vile after brushing your teeth. You can buy toothpaste that doesn't have it, doesn't foam, and doesn't make stuff taste nasty. Still cleans your teeth the same. \n\nMaybe someday I'll make a pleasently foaming floss and be completely transparent about the fact that it's a gimmick and does nothing extra, but the whole shtick is that flossing is so important that I went to the trouble of making a foaming floss and getting it into stores, just to catch people's attention and them flossing, so if flossing is that important, you should probably buy some floss - and hey, if you're gonna buy some floss anyways, mine is competitively priced... \n\nPlus it foams!!Flossing before your dental appointment is the adult equivalent to cramming for an exam. Your dentist knows just like your professor didI have them in my shower! Guarantees I'll floss at least once daily.This is my move as well!  I've already got an oral fixation might as well do something productive with it instead of ruining all my pencilsTook me like 2 weeks to stop bleeding. Now I floss 2-3 times a dayHuh, that's nifty. Only thing with those floss holder types is you have to rinse the floss after every tooth. Otherwise you're spreading that junk and bacteria from tooth to tooth.Yep. $42k is way better than a bitcoin, but it depends on how much they care about the money. If you can afford it, ride it out and see where it goes I guess.God that explains a pain I get every so often. It was suuuuper bad one time which led me to urgent care and they gave me a shot of morphine.I'd also like to add how important seeking professional help is also. Most people wouldn't try to mend a broken bone on their own. This is a great way to work on your own personal view points and change your perception of yourself and the world around you. But sometimes we need medical intervention.If you improve your behavior by .1% daily for a year, you improve by 36.5% in a year!This is essentially a part of cognitive behavioral therapy. There's a book called Feeling Good by David D. Burns that goes over it pretty well>first fully disproving the negative voices by making 100% true counter examples\n\nwhat counter examples do you mean? Like exercising or doing something helpful?I've got the same problem. I've quit Reddit before and I can do it again. The trick is to find something to do when I have nothing to do.Lost my dad to COVID almost 2 years ago\u2026 I subbed and teared up a bit.Just joined three new subsI am not training for a slam dunk competition. I have not been a power lifter.\n\nWhy are my knees and back hurting?Ehh. I found a nice spot to lay down when I was like 25 and just thought \"Fuck it\". I don't want to come off as arrogant but the longer it goes on, the more wise I feel for that.\n\nSure would have been nice to be able to afford a mortgage anywhere in my own city, though, I'll say that.Then make some tweaks in this third loop.  One tiny change each day can mean an entirely new life by next year.Plan, Do, Check, Accept defeat.Thanks, I needed this. Currently in a PhD program after failing to graduate college the first time around. Now if only I could un-fuck-up my love life.I've still got a line. It's just further back and and the ranks are kind of thin... as if they are wavering peasant conscripts facing a battle hardened barbarian horde.[deleted]Man, only on Reddit will you find people calling a gas station worker privileged.  If someone isn\u2019t literally homeless you guys will \u201cYeah, buuttt\u2026.\u201dIt works and to be fair my depression is clinically diagnosed so it\u2019s not going anywhere just some days are better than others \u263a\ufe0f26 and agreed but I\u2019m optimisticLol don't take it seriously, he's quoting a line from a movie. Ricky Bobby from Talladega Nights.If there is a university near you they might have a dental program & they often have clinics that are low cost for dental work.  My friend did this & it really helped her.Start laughing a lot. No joke like laughing at stuff by yourself and practice opening your mouth while you do it. Then or acting in front of a mirror. Not a smile but laughter. You\u2019re gonna look and sound crazy if someone catches you so be worried.\n\nI had the worst teeth growing up and all through hs I didn\u2019t smile in pictures. It wasn\u2019t till I noticed I never smiled in pictures with my friends even though I remember it being a good time. So I started laughing during pictures. My buddy  originally told me to try and it took a while but I started to smile once in awhile :)Hit Recoome's music!RecooooooomeI don't think anything about boot camp ever was or ever will be comforting.I had perpetual canker sores lining my bottom lip with my bottom braces.Damn, I was wanting to try those cheaper ones. I had invisalign and went through like 3 of their retainers in a year, they would just dissolve into nothing.\n\nEach visit would increase the amount I needed to pay (for some reason they had to keep making new moulds and not just use the same as before) so not only was I spending heaps to maintain this shitty plastic things, every time they were lesser and lesser effective because during the time it takes to bring myself to the dentist and get new ones my teeth would move enough to make the new mould slightly more crooked. \n\n\nEventually my wallet gave out and I just stopped using them and although my teeth are far from as bad as they were before, they're still not the perfect straight I got so many comments about, so back to hiding my smile.\n\n\n3/10 would just go for the old school retainers.Omg I\u2019ve been thinking about Invisalign so this is great to know!!! Ty!!Yes! I totally think it was more your parents job then yours. A child can\u2019t grasp the long term repercussions of things and to many parents give them selfs the benifit of the doubt like \u201coh I tired I told them\u201d that\u2019s not trying. I had braces for four years cause my mom just stopped taking me to get them tightened or taken off. At the time I was just like what ever but it\u2019s come to bite me hard and still blame her.Man, I get it. My mom took me to all the lead up appointments for braces then backed out saying I didn't brush my teeth. I did. I didn't floss though, cause it was a pain. The floss would shred and tear and get stuck between my teeth and it was 5 minutes minimum to get it out. Why did this happen? Cause my teeth were (still are) crowded as fuck. Whenever I asked about braces I got the same thing, how I don't care for my teeth. When I brought up getting a waterpik, THAT THE DENTIST SUGGESTED, I was told no, they don't do a good job, real floss is better. You need to brush better. What? Brush better? YOU TAUGHT ME! Years of being told \"You don't brush.\" when in fact I did twice a day. Still resentful about it 20 years later, but I have a waterpik now, and all my teeth survived high school, so there's that.No, I did that. And as adult\u2026they have carelessly undone any efforts and money I put into it.I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one that lets brushing my teeth/ washing my face fall by the wayside when I\u2019m down. Feeling like you\u2019ve conquered Sparta when you do it once is such an accurate statement.I went to the dentist after skipping for a good 7 years. Had to get some serious work done on my gums, I had periodontitis that had gone unchecked for at least a year or two.\n\nI didn't experience a word of lecturing or shaming, though I was expecting at least a bit. Don't let that fear stop you from taking care of your teeth - they were mostly just happy that I came in and earnest about explaining the state of my dental health and what needed to be done to make it better. I think most dentists will be the same way, and if they aren't, you can try to find another and not return to the shitty one that makes you feel bad for trying to fix a problem.As someone who smoked cigarettes and weed and drank alcohol until my teeth were beginning to rot and turn yellowand I had brown on the backside of them, don\u2019t let the fear of the dentists judgement turn you away. I was terrified of how they would perceive me and the dental hygienist said \u201cwell, at least you\u2019re getting it taken care of now\u201d and I felt so much better. After having multiple cavities filled, 3 teeth pulled and two bridges put in, I\u2019m not afraid to smile or bare my teeth anymore and even though I\u2019m a bit in debt, you can\u2019t put a price on your own self-esteem. I was in this boat a few months ago- afraid to go to the dentist for fear of shame and a lecture. But in December I finally went. The dentist didn't lecture me but did tell me what I need to do now to keep my teeth and gums healthy. I had to have some work done but nothing bad. Just some deep cleaning sessions and a filling. My teeth and gums still need to be monitored but I'm in a lot better shape. \n I recommend seeing the dentist. From the impression I had from my mine... my case (which was basically neglecting to have proper dental hygiene) wasn't anything unique.Hey, for what it's worth I was recently (less than a year ago) in the same place; multiple black cavities, two infections left to fester for several years untreated, one rotten tooth broken off under the gumline and leaking pus.\n\n I finally worked up the nerve to see a dentist and they were absolutely understanding and not once did I feel judged or lectured at all. Finally ended up with a root canal, an extraction, a few fillings, and a scaling+root planing to treat gum disease. Now my mouth is looking and feeling better than it has in probably a decade.\n\nIt's still not perfect and will never be at this point, but I can tell you from experience it wasn't anywhere close to as bad as I thought it would be; I damn near offed myself out of anxiety leading up to it, but I stuck through it and felt like I conquered a frickin mountain. You'll feel a hundred times better and be way more motivated to maintain good oral hygiene once it's done, I can't encourage it enough. Any pain and inconvenience is worth the relief of knowing it's taken care of.\n\nBest of luck to you!That's pretty similar to how I felt, except my depression wasn't the self loathing type. I felt more like the world lost its luster and life felt pointless. So my thoughts were more like \"everything sucks anyway so why would I care if people think my teeth look good\". Then the pain set in and I remembered it's not all about looking good lol.\n\nBut I'm glad you're proud of yourself for brushing. That's a great first step, and hopefully it motivates you to do more!I didn't go to the dentist for 12 years because I couldn't afford it.  I straight up told the dentist office I didn't want no lecture about taking care of my teeth when it's not covered under health insurance so I literally just couldn't get cavities filled.Glad im not the only with the depression bad oral combo.So agreed. Therapy and medication have been life changing and I wouldn't have had the tools to even conceptualize of non-zero days without professional help. It's always worth it to seek counseling, no matter how small you think your issues are.lol this book has been on my desk for 4 months now, i almost read it one time when the power went out but it came back on right as i opened it up.\n\ni guess i'll read it now >.>the first step is identifying what your negative thoughts are and then disproving them because in my experience there exists a positive thought that mirrors the negative one and it just depends on which side you want to be on. i didnt mention any of them at first because it really borders on the edge of therapy and i dont want to mislead anyone when they should be going through the process with a professional. \n\nnegative thoughts make us feel bad and/or prevent us from doing things, for the feeling bad stuff it could be that you are going through the day then you do or say something that triggers your internal voice and you think something mean about yourself as a kind of self bullying. a counter example would be a positive truth that is in the same vein as the negative one.\n\nagain, for specifics you should really ask a professional. i only have my own experience navigating this stuff so i dont want to provide specific examples since it needs to be true for you.We're just fuckin old : /I'm in my mid thirties and everyday my body sounds like rice krispies when I roll out of bed, hands that cramp from arthritis, and knees that randomly go out. I worked out in my 20s heavy, why is my body betraying me, this shit sucksI suppose I kind of hit a spot where I'm like \"If I'm not enjoying life, then what's the point in living?\"\n\nAll these people who have had mediocrity work for them constantly try to gaslight you into thinking that's the only way to live, and it's just kinda like... fuck that?\n\nNot to imply that you're doing that or anything, I'm just venting at the general attitude of broader society.Once you cast off all the expectations of family/friends and regret of missed opportunities you are free. Do what YOU want with your live and don\u00b4  t let others dictate at what pace you\u00b4 re supposed to be going.\n\nI\u00b4 ve been doing that for the last 15 years and it works for me. As long as your lifestyle doesn\u00b4  t hurt anyone, go for it.I like your positive attitude \ud83d\udc4dIm with you bro. I am thinking about shaving it all, but it's an emotional hurdle.lmaoY'all need to give yoga, or at least some easy stretching routines, a go.\n\nFind some quiet spot you can hide from civilization and just try it. My wife got me doing it, I hated it, but it did start to improve my joints/flexibility. But god-damn, I'm not ready to admit it yet. Plus she wore some yogi pants. =)believing that depression is there forever makes it there forever, we have way more power over our minds than we think. at the very least we can definitely reduce it's power to the minimum. at its core depression is a defence mechanism because we were overwhelmed by certain negative emotions, for me it was sadness. im currently trying to acknowledge my depression and to move on with my life, it feels like slowly loosening a valve that has been holding my sadness in for 20 years and ive started feeling bits of sadness again, though at the time i didnt realize it was sadness and just knew it as the feeling where i wanted to curl up into a ball and forget i exist. after understanding it was sadness ive been able to process it and let the emotion go. the frequency of my depressive episodes has decreased by a bunch and when they occur i barely notice them instead of the all consuming life pausing for months feelings that they were before.The only problem with this is the wait. In some areas the clinics are so backed up you might not be able to get an appointment with them for months.Cant make fun of insecurities you no longer have.\n\nSeriously, own that shit. Due to mental issues  I was always quiet cos I was always afraid of saying or doing something silly or stupid.  This went on long enough for me to no longer gave close friends.\n\nNow me, my now close fiends, and my coworkers expect and find joy in the sometimes silly and stupid things I say or do.\n\nI don't say them as often as I thought I would, but I own them when it happens.\n\nProudly be the weird kid.  Everybody wishes they were brave enough to be their own brand of weird.I was told something that I still remember to this day- many years laters. \u201cNo matter what happens, the day is going to come to an end and the sun is going to rise again.\u201d  Not an exact quote- but it seriously has helped me get through some hard days that I thought would never end.I don\u2019t know man, I got pretty comfortable with an MRE and the ugly chick from 2nd platoon onceHoly crap this is the second person I've ever met who knows that canker sores exist. I don't even have braces and I get them all the time.It\u2019s probably because of all the blood in the sink. \n\n(Sorry - if we can\u2019t a make a little fun at ourselves, what\u2019s the point?)Gotta keep working out manI can offer you no assistance, but if it helps, all those snap crackle and pops have a name.\n\nYou have crepitus. It's usually not a problemI started shaving it about 7 years ago. Haven't looked back.I've been shaving a few years. I absolutely love it. Even if I had perfect hair again I'd probably just keep shaving. I never had any compliments on my hair when I had it, but multiple people have complimented my bald appearance so that's cool. Though I did get sunburn on my head recently, so be careful there.Months is better than never in your 40's.As someone who waited til 36 to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed and my dental health unfucked, its worth the short few monthsI love this. Insecurities still struggled with daily. Wish I only had the one lmao. I\u2019m kinda the same, quiet kid who didn\u2019t talk much. Till I met some people who like talking to me lol. Then I met more and more and liked who I was. I spilled over a bit a few years ago and started saying too much and not meaning what I said a lot. Didn\u2019t really vibe with that so I changed. \n\n\nI\u2019m only in my 20s but I carry a big heart on my sleeves and I\u2019ve always been weird asf. You\u2019re right and I wish more people spoke out for themselves. \nWhen I just accepted I\u2019m who I am and that people won\u2019t like that but some love it, I stopped caring so much about making everyone happy and trying to be friends with everyone. \n\nJust here to find some people to I relate to more. Make my close friends closer and meat as many weird wild people as I can is one of my life goals too. \nKeep being kind. You\u2019re a good person. Hope you have a great rest of your day :)Que apocalypse jokeHow did you swing that?Lmao. Lots of blood.Putting a toothbrush against your gums for the first time in 12 days and seeing your sink suddenly turn into a sea of blood is always such a mindfuck and only makes me anxious on top of depressed lmao\n\nNow whenever I do happen to be going through it particularly bad, I just tell myself to use some mouthwash for a minute at the very least.LmfaoThanks man I hope your day is scrum diddlydumtious as wellGrabbed my MRE during chow time and met ugly chick in a port-a-John while we were at the range, battle buddies covered for us and I ate in the port-a-John while ugly chick sucked me off.

    "Comments": "Once my socks are off there is no putting them back on my feet until they've come out of the dryer.Dirty I'm not too opposed to.  Wet/sweaty just forget it.I was a mechanic for the CHEAPEST owner of a forklift repair business. He would only pay for a uniform change \u201cevery other day\u201d. Let me tell you, it was truly miserable putting on that black, greasy uniform every other day.I was doing a jungle survival course as part of my country's military officer training. We had 2 sets of uniform over this 10 day mission (one on us, one in bag) with 3 days of food rations. The Forrest was dense af and legit rained all day everyday (Course gets booked during monsoon season to make it harder) and I remember struggling hard with my team to:\n1. Start a fire with wet wood  ( we had to keep the dried wood from night 1 to use on night 2 to dry out other wood)\n2. Warm food up when its raining\n3. Having to change back into the dirty set of clothes in the morning, after morning dew (clean set was used to sleep in - felt so good). Imagine, its raining, its cold, you've been wearing this set of mud ridden clothes and haven't showered in days.What are you talking about? There\u2019s nothing better than sliding into a nice pair of warm soaking wet denim pants.No. If you leave dirty clothes on the floor for 3 or more days, they clean themselves.I hate trying to put a wet swimsuit back on, it\u2019s so shit!Kind of like the way the thought of your own saliva becomes disgusting the moment it leaves your mouth.I once got off the plane and was sent to a hotel for the night by the airport whilst waiting for my next flight the next day without my suitcase on me and I went to bed in the same clothes I was wearing during the flight, I then woke up and took a shower (completely forgetting I didn't have any spare clothes or anything else for that matter) so I dried myself and put on the same fucking clothes once again for my next flight. I felt disgusting.Hey, that\u2019s my cleanest dirty shirtIt depends how quickly the clothes became dirty. The more sudden the dirt acquisition the less tolerable it is.Unless they're jeans.Do you know me personally? No? Then don't attack me like that!I think it\u2019s more about the moisture than anything else.  Putting on dirty clothes that are dry really isn\u2019t an issue for me.I think it\u2019s a bit revealing of your laundry habits that this was your shower thought.When I went to basic in 2012 we had 5 uniforms to wear. Of course in the military you are told what to do, when to do it, how to do it. \n\nThere were laundry machines in our bay but no one was told we could use them, so we never did. \n\nAbout 2 weeks in our drills finally asked why the fuck we stink so much. \n\nWe were re using all our uniforms, including underwear and socks. \n\nFinally we got the \"you fucking idiots we have laundry right there, fucking use it. This is why none of you will ever be loved by any woman but your momma\"As someone whose bathroom and laundry room is being renovated right now, I can attest to this.God, waking up after a week on a field Op and putting on those dirty crusty commies was the WORST.Depends, are they floor clothes or other dirty clothes? Because the floor clothes aren\u2019t too badNothing worse then getting a rare shower in the field only to have to put on filthy clothes again.Swallowing your spit is less unbearable than spitting it out and drinking it againHaving your spit in your mouth is much more bearable than putting your spit back in your mouthYes and no. Sleeping in used clothes and wearing them the next day is worse that taking them off and putting them on again in the morning.A healthy helping of depression will change that in an instant.I put on dirty clothes every morning.  I'm retired and walk every morning so it makes no sense to wear clean clothes, sweat in them then change them.  \n\nI put on clean clothes after I shower.\"Do you hate putting on dirty cloths? The unbearable feeling of filth against you skin in the morning? Well no more! Get your self Crippling Depression\u2122 today and re-wearing week old cloths will become an everyday habit!\"Poop is fine when it's inside me, but once it's out I sure as shit wouldn't put it back in.The less you clean your clothes the longer they last... washing machines are awful for our clothes. Gotta get my moneys worth and only wash my jeans once a month....\n\n\nJoking....\n\n\n\n\nNot.I got lucky this morning and found a dirty work shirt in the bottom of the hamper that really didn't stink.Is it? I will often chuck on the same pants as the day before if I'm not going anywhereHaving spit in your mouth is fine, but spitting into a cup and then drinking it would be disgusting.\"keeping dirty clothes on\" imply you are dirty with your clothes\n\n\"Putting dirty clothes on\" imply you are clean, or at least cleaner than your dirty clotheswow the comments here are absolutely bonkers... it is not a post traumatic causing event to put on \"once worn clothes\" ... you people would never survive without your creature comfortsI was just thinking this today when I decided not to take my socks off in between two work meetings out in the community (don't worry I wear a mask).Worst part about being in the military.Putting on wet cold socks or underwear should probably be considered mild torture.Same goes for wet clothes. Getting wet in your clothes sucks, but putting wet clothes on feels like jumping into a river in November.that's why I sleep clothedThey need sunshine & lieth.That's why I never take my clothes off.It's almost as bad as sucking spit back up.100% correct.  Imagine, being homeless, or even now in most cities, laundymats were closed due to Covid.  There was a period of two months we're there was literally two options to wash your clothes:\n\nGo to your parents/friend's house that had a washer and dryer\n\nGo to the ONE laundry mate in town where everyone else is and wait for hours for \"your turn\".that stale, cold, body sweat that you didnt even realize was there before. and how it just droops with a sad weightYou\u2019re already dirty when you have the dirty clothes on. While when clean putting on dirty clothes it sucks more because you have to re dirty yourself again with your old clothes.Unless your lazy like me and like dirty clothes\n\n\n\nEdit I do my laundry every week so chill :)Yah yahI've noticed that. How come?The same can be applied to human flesh.You gotta get used to the stink again. Then you're good to go.As a Mechanic I live this struggle everyday..\nI can be absolutely filthy and sweaty but comfortable because it's how I spend minimum 9 hours a day or more if I'm working on my own projects after work.Yeah that's why I go 3 to 4 days without changing, just sleep in my clothes as well... I have that aura of stink around me like in the sims....NiceThe same thing applies to wet clothesThis is so true lolNot for men with no dignity \ud83d\ude0eThat is so true yet weird*post shower thoughtsYep. They should  make it a torture  game in a Saw movieSame with a wet swimsuitAnd you just reminded me that I gotta turn over my laundry. Thank youOh hell yeah. Same thing with flipping dirty underwear inside out and rewearing cu you havent dome laundry.Only If they are caked in mud or if they are wetVery true. Same with wet clothes...That's because one makes you dirtier than before, the other doesn't as muchI'm a moderately lazy person who still has some sense and reasoning and I completely agree with this statement.Pants are the most bearable.Putting liefeld on the same night.Just gotta sniff it first and if it don't stank I'm cool with itAmericans literally use ketchup on their eggs too.If I didnt sweat during the day. Are the clothes dirty?  Always change boxers but I mean shorts?  A shirt?\n\nWe have literally zero things to do at work and my work shirt still smells like fabric softener like it did on the monday when its friday.*reads this as I'm wearing the same pair of pants for 3 days straight*He is speaking the language of the gods.I mean what\u2019s considered dirty? Cuz I\u2019ll wear the same jeans or pants/shorts at least 2 times before I switch. Shirts and underwear are usually a one use thing though. Socks I\u2019m okay putting on a second time depending on how long I wore them and in what conditionsYeah you said it. Nothing worse after the shit, shower, shave to find out the wardrobe is bare. I will only ever commando rather than wear dirty underwear. Bit when I am sick or just totally chillaxing I can atay in the same clothes for a5 least a couple of daysQuarantine revelationsOnce something is hamper dirty aka not chair dirty, the thought of putting it back on ... nope. Unless I literally have no other clothes that shit is staying off my body. Especially socks. I will not reuse socks. Gross.If it doesn\u2019t stink, WE\u2019RE GOOD :DMy girlfriend doesn\u2019t think so, in fact she says I\u2019m the only one that feels this way and now I\u2019m about to show her 11k upvotes lolTbh if i only wore it in the house and slept and stuff all day i wouldn't mind that much. I do it cause the clothes that are clean are to hotMaybe I'm just a depressed fuck but unless the clothes are *filthy* I'm generally happy to have clothes that fit.\n\nLike, I aim to wear a clean set of clothes every two days because that helps my mental health and shit. But I have, and will probably do so again during the next apathetic bout, worn the same set of clothes fot a week straight.Its easy to put them back on. If you pretend you washed it in 3 secondsThat\u2019s deep\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udebfAnd if you can\u2019t get a shower, just change your undies and wash your feet and face.Oh yeah, definitely. Once the underwear comes off, it ain't going back on.Talk about shower thoughtsNo it's not. They stay on on they're getting washed. Ugh.When you accidentally put on dirty underwear and they are all stretched out. UghHello from my ~~three month~~ three year and nine month depression.Unless your depressed?Depends I think.\n\nNeed to bring out some trash and need some long pants and only the ones with some small spots are left - big okay.\n\nGoing out with friends or supermarket - big no no.\n\nChilling at home - who tf should care or judge?Really? As long as they\u2019re not wet or covered in something gross I\u2019m fine with wearing themThat's why it's better to just not wear clothes, especially if you're gonna be homeJust hiked 544 miles of the Appalachian Trail and stopped yesterday.  Putting on stinky wet socks for a 4th day in a row is the worst. I concur, stinky clothes are no fun but wet, stinky socks, day after day, are so much worse. Just sayin\u2019. \ntbf - it\u2019s all bad. Just my perspective on the worst.BarbaricPreeeeeachThey're wet mom...Crusty ass sock. How you even get like this?Do you wash jeans after every wear?Mostly because you are dirtier than the clothes themselves.ThisIts an interesting metaphors for remaining in bad circumstances and habits versus reverting/returning to them. Apathy and laziness keep someone from pursuing something better but its often far harder to get them to return to those. Or maybe its just about you keeping your crusty ass socks on, you decide.same with wet clothesSpeak for yourselfWearing dirty underwear  is so much more unbearable than keeping itI call that \"mental inertia\".  What ever you're doing is easier to keep doing than to change even if the outcome is equally as bad either way (or good).You swallow your spit all day long, but imagine being asked to let your drool fill up a cup and then take a drink of it.same with wet clothesIf you just took a shower why would you put your dirty clothes back on?Not if you shit in the clothes you currently have on and not in the \"dirty\" clothes.This was honestly one of the worst things about doing field ops in the military. Waking up and putting on your filthy smelly disgusting uniform because you only have 3 of them and it's been a month since you've seen a washing machine.All 52 of them are so cute \ud83d\ude2dI work as an actor in a play in which we have a lot of change of costumes. The play is very intense physically and we sweat a lot, and by almost the end there\u2019s a scene where we take off all our clothes, which are very sweaty at that point, and then we have to put it back for the next scene. I can relate so much, and when is wet is even harder and disgusting, but I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything lolI think about this all the time.I worked in food service before and cooked fried chicken. I had five sets of uniforms and would only wear each one once day because it was awful to put on the greasy and smelling of fried food clothes. Some people would wear a uniform for three of four days. No matter what I tried to do I could never really get the smell fully out of the clothes when I washed them. I tried all kinds of stuff.You put on clothes?!?!?a truly showerthought in all its glorySame thing with wet clothesNah. Dirty clothes are legit. Dirty underwear sucks.I'll wear the same pair of jeans like 5 days straight.Its because the fresh dirty is better than old dirty.Y\u2019all have clothes? I\u2019d deduct them.Wow didn\u2019t know people were afraid of dirtThis is kind of like how there\u2019s spit in your mouth all the time, but if you spat on a clean plate the thought of licking it back up is completely repulsive.  It\u2019s literally the same stuff that\u2019s in your mouth, but as soon as it leaves your body your mind starts thinking of it as something from out there and that\u2019s gross.Shitting your pants is nowhere near as bad as shitting into your pants.If you want proof, join the ArmyJust microwave them first to warm them up.Change to sweaty and it is much worseThis is true for toxic relationships too.I helped my housemates brother move last summer. My knee was bothering me so I was wearing a knee brace, but I took it off while I sat down to eat. It had gotten so fucking sweaty, it felt like I was putting a wet bathing suit back on.Isn\u2019t this a post shower thoughtYes! Like when you\u2019re at a friends house taking a shower and have no clean clothes so you have to wear the clothes you wore before the shower. S\u2019nastyAnytime I take a shower and think \"Oh my clothes are still clean, I'll just put them back on\" and after I get them on I can't stand it and have to get clean clothes.You have spit in your mouth right now. It's fine. Spit some spit into a cup, wait a few minutes, then put that same spit back into your mouth where it came from.UNLESS you get off on that sort of thing.Not if the ones on you are soaked.  Had to drop muddy trou yesterday during a break from  digging ditches and boy did those filthy dry Dickies feel good.Same reason swallowing spit in your mouth is fine but if you spit it into a spoon it's all of a sudden disgustingEating food you already chewed and spit out is so much more unbearable than just keeping the chewed food in your mouthMy teenage son fresh out of the shower doesn\u2019t seem to think so.\n\nI\u2019m like, \u201cDude, If you just put your dirty drawers back on after a shower, you may as well not bother.\u201dWhen it\u2019s summer and you\u2019re sweaty and you go pee and then have to pull your sweaty underwear back up. NOPENah, it's so much more enjoyable. They feel so naturali was thinking about this recently. sometimes i go to take a shower and think \"i'll just throw that shirt and those shorts back on aftwrwards, they're still clean.\" then I get out of the shower and I'm like... \"oh no way in hell are these FILTHY ARTICLES going back on my PRISTINE body\".\n\nthen it's time for the awkward towel wrapped walk to my room while i hope the parents don't see.Yea kinda like how dirty girls are amazing to go to bed with but embarrassing to wake up next to.Damn. Didn\u2019t know much about this guy?As a sweaty bald man, I can confirm this x100 with taking off a baseball cap. I pull it off to wipe the sweat off my head and then immediately regret what I know is coming when I put it back on.I call it the dirty differential. Im clean and I don't want to wear dirty clothes.This is true, specially when it's hot, it simply disgusting taking yout sweating t shirt off and reputtingit  after sometimeIt sounds unbearable. How much would that be?The same applies to saliva. Once it leaves your month it's dirty AFLost Legacy is up there.This is the same case for wet clothes.There are a very few amount of people who put on dirty clothes. I've seen one or two in my life.Yea I\u2019m dirty mindedIt\u2019s like an apple. It\u2019s much less attractive when you leave it there for a minute and it oxidizesThat\u2019s two more!Oh man backpacking flashbacks. I think I packed three shirts for the week. Rinsing it off in the stream just isn\u2019t the same.Peeing in a pool is not as bad as peeing into a pool...Don't join the army...Thas why you in the shower mateOr putting clean clothes on your dirty body before having a shower.so trueInertia...and that\u2019s how society works.The washing machine at my house was broken from February until last week. Having to put on dirty clothes day after day like that was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I'm so grateful to be able to wear clean clothes again.I mean I just feel the dirt when I put on dirty clothes. If I never take them off, I won\u2019t knowThe killer line \u2018I\u2019m keeping that onePONCHO!!\n\nShe\u2019s still dependent on herContinuity, I suppose.Putting your wet swimsuit back on after using the washroom.Hi gay, I'm not so self assuredUnpopularopinionIt\u2019s like the frog jumping out of the already hot frying pan but chilling in the slowly heating frying pan.Have you ever tried eating without a table?hmmmmmGave me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about itWhy is that so true?Those with higher standards are more easily disappointed. You won\u2019t know the difference if you had kept the clothes on - but for the love of god please don\u2019t actually apply that logic to this situationEven if I wore that cloth for half an hour, that's dirty. Go to the pile of dirty clothes on the chair in my room. Bye bye.ITT: a lot of people who actually wash their clothesDepends how dry everything's becomeThere once lived a man in Peru who dreamt he was ejaculating into his shoe.  \nHe woke with a fright in the middle of the night and fucking wore his shoes anyway.Having wet socks is bad putting on wet socks is just unholyHaving wet socks is bad putting on wet socks is just unholythat's why you just don't shower and sleep in your clothes!I was just talking about this today! I never wear a shirt twice without washing between wears. My husband laughed because while discussing this he pointed out that I've been wearing the same shirt for 3 days (I'm in my lounging clothes and haven't left the house, don't judge) to which I immediately replied that I hadn't taken my shirt off. Once the shirt comes off, it doesn't go back on.\nSide note: I have since put on a new shirt.Why does it feel like that though?If I go swimming, I can't put my underwear back on. Makes me feel gross and dirty.I mean duhI shit my pants while desperately trying to make it to the restroom at work. It was horrible... through the boxers and down both legs. I took them off and cleaned myself up with soap, warm water and paper towels. Thinking of my next move, I remembered we had some Tyvek suits in the parts room that I could wear home. But how would I get from the restroom to the parts room to retrieve the Tyvek? Yeah... had to put my freshly shitted pants back on and penguin walk across the shop. Worst ten minutes of my life.It's like licking your food before you eat it, vs someone else licking your food before you eat itSometimes I get a sock so crusty, it\u2019s still crusty after I wash it.Same goes for taking them off. InertiaPuttin wet clothes on is also pure hell.I don't know about anywhere else, but in Oregon when they put you in jail they expect you to put the same pair of socks on 4 days in a row, and believe me, doing that after you've showered, on that 4th day, is just disgusting.Not the same issue but I really don't understand peple that get sweaty from excercise and put on their clothes without showering ( if possible ofc).Putting cold wet clothes back on is worse.Well you can eat them(\\___/)\n| -   -|\n \\_     \\\n     \\    \\\n       \\    \\\n         \\    \\\n          |   |\n          |   |\n   ___ /__ /___Similar concept as things are only gross once they\u2019re no longer inside of youI haven't changed my socks in weeksSeems like a post-shower thoughtIf I had nothing but dirty clothes I would rather stay naked.....same goes for wet socksMy soccer stuff is going on its third season.

It doesn\u2019t matter how long I\u2019ve warm it 5mins or 5hrs. I\u2019ve tried so many times and it freaks me out.Now this is a TRUE shower thoughtThis feels like it was actually thought up while in the shower.Idk putting back on a wet swim suit after you have dried off is worse.Shout out to middle school gym class.I think clothes like the [bohemian pants](https://thaiharempants.net/category/bohemian/) and shirts are chosen very carefully and according to the trend.Not if you have depression.I disagree depending on how dirty. I wear the same socks 2 ton3 days in a row and the same work pants about all week. Fresh boxers and fresh t-shirt atleast once a day sometimes multiple.\n\nI absolutely have to change my shirt after work before the gymNot just dirty clothes.  If I put a shirt on for 5 minutes and take it off.  I can't put it back on.Same with condoms.I disagree. I wear dirty clothes whenever I feel like not doing laundry at the time and am not going somewhere I need to interact. They work just fine and I only notice if I'm thinking about it. \n\nOn a similar note, if I'm going to be working with shovels and mud I will never throw on a clean pair of clothes.old clothes put in mouthYou sir, are officialy a bum.Ewe!This became my most upvoted comment about 7 upvotes agoUnbearable.

Or do you go from foot to dryer?Not gonna lie, merino wool socks are a game changer.

I can't justify going through double the amount of socks for that one dog walk as soon as I wake up\n\nI'll literally never not once in the history of all time take a shower and put a non fresh pair on.Dude, just jam your dirty socks into your clean socks drawer. Unless it is smell, you basically will just wear it again.>( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\ufe3b\u0337\u253b\u033f\u2550\u2501\u4e00-My feet barely sweat.

Oil doesn\u2019t dry overnight.When I worked in fast food 35 hours a week, they only gave us one uniform.  We could purchase a second one if we wanted, but they paid us $5.15/hour, so no.  It was so disgusting.Thank you but I do not wish to imagine it. \n\n\nI really like the idea of hiking the Appalachian trail one day, but I know the lack of showers and clean clothes is gonna do me in by week one.Yeah, I can handle putting in dirty clothes no problem, especially if the innermost layer (socks, underwear) aren't sandy or whatever. But wet clothes? No, no, that's not happening, if I'm catching pneumonia either way, I'll do it without putting wet clothes on. \n\nWorst I've suffered through is changing back into a swimsuit I'd used an hour before, that took me like half an hour. I'm enjoying my privilege of being allowed to pack multiple pairs of socks per day of hiking.Ord loOrd loI wore the same uniform for 23 days in the desert at the peak of summer, I changed socks a few times and maybe t shirt twice.  I just slept in it when I could sleep.  That thing stood up on its own when I took it off.My niece did similar Marine officer training at Quantico, VA.  Cold, rainy, and miserable.  She slept in a hole she gouged out of the earth.  Badass.I'm a simple man, I expect Ord lo and I upvote\n\nOrd loMalay?I did a 12 day hike once, no showers and only 2 sets of clothes. Even though it was challenging it was one of the best experiences in my life.I didn't wash my undershirt for an entire football season. After practice, off it came, and right into the overhead cubby where it stayed locked up until next practice. Mud, sweat, blood, you name it had that shirt stiff enough to snap in half by the end of the season. The locker room smelled awful and getting staph was basically a rite of passage. My senior year, the coaches ordered everyone practice shirts and did laundry every day because they couldn't stand the smell. Being a teenager, it never really bothered me.I can, I went on a 2 week budget trip with some friends to Spain. I packed 2 pairs each of underwear, socks and shirts. Two shoes cuz fuck that noise. And one pair of shorts. This was also the time I got lost on a mountain. I forgot it gets cold at night. Protip :don't go to Spain if you don't know SpanishIt's a no from me dogYou only get 3 days of rations for 10 days?

What are yall doing?>nothing better than sliding into a nice pair of warm soaking wet denim pants\n\nUnless you got powder on your legs and it forms a paste!Warm? Warm is bearable, try cold and wet denim. Putting back on cold clothes is infinitely worse.Exactly! Also, how dirty is dirty? I assume these people wear their trackies around the house more than once. Also, I have a pair of gardening clothes that only get washed when I have a 'dirt/dog hair' load to do. Also also, I don't wear stinky clothes out in public, but I really do love living in my own filth while camping. I wash my hands and face a lot, but the rest of me can get fucked (while camping. And also, if I'm honest, if I never had to see another person again. But out of politeness I wash myself)The real LPT is always in the comments lolI have a magic corner. I throw my clothes there, & if I leave them long enough, they reappear washed & folded in my drawer.\n\nThe perks of marrying someone who's waaaaay more of a neat freak than you.It feels so weird putting it back on after you\u2019ve dried off already. It\u2019s also extremely difficult on most occasionsOmg trying to squeeze my fat arse back into my \"shape forming\" wet bathers after going to the toilet is absolutely exhausting. Wonder what the neighbouring cubicals think.or hairi always carry a clean shirt and underwear, toothbrush, deodorant in my carry on/laptop bag when flying anywhere.True. I've never washed my current pairNo, also with jeans you filthy bastard.Really? I imagine every single person alive (excepting perhaps people born in truly excess wealth) would have experienced this. Even they might have.\n\nSomeone commented about the time they lost their baggage and had to spend the night at a hotel with the stuff they came in. Maybe you have gone on a trip and miscalculated how much to bring. Maybe your washing machine broke at a bad time, or you know, literally anything else interfered with your normal laundry routine. Heck, my mother died this January, and I certainly wasn't focused on laundry. Thankfully my husband was able to think about that stuff, but my newly widowed father no longer had anyone like that.The difference is fluids, especially bodyily fluids, like sweat. Doesn't still have to be wet, though.Gonna be honest. I disagree. Are the bacteria levels worse? Yes, but holy fuck the physiological stress of putting on dirty clothes is unbearable lolI can wear the same clothes day/night in and out for a week, but when i finally develop the superhuman strength to have a shower (or at least change clothes when i sleep) wild dogs couldnt stop me from putting on clean \"inner\" clothes.No, it doesn't. You feel absolutely disgusting, you just don't (can't) do anything about it, and that ends up just feeding your negative thought patterns.seriously though, good denim shouldn\u2019t be washed all that often[deleted]Wait until you see my work clothes.\n\nI'm a plumber, fyi.Have you seen threads where someone mentions they don't shower literally every day, and maybe they skip a day if they were just hanging out at home?I like to say it's for emergencies, but it's really just lazinessBro you gotta let them dry out. I'd go barefoot for a day before I'd put on wet socks. My feet go from clean to trench foot in like 2 days tops.[removed]That smell will never come out! No more fryers for me.I...I think your priorities are askewThat....that did not turn out how I hoped...Not remotely true. You feel absolutely disgusting, you just don't (can't) do anything about it, and that ends up just feeding your negative thought patterns.NiceRookie numbers. I\u2019m already in the triple digits.I actually felt really clever doing this a couple years ago. Every day after work during the winter I'd go to my mom's house to practice guitar for a bit. Only problem was my socks were always soaking wet from sweat and melted snow and I had no extra clothing there except for a single pair of socks I found one time. \n\nSo I kept this rotation going where I'd take off todays wet ones, flop them on the floor and then put on yesterday's socks that were all dried by then and then rinse and repeat. \n\nIn my mind it was like infinite dry socks without needing to carry around multiple pairs of socks every day or doing extra laundry for just socks.[deleted]Wait a second...How do I delete someone else\u2019s comment?This man socksIf you don't crunch them up, they retain the shape of your feet! \n\nIt's like paper mache, but with skin.Dude you are sick \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02*Flashback to tour*Those are rookie numbers Johnson.This is what me and my friends did in High School during football season.\n\nWe wouldn't wash anything.  The first person to wash anything lost the game.  No one wanted to lose the game, so no one washed anything.  It smelled so fucking bad in the locker room.  Putting on crunchy clothes was the worst.i'm disgusted just pull the socks over the blades of a fan. will speed up the processOk seriously though, one of the grossest things I\u2019ve ever done was toward the end of a 24 hour bus ride, after wearing the same socks and shoes for the entire time, I had had enough. My boyfriend and I switched socks, just to have a different feeling on our stinky old feet. That was some serious crunch, and there was no dry time.Bro. Ew.I was just about to say i just wore merino wool socks for 7 days while backpacking, they were dirty yeah but not horrible to wear. Definitely a game changerI only own merino wool socks. No cotton for me anymore.Wool unfortunately makes me itch. I\u2019ve worn them before, and they\u2019re nice. But I can only wear them for an hour or two before I find myself wanting to take them off and soak my feet in warm water. They\u2019re nice for backpacking, but I need to wear a liner if I\u2019m going to have them on for an extended period of time.\n\nFor those who are wondering, wool socks tend to \u201cfeel\u201d less gross because the wool is naturally antibacterial. On a sheep, this helps prevent infection. In socks, this means they don\u2019t get as gross and smelly, because they just don\u2019t seem to \u201chold\u201d the grossness as much. It just sort of dissipates as the sweat dries.Damn it Reddit. Now I have to research and buy a pair. Ode to all the crap I buy bc I read some random post.Wool socks make my feet sweat and tingleI never knew people felt this way until I used Reddit. I guess I was blessed with feet that don\u2019t sweat because I have never had a problem putting on worn socks. Even after working outside in sweltering heat my feet don\u2019t sweat.Thats not normal ? You guys toss your socks after every use?i\u2019m sure in every other respect your husband is a normal and upstanding citizen but this would\nhonestly be grounds for divorce for meMom's spheggtiLet alone if it's encrusted in spaghetty.For what it's worth, you never really get the grease out. I worked at a burger place for six months out of hs. And don't they really only provide the shirts? I guess some places require they provide more, but usually they just give the shirts.\n\nNo matter how religiously you clean those black pants, the grease smell never fully leaves. Same with the shoes.Yeah,  I work for a big grocery chain that does the same.  You get one new shirt every year,  otherwise you need to pay for them. The shirts fit badly too, like the designers have never even looked at a human woman before in their livesI did an Outward Bound program through the NC section for a month when I was 14 and half of us got \u2018scratchy heat\u2019. to this day I don\u2019t know what it is medically\u2026but it happens when you don\u2019t shower for a month, hike 8+ miles a day, and feels like bugs on fire running under your skin. whenever we saw fresh water deep enough for our bodies we\u2019d practically cry. slept under a tarp with a sheet tucked under me and over my head like a mummy every night because morning 1 I woke up with Daddy Long Legs ALL over my sleeping bag and my face. still glad I did it. waking up at a different summit to the sunrise every day was spiritual. plan it out, pack light, and go with an open mind and a waterproof satellite phone! it will rain every day lolThere\u2019s an audio book of a guy that hiked the trail and there\u2019s stops along the way.\n\nPlus there are shorter trails or you could do section hikes.i did a 5-day hiking trip from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sea of Galilee last summer, in July. the middle east in July is no joke. there was no way to bathe the entire time, other than taking a dip in a mountain spring that we came across on the trail. we camped every night of course, and throughout the day we peed behind bushes along the trail. which, as a girl, meant try to drip dry for a few seconds, then give up and pull your shorts back up. the shower i had after that trip was over was one of the best showers of my life. i'd never felt so different after bathing.Was on the AT for 5 months.  Putting on dirty clothes wasn't so bad because, hey I'm still dirty from yesterday.  Putting on wet clothes tho... Especially wet socks.  Just so unpleasant.  Luckily, that only happened to me in the Smokies where the rain was unrelenting.If you want to do a long hike with more regular showers, I would recommend the Camino (El Camino de Santiago) in Spain. \n\nI did the French route starting from Sarria. I can't comment on the earlier part of the trail, but it was pretty luxurious compared to backpacking in the woods. You stay in Albergues (inns and hostels) along the way with access to showers and proper meals and coffee pretty much anywhere you stay. This also means that you don't need to carry a whole lot. \n\nThat said, I went before all the Covid-19 was a thing, so I'm not sure how that will change the experience. I also happen to know Spanish, so that's another caveat, but I think it's still doable even if your Spanish is limited.[deleted]There\u2019s also this whole hidden dark side to that hike with lots of sexual assaults and missing women hikers that really gets glossed over in everything about the Appalachian trail hike.There\u2019s no worse wet blanket than putting on a dirty pair of soggy socksYeah broHow do you know someone went to OCS? They'll tell youOrd broDid that over 2 years mate. Never again - had to use a shovel for 3 days straight (no sleep) to dig a fire trench that ripped off the top few layers of my skin on both hands.\n\nHave engineers gloves but my shovel made quick work of my 3 sets.Good our officers do it as well. Enlisted did that shit at SOI/MCT. When I told my family I slept in a wet hole they couldn't believe it. I can now wear dirty clothes, sleep on gravel and eat cold unappetizing food. I'm set for life lol.Ord lo bro!Thats it. Ill never do it again though! HahaI would think it's likely that they had to find some other food sources; there's no way that could sustain you over 10 days.Oh bro - would have totally driven to a store of clothes  !Hahaha JCC!Ord loOrd broIn was in tents.Here, let me help you with that.\n\nStudies have revealed that jeans worn for a year, pending actual mud or other fluids, carry relatively the same amount of germs they did from day one.Don\u2019t forget the freshly showered in socks.Sweat really is the difference. If you've sweat in it, it feels disgusting to put back on. Other bodily fluids too.\n\nFor instance, women can have discharge on the regular, and if you don't have a liner or whatever...it doesn't feel bad until you pull them down to go to the bathroom or whatever and then you suddenly feel disgusting.Camping is a different world, I love to be a dirtbag in nature. I do have to brush my teeth from time to time, though.[removed]Man, I know you're probably joking, but [I hope you've got an even division of chores in your household](https://www.workingmother.com/this-comic-perfectly-explains-mental-load-working-mothers-bear#page-8).Lol I\u2019m now at the stage I pull down gusset and yank to one side to avoid this at all costs. My daughters are at an age now where I say to them \u201cnothing worst then putting wet bathed back on\u201d, lol!Simple solution is to just keep the hair in your mouth.  Don't let it out and there's no problem.and slippers, you don't wanna wear shoes for a 13 hours flight.-How long have you had them?Absolutely! I upvoted the above comment before realising i had read it the wrong way around! I can leave clothes on for ages but the second they have been off my body (and it's particularly worse once they have lost my body heat), it is unbearable to me to put them back on (obviously different for \"outer\" clothes that dont directly touch my skin)I recently had to start showering once a day to keep a wound clean.  My wife (who has always showered every day) noticed that I sure was showering a lot.  And now my armpits smell for the first time in my life.  Like, as soon as I get out of the shower.  It's like I stripped off my natural layer of neutral resiliency.  Also, I'm a grown ass man.Yeah I agree that I probably pushed it too far with the socks. I tried to soak my feet in a stream and wash them regularly to prevent foot fungus. I just didn\u2019t want to get my 2nd pair of socks wet if I knew it would rain. I also dried my feet out every night.What?People experience depression in different ways.You guys take your socks off? I'm still wearing mine from birth.In middle school I was too lazy to bring new socks to gym class. I kept and used the same pair of socks in my locker for the entire year...  \ud83d\ude2cim glad you\u2019re doing better these daysThat's a legitimate thing, especially in winter survival. Dry your socks at night over the fire or even freeze the sweat on them, crumple them up and wear them again. The crumpling helps maintain loft in the fibres and increases warmth.Perfectly balanced as all things should be.That is repulsive what the fuck>except for a single pair of socks I found one time.\n\nHad some random stranger not left behind their socks, or whatever was the case, imagine how different your life would be! Not that you could because the way in which differences would snowball would be entirely unpredictable, in my opinion.How many crispy socks is she gonna find, dawg?Crispy makes them sound nice...\n\nMore like crunchy socksWhy do socks get crispy anyway? It's the only article of clothing that doesNo he don't sock. You sockBut if you DO, it restores some air pockets back into the fibres and helps with warmth.Staph infection intensifiesMerino wool specifically makes you itch? Because merino wool is hypoallergenic unlike regular wool. Reddit has cost me more than my kids haha. Smart wool is good. Darn Tough socks are better (in my opinion). They're exoensice, but I have hundreds of miles on a few pairs & there still going strong.Try merino wool if you've only tried regular wool socks. Super soft and way less itchy than regular wool. I find it better at wicking away moisture than any other material.Do you sweat buckets? I only get tingly feet from soaking wet socks, and that's of any material. Likely because it shrinks a bit as it dries out.Yea reading these comments Im so confused. My socks still look fresh washed after one use. I didnt know people had such sweaty feet!My feet don't sweat,  but it still grosses me outNo like,  not wash them and rewear them later in the dayKnees weak arms are heavyThey gave us shirts, pants, and a hat.Use a dap of dawn in every load. Just enough not to make a bubble bath every load.Check your local thrift store, sometimes you can find ones from old employees that might fit better.You could try getting them tailored. I found it was a good subtle way of standing out and being looking more professional in previous jobs.Go without one, borrow one of theirs \u201cfor the day\u201d and just never return itIt's called heat rash. Its when your pores are so clogged up with dirt that it gets heavily irritated. And becahse your hands are probably dirty, scratching it seems to alleviate the issue, but it only makes it worse. pretty much the only cure is a good hard scrub, and avoid aggravating the skin further. \n\nsauce: similiar army experience with OP, and we're from the same country. wadioI did outward bound when I was 16, it was 12 days through a mountainous region of eastern Australia. One of the best experiences of my life. I really didn't mind the not showering part you get used to it. Humans are supposed to smell like BO it's natural, I think in modern society were too obsessed with cleanliness, and covering up our natural scent.I find it very strange to refer to \"A Walk in the Woods\" as an audiobook, as if that is its intended, only, or even original form. I can't really put my finger on why exactly, but in this context \"audiobook\" doesn't sound right.\n\nLike if someone asked me what I like to listen to, \"I've gotten into audiobooks lately\" sounds fine, but you wouldn't say, \"I'm listening to an audiobook called Harry Potter,\" you'd just say book.\n\ne: To be clear, I have no issue with audiobooks, the WWZ audiobook is one of the best experiences I've had with media in any form, I just think it's weird to refer to a book as an audiobook in this context.What a fucking let down that was.I did a three-day trip (also July) in the other direction, starting at the kinneret and ending at the beach near Haifa.  There was no bathing along the way, but I likewise remember that swim when we got to the ocean.  Just dropping my dusty, sweaty clothes and diving into the waves.  So refreshing.  But in the spirit of OP's post, I also remember having to put those dirty, sweaty clothes back on for the bus ride home.  Ugh.Have you been seeing someone about it?\n\nIt seems to be a rather common condition, similar to OCD, with quite a wide spectrum, so I would think it is treatable (or \"improvable\"), do you know about that?\n\nIf someone washes their hands very often or just wastes a lot of time overcleaning kitchen counters, not a big deal, but if they're at the stage where it destroys relationships (or even just causes constant anxiety), then it becomes quite serious.Not really. As it's said in the book, the trail is generally considered to include the connecting trails and the land immediately beside it. If you draw a line 2000 miles long and 100 feet wide anywhere in America, there's going to be crime in it. It being the AT doesn't have much to do with thatWhat do you call the cadet who barely passed all assessments?\n\nSir!Hahaha - i can't do that suit again broI have many friends who have gone through the same course OP described, there\u2019s actually a component where you have to kill a live quail and eat it. You may or may not get extra rations depending on performance throughout the course I.e. catching a monitor lizard during your survival phase with a self-made trap. you will be awarded with an additional ration (1/3 of it actually) as a reward.\n\nI also have a friend who was vegan due to religious reasons, he had to undergo the same course with vegan rations (less calories) and couldn\u2019t eat the quail he killed... he did just fine with the 3 packs of ration throughout the 10 days. It\u2019s definitely possible, our ranger course see worse as they get severely less rations then the jungle course described.>there's no way that could sustain you over 10 days. \n\nUm, it absolutely could. Presumably the goal was for them to hunt/forage or whatever, but healthy people could definitely live off 3 days rations for 10 days.If it was an option, I would\u2019ve. But I was in the woods, in Maine, miles from anywhere that sold clothingoof good god glad you survived thatWith or without washing?It gets all cold if you sit there for too longIf you are constantly disappointed, there's a very good chance! HahaAh yes, my weekly 13 hour flight...why not? I regularly wear shoes for 13+ hours every day?lol they said *crickets*You don't want to knowStudies have shown that the optimal frequency for showering is something like 3x/week. Just like people have discovered that harsh anti-acne treatments can make acne worse because it dries out the skin, forcing our glands to produce more oil...\n\nThe funny thing is people will tell you that if showering makes your skin dry to just use lotion. Not only does lotion not really make skin less dry (it just gets rid of some of the symptoms of dry skin), it is also encouraging people to keep slapping more products on instead of treating the problem (over showering).\n\nOur current society is obsessed with hygiene and refuses to admit that the things they insist make things better actually makes things worse. You don't stink if you don't shower every day, washing clothes because they touched your body for 10 minutes is wasteful, sanitizer kills good germs as well as bad, and antibiotics don't help the common cold.Well yes, but you didn't say \"not if your depression is like mine\", you said \"not if you have depression\".Wait, don\u2019t people grow socks by themselves?Came out the WOMB wearing these boys!That\u2019d be a dope evolutionary feature for future babiesBruh they wank with their socksSunk cost, babyand that's coz your mom buys big clothes saying you'll get bigger one daynice try, but those aren't socks Mr. Hobbit.isn't that your foreskinHello Mr GroatCan someone please draw a picture of iAlwaysLack with a normal sized body, but baby sized feet?!? It might be the lack of sleep talking but that could be hilariousThey for sale tho? Asking for a friend...Laughed too hard at this lolIf you get wool socks they won't get hard when they dry.[deleted]Yummy.    :-()Merino still has lanolin, which is a waxy oil coating produced by the sheep. That waxy coating is part of what makes the wool antibacterial. Merino has significantly less lanolin than regular wool, but it still has enough to cause reactions in those who are sensitive to it. Merino has a significantly smoother hair fiber, so it isn\u2019t as scratchy. But the scratchiness isn\u2019t actually what causes irritation for folks who are sensitive to lanolin.\n\nI can wear alpaca wool, because alpacas don\u2019t produce lanolin. It isn\u2019t as smooth as merino, (so it\u2019s slightly more scratchy,) but lacks the irritating lanolin.oh, man.  i love wool socks.  especially during the summer.  it sounds insane,  but my feet are always dry.Vomit on his sweater alreadyDirty socks on his sweater alreadyHuh, interesting. In both my state and the one I grew up in, they are only required to provide clothing that is explicity \"their's\", as in has a logo or design of some sort. Anything generic, like \"black polo\" or \"khakis\" you have to buy yourself.\n\nThey can even require you buy shoes through them and make you pay for it. So long as the shoes aren't \"their's\".There is no reason for this comment to get downvotes. If you disagree, say why.I know what you mean. I've been listening to the audiobook of The Lord of the Rings and switching between \"I'm reading LOTR\" and \"im listening to the audiobook of LOTR\" is easy to kinda sub in.\n\nIt's easier to say I'm reading it. More concise. But disingenuous because I am not reading it lol. I'm driving to work. But I am listening so intently I might as well be reading.\n\nAnd then the audiobook can kinda be a format of it's own. Phil Dragash reading LoTR is an insane difference from reading it. He does every single voice, he has ambience and background music. It truly is more akin to a radio play than a book. Despite it being word for word from the book.\n\nAlthough this might distract from the core material and book, I dont think that's ever anyone's intention.[deleted]Pro tip! Get in the body of water with your clothes on, wash them while on your body, then get nekkie and wash yourself (must have at least one dry set to put on while just-washed clothes dry). I do prefer to bring with me a small loofa and Dr. Bronner's. I spent 6 months researching in Africa, which meant sleeping outside. Also worked out west where we had 14 day hitches where we only camped. Also, many backpacking trips, but this has been my favorite method of making sure me and my clothes stay clean and not too smelly while living outdoors for long periods of time.It absolutely did. And we had food left over. We got 4 meal packs (2x lunch and 2x dinner) for the whole time.[deleted]Yes!!! Ugh.ugh, I hate that feeling when you\u2019re wearing a pad and don\u2019t have another or can\u2019t change it for whatever reason. i physically recoil every time.You don\u2019t take those? You peasantSitting down for 13 hours is different from doing everyday stuff for 13 hours.By that standard you said \u201cYOU feel absolutely disgusting\u201d not \u201cI feel absolutely disgusting.\u201dmost people get their birth socks circumcised, my feetskins are still uncutI hear people also change their shoes. I haven\u2019t taken mine off since I sprayed them on.I was born in my birthday suit. Pretty slick. Free socks. Everything free.That's called *fungus*.[Gotchu](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)Well they still do get stiff and flat, but not nearly as much as cotton. Plus wool retains something like 70% of its insulating properties even when wet.Ah you didn't have the full quote beforeYeah I have to wear steel toe boots all day at work and agree.  They\u2019re also great for backpacking - two pairs, one for hiking and one for night time. They\u2019re really good at not getting stinky too.Wear it againy.Then you can wear my sweatshirt\n\nAnd you can tell your friends we'll be together till the endBecause body odor smells like shit when you're caked in 2+ days of it.  Plenty of natural things are terrible.  Acting like 12 days of no showering is superior to being clean is silly.Yup! That's the one!You guys wash your jeans?I've been wanting to relate to someone about that, but it's never come up in conversation until now hahaOh god, that's the worst!That's the standard you applied, not me. You failed to live up to your standard.\n\nAnd last I checked, \"you\" was a general plural as well as a specific singular in English.\n\nBut sure, keep spreading misinformation about depression.Thanks for making me uncomfortable.Humanity was a mistake and whatever judgement we face at the end of days won't be enough.r/cursedcommentsu/BUTTCHEF cookin' up that nastyCloudy with a chance of meatballshow you gonna get them off, nerd?Free mohair shorts with matching underarm pads!You made me blow snot into my face mask... which I guess is the whole point of the face mask. Except now I have to pretend its not there until I am safe...Fuck this got me good thank youYo dude, it was a joke to help me make a heavy thing I deal with a little lighter. It isn't \"misinformation.\" Due to my depression I'll put on dirty clothes without thinking twice about it, and not feel any certain way about it. I'm sure plenty of other people with depression do the same thing. You being a pedantic shit about a joke isn't really helping anyone.(\\\\____/)\n\n( \ud83d\udc41 \u035c \u0296 \ud83d\udc41)\n\n\\\u256d\u261e \\\u256d\u261eHe just throws in some baby batter, gold bonds them, then wears them like freshly starched socks.Yes random citizen.\"Nerd\"is still hilarious to me.Another Canadian here, I give you upGod\u2019s speedWell that inaccurate portrayal of depression actively makes me day worse. It is \"misinformation\", plain and simple.\n\nYou making jokes that contribute to poor understanding of depression isn't helping anyone either.[deleted]Did you mean to reply to me? Unsure of what you mean...Whoa, whoa, whoa...I thought it was just Michael J. Fox and Matthew Perry up there. There is even more of you adorable Hamster people?How is giving someone insight into someone else\u2019s depression \u201ccontributing to a poor understanding of it?\u201d It\u2019s literally a primary source of information.

So as long as you land your ship on a part of a planet thats at an equivalent hour of the day as your body clock, you oughtta be fine.And yet no one was caught snoozing during a Senate hearing or Jedi Council meeting after battles in star systems super far away. Not once Qui Gon was knocked out and Obi Wan had to bail him out cause they were on Geonosan time or somethingNot really, with hyperspace capabilities itd just be a matter of maintaining your sleep cycle.Explains why Han is always grumpy.I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this recently, they show up on every planet and seem okay, they sleep in their ships, they must have their own time and the planet\u2019s time like here and it must just be really different. Also, how do they regulate time if everyone\u2019s rotations are different and they have different lengths of time to travel around their sun?Warp lag maybe?there's only 1 town on each planet anyway\"Jetlag is a non issue due to light speed\" - my roommateJust land on the equivalent side of the planet that you left from.It would suck to wake up, fly lightspeed across the galaxy for 10 seconds, arrive at a ship with a badass restaurant, show up when it's closed because that is the time everybody has agreed on as sleepy timeWhen they are traveling at the speed of light, time basically stops.Just pop a couple death sticks once you land and you\u2019ll be feelin a- okay my friend \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffcWhen the hell do they sleep?It's really not that bad, you can get anywhere in the galaxy pretty quickly when traveling at the speed of plot.[deleted]Damn I bet I've slept maybe 48 hours in the past 12 yearsJet Lag is a cicadian rhythm issue right? Well you can adjust your sleep through scheduling and take drugs to reset your system.  Or the space faring species of Star Wars don't have cicadian rhythm's.So that\u2019s why the stormtroopers are terrible shotsImagine living in a planet with 2 suns... And full of sand.I think of that a lot when people talk of colonizing mars and the moonIt's called hyperspace madness.Don't worry, ever since episode 8 nothing really matters because we're subverting expectations and keeping the viewer off balance. Oh lightspeed? Yeah it doesn't work the way it used to in the previous 7 movies. I hope you're keeping up! What a twist!!Is time referenced in Star Wars?Jet lag isn't real. It's made up by energy drink companies to sell more caffeine.\n/sThey counteracted jet lag by measuring time in parsecsI started reading this like \"Jet lag\" was in germanMotion sickness is probably worse. I'm guessing there is a thriving Dramamine industry in the SW universe. Maybe even a whole clan. The banking clan, the mining clan, the Dramamine clan.Thing is, if you\u2019re travelling to another planet, wouldn\u2019t jet lag be obsolete since you could land in any timezone you wanted to, and therefore stay in the same timezone you\u2019re used to?I would knowhave you heard of lightspeed skipping lolThey do have a different sleep schedule than their distention but they have space drugs and machines to adjust. They will be fineEspecially when basically the entirety of a faction is permanently based in space, like the Empire in ESBCHEWIE HIT THE snoooooorrrrreesdeJet lag is shit in generalSpace jet lagIt's never been a problem on Star Trek either.  Only once have they ever referred to time that I can recall.They probably default to the time on Coruscant as it\u2019s the capitalSomeone please put a gif of Kevin Hart looking all amazed an shit. Cause thats how i feel rn.actually this was in dark apprentice i believe, luke got pissed at han for calling him at 3 in the morning when it was noon on corscauntAre there timezones in space?Hyper speed exists so probably notNot at all.  Time is set to a galactic standard, and business conducts within acceptable parameters likely localized on some planets.  \n\nIt\u2019d be like if Earth killed time zones and we just ran off of GMT. It would be weird in certain places due to sun position at the time, but ultimately everyone would get used to it and it\u2019d be irrelevant.If you depart from the daytime side of a planet you just land on the daytime side of your destination planet.  Easy.Fun fact, they all go off of Coruscant Standard Time (bc the Senate said so) so yes, the daylight may be different, but it\u2019s 2 AM on Coruscant in the same place it\u2019s 2 AM on a planet, so speaking logically, it\u2019s no worse than if you were to, say, fly from Hong Kong to New York, and that\u2019s not even always the case.Damnit, I thought of this like 3 days ago but I never thought about posting hereIn the Mass Effect Universe the alien species deal with this idea by all having a set time and a sol time. Sol time is the sun\u2019s time depending on the solar system. But Set time is 100 hours 100 minutes and 100 seconds for everyday and every sentient species uses this method. \nTho we all know space and time would have an effect and adjustment would still be needed, and your bodies circadian rhythm wouldn\u2019t change just because a new measurement of time. So idk. My comment is moot.That\u2019s why we dream of fairytales,Not necessarily. As some others have noted here you can just land in a part of the destination planet that would be on roughly the same time you left five or take a bit.\n\nIn space base time is Galactic Standard based off of the rotation and orbit of Coruscant the traditional capital of the republic. Coruscant has basically earth\u2019s orbital period and rotation give or take. \n\n\nAdditionally talking into account [Hyperspace ](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperspace) travel and the ridiculously fast galactic travel speeds in play and you\u2019re probably not looking at much difference necessarily. I\u2019d imaging for real long journeys you\u2019d be in a vessel that has a bunk, in which case you\u2019d acclimate to the destination time on the voyage.Not to be a turd, but Star Wars is in our universe. Just in another galaxy. A long time ago. Far, far away.ITT:  why do people sleep? Cuz they get sleepy.In Star Wars, the time is standardized according to the time of Courscant. So when it is 9:00 on Courscant, it is 9:00 in all the planets.\n\nEdit: [Link to source](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Standard_Calendar)With the light speed jumping, time would essentially stop. So, almost no time really passes during travel and jet lag doesn\u2019t really become a problemI always think about the age differences that would occur when they all travel around the galaxy like that.Mfw I had the [same showerthought](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/68id1a/the_jetlag_must_be_intense_in_the_star_wars/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) two years ago :/Different planets would also have different day lengths too which would screw you up....30 hour days for example...50 hour nights (vitamin D).....varying temperatures/environments.Just listen to Han and shit makes much more sense.You never hear them complain about time zones. Like, how can it be 8am on Tatooine and 8am on the Death Star.I\u2019m sure everyone is making the requisite jokes, so I will point out that this does come up in some of the now defunct EU books.  I wish I could remember which ones, so I\u2019m planting this seed here hoping someone will be able to confirm!Firefly actually acknowledged this problem at one point in the show.\n\nThey were landing the ship and they made a point that it was 10:00am local time, which seemed like it was going to be a burden to Captain Malcom.[deleted]Isn\u2019t jet lag specifically a reference to changing time zones? Interplanetary travel would be tiring for much broader and more obvious reasons.\n\nShower thoughts has turned into a circle jerk of bad analogies and misappropriationsPew pew lagTime dilation. Time is slower when you're movingThis may be the biggest thing they fucked with since the original movie, remember how long it took to get to Alderon/Death Star?Travelling from planet A to planet B, solar systems are equal and in perfect sync, taking off and landing from/on the same polar coordinates as if the planets were spheres: No time difference would be perceived.Time is no longer a thingTime stands still at the speed of light.I don\u2019t know. For me a huge part of jet lag is caused by actually sitting in a cramped and dark plane for hours on end with nowhere to go and nothing to do, and no even remote possibility of good sleep (even on the times I\u2019ve been lucky enough to fly business/first). Take that out with the stupid fast speed of travel, and I don\u2019t think simply adjusting from one time zone to another would be the worst thing.they need to have a sequel where jet lag is the enemy and they find a way to use it to their advantageI don\u2019t think any of them sleep, nobody ever gets a chance to relaxI think that theyre probably used to having strange days. Or maybe they dont ever even sleep, but then again Luke had a bed so who knows?At least 150 pingHow do they keep track of what time it is in whatever galaxy they're in?I think you'd only run into jet lag if you stick to your originating planet's night/day schedule, and try to apply that where ever  you go.\n\nIn space it'd be more efficient to develop a sleep schedule not based on the sun. Time your visits to planets on your waking hours and during the day time of the place you want to go.But don\u2019t they use a universal time code?Actually the planets part of the new republic use Coruscant time, which is the exact same increments as Earth with 24 hour increments and a full rotation around the sun every 365 days.I'm just glad they didn't delete this post.  Mods and bots can be hyper-critical about language sometimes.Fun fact: there is a form of jet lag in star wars, it's called hyper-space sickness.Forget the jet lag, imagine having to adjust to a slightly different gravity each time you land on a different planet.Maybe that's why they always land in the major city on every planet, they're somehow linked by time of day and travel time so the most popular location on any planet  is the spot that provides minimal lagWell it's pretty unlikely any planet you land on will coincidentally have ~24hr day period.\n\nSo have fun with 4 hrs sleep, 8 hrs awake.Can't sleep.  Can somebody just put me into carbon freeze already?It depends which side of the planet they land on, what size the planet is and the planet\u2019s tilt.Ill tell u whats a bitch. A princess trying to find feminine products on a space station populated entirely by men!Well just like everything else in star wars if you disable the \"jet lag generator\" you should be just fine[deleted]Not necessarily. You just land on the side of the next planet where the time is where it would've been on the planet you left.R2 will just hack it or they'll blast the jet lag control panelNah, just wait to land until your destination is when you are.Assuming they have time zones in the infinite universe.Well the thing is, since its all is so interconnected  life continues throughout the night and into the day. Maybe sleeping schedule isnt based on a 24 hour day cycle?How does anyone is star wars have a normal sleep cycle?Not really there's an upper limit on jetlag[deleted]not if your a B1 droid, hail the separatists!Jet lag is a conspiracy, mr. Trump told be it was a tremendous lie.Wait I said this in a comment on a meme last week...Actually it wouldn't matter for trips taking longer than a few days. You can just extend the trip by whatever is required to reach the next whole number in days, thus eliminating the problem of jet lag.\n\nSo if a trip took 5.5 days, they'd just fly around or take a scenic route (every route is scenic I guess) for another half day until they arrive at exactly the time they left.Hyperspace Lag: it\u2019s not the hurtling through space faster than the speed of light that gets you, it\u2019s the sudden stop.Nah, you just land on the part of the planet where it is currently the same time you are on.Traveling at the speed of light causes time to stop. Would you feel anything at all?\u201cThis is your captain C\u2019huck Ya-Gar - we\u2019ll be arriving at your destination Bespin in approximately 3 days 17 hours earlier than when we left Tatooine. Today\u2019s featured moving picture on your holoprojectors is \u201cDon\u2019t Throw Yoda from the Train\u201d and the in flight meal will be a choice of roasted Porg or Colo Claw fish. Enjoy your flight and thanks for flying Solo Air.\u201dUnlike one might think or believe, \"The Star Wars\" is a fictional universe. They don't join in the small factors like jet lag, or breathable air and so on. Like really??I don\u2019t think most average people leave their home planets. For the ones that do they\u2019re probably used to it and just sleep when they\u2019re tired or in hyperspace.I literally spoke this to my wife while watching the mandalorian last nightDefinitelyIs getting in the centre of the universe.\u201dUgh...its like 3AM for me 1840 years from nowWhat about the G\u2019s experienced? They should all be protein paste.But he still chose to be in Star WarsSeems like Lightspeed engines are tuned so that you arrive at a new planet at a time in sync with the time you left the last planet plus travel time so your biorhythms are never off by enough to notice.Warp lagSleep when you're tired... Wake up when you're done sleeping...They probably live on a UTC of sorts, so in reality it's probably not a problem.The farther we get from the gravitational center of our planet - the faster time passes. I wonder if jet lag would have opposite of different effects in hyperspace.\"What local time are we landing at?\"\n\n\"Noonish?\"\n\n\"Augh.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, the day here is like ten-and-a-half hours.\"\n\n*\"Augh!\"*Or the fact they go fasting than the speed of light without entering a wormhole/blackholeIIRC the star wars universe uses a universal time system so everywhere is effectively at the same time all the time. At least in the republic. So a planet doesn't have it's own time, but it would have it's own day night cycle within the universal time system.I get jet lag going to the bathroom.*Hyperspace lag.You just get bloodburn and die. Nbd. HahaThis is something I've never seen addressed in Sci Fi, but now you've brought it up, seems like it would be an issue.  People would be wiped out all over.Staring out the window too much during hyperspace will make you crazy.The force just stays with youI imagine that's why people cared so much about their transport. Half the time you'd probably live in there.I bet in space since there will be infinite planets, there will be a universal time and calendar.All time would be local. \nAdhering to a universal simultaneous time zone across vast stretches of space has no practical purpose. \nWith light speed, you can go wherever you want and arrive whenever you want. Local times for planets light years away could be stored in computers if needed. \nSpace craft in deep space would keep their own time either based on their home world or an arbitrary on board clock. \nFor humans in deep space travel, the ships culture and design would be created to maximize human performance and encourage physical and mental fitness. Lighting would be designed to optimize Terran circadian rhythms by mimicking the course of a sun. Exposure to views of the blackness of space via windows would be limited until after simulated sundown. Smaller ships would run silently at \u201cnighttime\u201d while the sleeping quarters of large craft would be well insulted from sound and vibration. A routine of regulating medication could be employed. There would be a lifestyle of health with vigorous exercise encouraged, along with sports activities and optimized diets. To promote mental health and a healthy communal society, there would be organized social events, programs, interest groups, traditions celebrated and an emphasis in art, music and literature. All this for a good nights rest.The expanse touches on this! There's a planet (Auberon) where the days are so short that the sun rises and sets in like 6 hours, so there's a midnight darkness at \"noon\" and a full moon daylight at \"midnight.\" Some people can't handle it and are extensively medicated to help adjust.They probably have some futuristic meds to deal with it. Every advancement has another advancement to cope with it, eventually.they jump from scene to scene so fast that they got no time to adapt to any time zone anyway it's ok! they're on Republic Standard Time.In the 40k universe ships on long journeys will alter their \u201cday\u201d and\u201dnight\u201d schedules in order to avoid lag upon reaching a planet. One character is able to figure out where they are being sent by using his wristwatch to monitor the difference.Nah it\u2019s so bad, due to different planets having completely different spin rates, even if you showed up at the same \u201chour\u201d relative to your own planet\u2019s time, your sleep cycles are just fucked for a while. Hence, they call it \u201chyper lag,\u201d or even just \u201clag.\u201d It\u2019s such an integral part of Disney\u2019s new universe canon, they heavily integrated it into the latest Battlefront game.Good to know!Nah but g-force on the other hand...> Jet lag must be a real son of a bitch in the Stargate universe\n\nThere, ftfy.So... time is relative. It would probably feel exactly the same as it does on earth.They discuss jet lag a little bit in the book The Queen's Shadow which is about PadmeSummabitchThey sleep? Next you're going to tell me they eat and go to the bathroom.Why would it be any different than jet lag on earth?I assume everyone operates on NEET time. Night is when you're sleepy, day is from when you wake up until when you're sleepy. Whatever, as long as your spacer business gets done, right?Not really. They can just land on that side of the planet where the time is similarHow can they have jet lag when it's based on being put into a time zone your body isnt used to? Since time as we know it is based on the earth rotating around the sun, I think in space, you probably just sleep when you're not getting shot atImagine the clocks going crazyTime dilation is a worse bitch than jet lag.Laughs in shift workOne word: Bacta.I mean they're warping time and space to make it anywhere so time scales have to completely screwed up. If for no other reason that each planet has it's own time scale.Nah, just land on whatever side of the planet where the time of day is what you\u2019re feeling right now.But there\u2019s no day and night in space, i think once you hit planet Side you\u2019ll be hit \u201cIon lag\u201c. Obviously dependent on how many suns and moons that planet has The whole 24 hour system could realistically only work on a few planets in the Star Wars universeLanding on a planet so see a specific character must mean a good chance they're sleeping when you landI think they'd call it something Like HyperLag.Physics don't exist in that universe, so it's fineImagine taking the red eye and you wake up in a different part of the universe.Plasma lag*I guess you don\u2019t understand jet \u201clag\u201d. \n\nNo lag would exist so no lag would bother you.They even have a bad one in 2020?What has got to be really trippy is growing up on a planet with two suns. Commuting to work on a planet with three suns and then vacationing on a planet with one sun! \n\nLike.. what do you mean every day is the same length?!.. that\u2019s a thing?!?!i bet they have some sort of machine or equipment for itMy son is greatful to this day.\n\nhttps://www.target.com/p/3pk-18pc-wooden-dolls-38-figures-bullseye-39-s-playground-8482/-/A-76525739Hmm, assuming it doesn't matter much, you could always land on the city on the surface that corresponds with your internal body clock*\u201dIn space, no one can hear you snore.\u201d*Jetlag is compounded by dehydration and an uncomfortable night sleep. On a humidified comfortable jet with some Temazepam, you'll be fineMore like time-warp lagor in the **guardians of the galaxy**I think it got fixed in the Revenge of the Sith updateI think internet lag would be the bigger issue. Trying to send a text to a different planet? Well you\u2019ll need to wait like 30 yearsDoes space have time zones?You could actually avoid it. If you arrive to a planet, you could just fly to the side of the planet that is at the same time you traveling from ( or as close to as the planets day/night cycle would allow.)Ye but instead of planet times its time dilationFor visiting someone: probably, but for vacation: I don't think so, bacause you would just go to whatever time of day you want.\n\nEdit: Ok, I guass there would still be a problem because of the different daylengthsNot everyone gets jet lag thankfully.They probably evolved to not feel jetlag anymore, since they're already space traveling for hundreds-thousands of years (and generations)As someone that is on the complete opposite side of the world that they live in right now (in Bucharest from San Francisco), I totally agree with this.They're probably used to it, at some point your sleep schedule just switches fasterI'd agreeJet lag wouldn't be real since they didn't have something to measure time withI dunno it seems like lightspeed can get you from Coruscant to Jakku in 10min lolHey kid, it's not that kind of movie.They never land at night.  Easier to get the right exposure that way.\"don't wake me up, I'm several years behind\"Warp lag ...\n\nSeems like it it takes a light year just to walk it off.But that's assuming they have physiological similarities to us humans.I\u2019m pretty sure they all operate on the same time, which is decided on CoruscantMy 85 Y.O grandpa doesn\u2019t believe in jet lag. \n\nHe hops off a plane from Japan to California and already doing yard work within the first hour of getting home. He\u2019s also a workaholic so that\u2019s probably why.It's also crazy that nobody ever complains about their ears bothering them. I couldnt hear right for a day after flying to florida, I can't imagine landing on another planet.Spoken like someone who's never had jetlagAll planets in Star Wars have the same gravity, atmosphere and day/night cycle so they never had to invent jet lag3 months later, I have come back with the solution: Carbonite. Just freeze yourself in that until your destination syncs up with your current rhythm.[removed]Came here to just say that anyone who suffers fron jet lag is a little bitch.\n\nSouce: worker for a 24 hour companyJet lag has nothing to with being tired from sitting on an airplane, like that makes no sense. Jet lag has to do with your body taking time to adjust to new time zones. While traveling can be tiring, that\u2019s not jet lag, that\u2019s just getting up and doing something. What cause the weird scheduled tiredness is rapidly changing time zones without time to adjustNot in the last movie it wasn\u2019t. Considering they skipped around the galaxy like a schizophrenic and never stopped to even change clothes or sleep then I don\u2019t think it was a problem.Just land on the time zone that best fits your sleep schedule.Not so much, because long trips take days to complete. At least they used to when the physics made somewhat sense in the old EU. \n\nBefore the dark times. Before the Mouse...You son of a bitch... I\u2019m in!*MCU joins the chat*Star wars isn't internally consistent enough to have jet lagThe law of relativity clearly doesnt exist o  starwars or else only like 10 mins would have gone by on tatooine while nano would experience 10 years pass.Why? They can fly to any part of the planet they want, to the specific time zone they want.\n\nA bigger problem is the different rotational speeds of different planets, meaning longer or shorter days.This showerthought is stupid.  Jetlag doesnt exist in Star wars, because ships move FTL.A big part of jet lag comes from flying in a cramped cabin with a high cabin pressure altitude and low humidity while breathing high amounts of recycled air. I imagine the spaceship tech would give them optimum air quality and pressure. IMO, the more difficult aspect would be going to planets with different gravity. Big planets with more gravity would be exhausting.For the past time, THEY ARE NOT HUMAN!!! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!!!!!!Make a DLC with new animalsWhy do you think the Storm troopers aim so poorly?For that star wars universe must exist firstJet lag doesn\u2019t exist, I\u2019ve flown many times on long flights either way from the uk to America and not once have I felt anything.\n\nI think people are being hypochondriacs B.  N.  LN UGH I t re Styx? I1Fyo\u00dfyskcd'6_35567+-+Shit crap fart star wars and idiots upvote it.WoooAhH sooO woKe dUDe!!! NeAT sHOWer tHoUgHtIon lag.\n\n(Twin Ion Engine)Is that why they also don't use jetpacks?Intergalactic problems require intergalactic solutionsGOOD point.So how do they melt steel beams?Hyper lag.I go to Japan fairly regularly and the 12 hour jet lag is unreal. I always warn people about it, but they insist that it won\u2019t be an issue. They spend half of their week long trip asleep by 5pm, which is why I recommend a two week tripThe 12 hour schedule only matters on a planet with 24 hour days thoughOther planets prob. don't have 24 hour days. Heck even if you flew to the arctic right now you'd have days of nightThat\u2019s why I have a theory that\u2019s how we should work on the universal clock. Like it\u2019s a weird concept to think about at first, but maybe I would sleep at nighttime between 1p-10p and somewhere else night would be 2a-10a. \n\nMy theory wouldn\u2019t get rid of the sleep issue, but it would get rid of the confusing \u201cwhat time is it?\u201d Bc we would be on universal or GMT time or whatever.Just land in the right time zone.\n\nProblem solved.That's a pretty hefty assumption. Even in our own solar system day length vary from 10 hours to over 5,000 (Venus).The real jet lag comes in when you land on a planet with a 75 hour day, and a 108 hour night.Unless the planet has longer daysOP needs to get back in the shower and re-think thisWere assuming earth time. On other planets once \u201cday\u201d could be dozens of earth days. Were also assuming youre a human from earth. Who knows how you could have developed being from somewhere where one day cycle is 1000 hoursTrue, but it makes no sense to assume that, since all planets spin at different ratesFair point!  Now that leads to the question of wtf do Star Wars time zones look like.I think the bigger issue is the length of a day being different across planetsI think the trouble there is what if your intended landing zone isn't synced up with the time you want? Like, we've arrived at Naboo's capital, but it's midnight local time and morning for our bodies. Can't really fix it at that point.This man space travelsThat's because no one actually sleeps in the Star Wars universe unless it's a trap for somebody or otherwise important to the plot.Republican Senators typically live on Coruscant and attending the Senate is their full time job, so the schedule isn't a big problem. For Jedi on campaign then they're basically soldiers, and getting used to absurd bullshit hours is one of the first things a soldier has to learn.Probably because Qui Gon was dead before the Clone wars started.  But in all seriousness it was probably arranged before entering the system to meditate or sleep.  But I think the bigger part of it is that time is viewed differently in Star Wars than our view of time being scheduled down to the second.And our sleep cycles are only a result of earth\u2019s rotation speed (length of a day). So this creates an interesting scenarioThe Expanse writers deal with this really well, explicitly noting the problems with planets with different rotation periods, for instance those which are much shorter than Earth's - and how those really mess with people.I think the have a standard galactic rotation or something like that.Wrong franchiseThat's how the Daemons get ya, idleness leads to heresy!If anything, it would be worse I'd think.Well, time dilatation is a different kind of jetlag I guess\"I sure as shit hope Yoda is on the day-side of the planet....\"But each planet has a different rotation speed so different day lengthsIf anything ships with substantial crews and service industry locations would probably be happy to have a reason to establish round the clock duty cyclesThat makes it even worse.For the travelers sure, but time speeds up in the rest of the universe relative to the space shippers.You want to go home and rethink your life.Anakin was shown sleeping a couple of times.~~Something really dumb got erased here.~~Well, when the movie with a galaxy threatening war takes place in a span of 12 hours, I guess they all happily fall asleep as soon as the big bad is defeated and the cameras are off /sNot a coincidence at all - the earth has a 24 hr cycle and then animals have evolved to adapt to itI like how you say this as if the Star Wars universe has ever been about consistency.How does it not work the way it was used in the previous 7 movies?I feel like people trying to logically explain Star Wars still don't get the point of it...it's a fucking fairytale involving spaceships, not SciFi, I don't know how that's not obvious to everyoneWow, Star Wars fans really do hold petty grudges.How do planets on the other side of the galaxy many lightyears away keep track of that time? Sure, ships might have the hyperplane, but light and information still takes normal speed to get thereBut is it ever explicitly mentioned its in our universe? No afaik.\n\nSo the whole \"far away galaxy\" might refer to a completely different universe in our multiverse.So you're telling me that the people with the FASTEST ships have the SHORTEST trips? Tell me more.And flip-flopped on Newtonian physics worse than most other movies including the original trilogy and the prequels (i.e. the Holdo maneuver where she Lightspeeded the resistance ship through Snoke's ship using magical non-existing inertia)Well, they never sleep in the series. Or eat. (Except Jabba.)Was watching the clone wars today and it just popped in my head!Planets do.I heard Kylo Ren is the son of a boomer. Also that he\u2019s totally ripped.Whoa how did you get to be so cool?Nobody askedThat\u2019s exactly where this shower thought is coming from. They have to travel between planets and different parts of the planets meaning they have to adjust to the timezone of that part of the planet. This isn\u2019t something only you know.the physics made sense?\n\nin Star Wars?I mean. Even in the world of Star Wars they are refered to as humans by name.Thanks. I thought so too.You realize that\u2019s what this sub is right?If they\u2019re twin engines then they cancel eachother outTIE fighters don't have self-contained hyper-drives like X-wings do.  So the Ion engines aren't related to the kind of lag being talked about here.  It'd be hyper-lag.\n\nSolution though:  Land on whatever part of the planet matches your clock.Ion engines are still thrusters. Warp engines are not. One moves the ship and the other moves space.Tell that to Boba FettThey fly now?I gotta get me one of thoseYou should have more respect to call the Rising Phoenix by it\u2019s proper title.That's me with China, exactly 12 hours. I typically have little jetlag going. It's the return that kills me. \n\nWhen I go arrive at night. Sleep poorly night 1, but work all the next day, hit the hotel exhausted and fall asleep on a normal schedule. I lock in quickly. \n\nComing home I end up sleeping in the basement for a week so I don't keep my wife up with my insomnia.I used to go to India quite a bit and I had the opposite problem. Could not sleep more than a couple of hours each night while I was there, then I'd crash so hard when I got back to the states. It was all I could do to grind through work and go to bed at 19:00 for the first week home.The trick is just have an awful sleep schedule all the timeI had zero jet lag going between asia and the states back when I was in the army. If I was landing in the morning I would stay up the previous night so I could sleep on the plane, and if I was landing at night I'd stay up on the plane instead. Basically, just stay up 24 hrs before the trip. Easier to stay up than try to fix sleep after the fact.Yeah  I think generally around two weeks is like the perfect amount of time for \"cultural\" vacations. It gives you enough time to get acclimated not only to the time zone, but also I find you tend to get a much deeper experience of what it's like to live somewhere. In a week (especially if you're going multiple places) you don't get to forge friendships or experience much day-to-day stuff.I find -10 to -12 hour jetlag a lot easier to adjust than +5 to +6 personally. My last trip to Singapore I felt like I adjusted in 2-3 days, but whenever I go to Europe from the east coast US I feel groggy and weird for an entire week or more. Making the body fully out of sync versus ever so slightly out of sync might make it easier to adjust faster (plus, it's easier for me to just stay up longer or wake up later than to attempt to go to sleep early / wake up early).Depends. People like myself who regularly work shift work can deal with jetlag easily.the sun rising at 4am doesn't helpMaybe its an age thing, but went on a Japan trip back in high school and since I stayed up the entire flight i pretty had no jetlag since I just crashed when I got to the hotelI don't think it will be a problem for me. If I don't actively try to go to sleep, I can stay up until 4-5 in the morning no problem. I can do 7-8 if you give me a soda or some candy. My body hates my time zone.I never crash early from jet lag but I'm always up wicked early. Works out well. I get more time to do things in new placesI always find the arrival jet lag isn\u2019t the problem since you\u2019re excited when travelling. Getting back to come work is a BITCHMy roommate went to Japan a few years ago and he spent the 2 weeks before he left slowly adjusting his body clock so it would be in line with the time zone he was traveling to. He said it worked perfectly but was definitely a hassle.When I went to Japan I was 16 so I just didn't sleep much for the first week. Ah to be young.Okay Mr. MoneybagsCan you recommend a good Japan vacation?That's weird, I've been to Japan twice now and experienced no jet lag whatsoever both times.It never occurred to me until now, but as a night-shift goblin I should really look into vacationing in Asia/Australia for jet-lag free travel.I went to Japan for a week (from the US) a few years ago and had zero jet lag. Also didn\u2019t have any on a trip to Morocco this year. My usual plan is to sleep as much as possible on the plane, and then after landing, no matter what time it is, stay awake and active until local bedtime and then lie down until morning. Even if I can\u2019t sleep and end up reading a book or something, it seems to kinda force my biological clock to the local time pretty easily.As difficult as it is, I find the trick is to stay up as late as possible and try to get to bed at a normal time. Earlier this year I flew from the East Coast to Vietnam, 23 hours without any sleep and I was wiped. I landed at around 9pm and got to my friend's house around 10. Once there and despite my exhaustion, I forced my self to stay up until my normal bed time of 1 am. Woke up the next day at 8am and had a perfectly normal schedule.Or just stay awake until your flight that lands in Japan in the morning and sleep on the plane. It's what I do and don't miss a beat.We're going to Australia next year, so this is good to know. I also work nights,  so that should help a little.I did California to london 3 times. I'd sleep on the plane a bit then force myself awake till 9pm their time then sleep. Not as drastic but it worked. Helped the flights were at night cali time.\n\nComing back was a trip tho. I'd wake up at like 5am.\n\nI spent like 4 months in Italy for work weeks at a time coming back. It's the going there that was hard. Coming home was easy.\n\nI always wonder how europeans coming to the states are. It must be easy to come here but shit going back. I'm not sure what's betterIm going in a week but the first week is to ski so being asleep at 5pm doesn't sound that bad.If you start adjusting your time a day or two in advance and either sleep or force yourself to stay awake on the plane (depending on what time you land) you can mitigate the effect pretty well. But it still works best for people who make the trip pretty often, and dont have hard set sleep routines.For real, the flight/time change from Florida to Hong Kong is  brutal.Good thing I'm an insomniac and my brain doesn't start properly functioning till like 5 - 6 PM.I dont know about others, but growing up with experiencing jet lag constantly, especially between Korea and the US, I just kinda got used to it. It's gotten to the point where I can plan it out to where I dont really feel any lag anymore. Last time I went to Europe, I was able to be on the new schedule almost immediately.\n\nIf you dont know it, and plan, it will be a bitch to deal with though.That depends on the person. I'm in Japan for three weeks and the time zone difference is +14 hours. We only fell asleep by 6pm once.The two times I went, I was up from 7am till 1am. Didn't run into any issues until I got home and slept for 12 hours.Yep. Been to China twice. The first couple days I am passed out by 7 pm and then wake up at like midnight. Then you get to do it all over again a couple of weeks later.I guess perks of working night shift is that I would never experience it lolI lived on base in Japan specifically Okinawa jet lag honestly wasn\u2019t a thing.It's not an issue for me. Solution is easy:  go to the duty free liquor store, buy a bottle, drink as much as you can without putting yourself in danger, (sadly) toss the rest, get on the plane, and enjoy passing out for 6 hours regardless of the time.  It's a $30 investment, but if you're traveling to Japan from America you can probably afford it. Works best at 3pm EST.If you don't eat for 12-14 hours the next time you eat your body sets as \"breakfast time\". It takes about a day to sink in, and you should try to stick with a normal day's schedule in the new timezone for that day anyways, but it actually works.\n\nHere's the actual study https://science.sciencemag.org/content/320/5879/1074\n\nAnd here's a Forbes article explaining it for us mortals who don't aren't Harvard biologists doing research for the Beth Deaconess Medical Center https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2016/11/28/how-to-beat-jet-lag/amp/> They spend half of their week long trip asleep by 5pm\n\nlol fuckin rookies blast some lines and you'll make it to a normal bedtimeIn the past I often did trips with 10h jet lag.\n\nDoing it westward is annoying, doing it eastward is just shitty.I think one of the best ways to do vacations is to book a flight so you'll arrive at the country in the evening or late afternoon. Check in your bags at the hotel or drop your bags off in the Airbnb, go out for dinner, then come back and SLEEP! It's never failed my family yet.I find going between the East coast of the USA to Europe much harder than US to Japan or Australia. Coming back from Europe is much easier for some reason.I find that if you plan your flight such that you get there at night flying in a plane is exhausting and you don\u2019t get much actual sleep so when you get in you are exhausted and sleep and then wake up in the morning refreshed. The same trip I learned this the flight home we got in pretty early in the morning and adjusting was really hard.> They spend half of their week long trip asleep by 5pm\n\nNice, nothing would change for me.I always sleep until 4pm-6pm and don\u2019t go to bed until 6am, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be fine. lolMeh. It depends on the person. I would fly to Guam from the eastern United States and maybe only ruin my first day with sleep. Otherwise I just slid into the right schedule with ease.I've been on a trip to Taiwan and a trip to Singapore, and I never got jet lagged to or from. For about a week after returning home fro. Taiwan I would sleep until 10am when normally I sleep until 8, but that was it.There are ways to prepare yourself for it, and every time I've gone to Japan from the US I've never lost an entire week of passing out by 5pm. Some ways are better than others but I always just make sure that before I take off I figure out what time it is at my destination and if I should be sleeping during the flight I try and sleep during the flight, or part of it, and sometimes assisted by mild drugs. At any rate the main goal is that whenever I land I try and stay up until a normal bedtime and then pass out. Done that way I usually am tired but no more than I am when I stay up too late one evening. The only time this bit me in the ass was when I went from the US, to Japan, to London, then back to the US within the span of about 10 days. Too many of those nights of a lack of sleep combined with the exhaustion of that much work got me sick by the time I got back home (not to mention the 40 some odd hours spent on a petri dish of a plane).My sleep schedule is already fucked, so if I visited Japan for a week I would probably be jet lagged back to a normal person sleep schedule.See, I have never had a problem with Jet Lag going to Japan. I usually touch down at 4PM or so, Hotel by 6, get dinner and walk around for a bit, and in bed by 8 or 8:30 the first night. Then by Full Day #1, I'm good to go. I've been over a handful of times, never been an issue at all.\n\nComing *back*, though. Coming back *destroys me*. I sleep in random, nonsensical 4 hours bursts for like a week.Vancouver to Australia direct is great because the flight is a bit before midnight, takes 14 hours, and you land at breakfast. So you just kinda drift in and out of sleep, you kinda just get enough over the 14 hours and you can get on with your first day.\n\nComing back is the dead opposite (obviously) in that you leave in the morning around 10am, takes 14 hours, and you go backwards a few hours in time landing around 7am. So you can't sleep on the plane because you've just woken up, but when you get back to Vancouver at 7am you can't sleep for another 12 hours else you'll screw up for work the next day.There is online scheduler for get rid of jetlag in fee days.Really? I never experience jet lag heading west to Asia. It's always heading back east at the end of my trip that kills me.Idk, I didnt feel jet lagged at all going to Japan, actually, I had a problem not going to sleep early enough and waking up way too earlyOTOH visiting the US from Japan for two weeks actually improves my sleeping habits for a while when I go back to Japan.I flew to Ireland from Toronto yesterday. After a 3 hour train in Ireland and not a lot of sleep on the overnight flight, a few drinks had me ready for bed by 8pm. Managed to battle until 11pm and woke by 7am this morning, I think I\u2019ll be mostly through it now!Easy fix, insomnia and caffeineWhat if I fuck up my sleep schedule leading up to the trip and then hit the ground running?Would a three week vacation be the best for japanNever had an issue with jet lag myself, travelling from UK you normally have a super early flight so I just sleep most of the flight. Will be tired but stay up till around 9pm then go to bed.\n\nNot sure how it'd work for this in US etc.Protip. Work a job where the hours always change so you don't have a set sleep schedule. Then when you travel you don't get jet lag.yeah I've gone between Australia and Canada a few times. To combat the jetlag, I either sleep as much as I can on the flight, arrive sometime around midnight and just try to sleep right away. My schedule will match up after like 2 days\n\nAlternatively if you can't sleep, just stay awake as long as you can, and when the night comes then finally get some rest.Hard to blame them though. As much as I know how it works, if you haven't experienced it.... it's hard to process how you'll respondI was working nights when we took our honeymoon to japan. I HATED nights, but it was huge for our trip to have one of us preadjusted and able to steer the ship while my wife got caught up.Didn\u2019t happen there for me. In Japan was totally fine. But back at the states i slept a day. Screwed my self by sleeping in the first day back.  If I avoided that as planned I\u2019d have been okI find the 12 hour jet lag easy compared to other times. The trick is to not sleep on the plane (awake ~24-36hours) and time the flight so it gets in 6pm. Then pass out as soon as you get to the hotel. You wake up 14 hours later and you're back on track.I flew back from Japan on a flight to San Francisco and I remember landing around the time we took off on the same day. That messed me up for a minute.That's why we keep ourselves on Centurian time.If we were to put ourselves on Centurian time, it wouldn't be so bad...  It's a 37-hour day.Here's a fairly amusing article about why this would be a terrible idea: https://qntm.org/abolishThey have a universal time called ZULU time (UTC) unfortunately only aviation and military use it currentlyThe problem with this is that whenever you wanted to contact someone internationally, you would have to figure out \"which time is morning for them\" rather than \"what time is it in their zone.\" Whether you have a universal time or time zones, wherever you're dealing with a comparison between two different places you're going to have to do some math to convert.Dude, I have been advocating for this for years. It makes perfect sense to me. It\u2019s the same time everywhere on the planet and we switch to the 24-hour clock (no more AM and PM).  It would not be difficult at all to determine what your hours of being awake and sleeping are, relative to what time you have daylight and nighttime.[deleted]I'm totally on board with this, so long as it's daylight in my region from 7 AM to 5 PM, and it's all the other regions that have to adjust to the sunlight not matching their expectation for the time.this already exists and it's called UTC. google the timezone you're currently in and add \"utc offset\" and you'll get a negative number if you're in the western hemisphere and a positive number if you're in the eastern hemisphere.Yeah, but then you would have to keep in mind at what hours do people around the world sleep.But humans have a natural sleep cycle and it would have bad effects on the people who have to sleep during the day and wake up at night\nPlus they wouldn\u2019t get enough sunlight\nEdit: I realized my mistake in the next comment so just read that instead of pointing out I was wrongEh... think about a simple scenario of shopping hours between 8 and 5. Where you live that might become let\u2019s say... 1200 to 2000... then you go somewhere else and it\u2019s completely different.\n\nBecause our times are relative to daylight... morning is morning everywhere. 7am where ever you are is when daylight happens and people get going (generally). With universal time it would be a nightmare. West cost daylight is 8am. East coast daylight is 11am. Daylight in the UK is 1600, Eastern Europe 2000 etc. \n\nJust doesn\u2019t make sense unless you need to coordinate across time zones very very frequently... airlines and military for example. And even in the military it\u2019s rarely seen. I\u2019ve yet to need to use It.I imagine they're mapped on a planet-to-planet basis, and that there's most likely a universal time for use in space and arranging interplanetary communication.\n\nSo if I live on Yavin 4 and I want to invite my friend from Tatooine to a party, I'd put the universal time on my invite so that they can be prepared to not only arrive on time, but also adjust their sleeping if necessary.\n\n^((edit: Yavin not Yarvin, lol))  \n^((edit 2: It's Yavin 4, dummy))Apparently there is a [Galactic Standard Calendar ](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Standard_Calendar) which also defines time based on the size and rotation of Coruscant. How time zones between systems figure into this is a whole other question I suppose.To be able to enjoy a scifi universe like star wars, you have to just ignore the more technical questions. Just hearing the words \"time dilation\" is enough to just be skeptical about everything in the movies.They don't have themBut each planet would have days of different length. Even if you landed in the same \"time zone\" it would feel offSame as earth but now you add plenty into the mix\n\nMain time: Coruscant Time\n\nSecondary time: Plant time\n\nThird (Tertiary?) time: Within planet timezonesYeah, someone's birthday might only last a few hours on one planet, but span a whole week on another.\n\nAnd what about age? Age years also always in relation to Coruscant's rotation? Was Yoda 900 \"Coruscant years\" or 900 of his birthplanet's years?I just assume that Star Wars planets are completely homogenous and thus it doesn't matter where you land. You know, desert planet, Trantor planet, ice planet, jungle planet...[deleted]Not necessarily,  look at the research of sleep cycles of spelunkers.It also talks about them putting the Roci on a day/night cycle and changing during the voyage to adjust prior to arrival.The scientific writers on The Expanse do it so much better than almost every other production, so many little details that are actually quite relevant they get right (and only once in awhile does the director not quite understand and apply an artistic interpretation)... I'm been binging on the show lately and almost caught up, love it.Exactly \n\nStandard Galactic Time or something like that, it's based off of Corasaunt (spelling bad yeah yeah) timeHyper lagOops. I was thinking of Monty PythonEverything interesting on a Star Wars planet is conveniently within an hour's drive or soOmg you are right lol.yeah so if you were to travel 1 ly away and then back, it might be instant for you, but 2 years will pass for everyone else. I guess thats the problem with space is that the distances are so massive relative to our life spans, measuring distances in years travelling at a speed matter can't reach.I.... wanna go home and re think my lifeShe most certainly was not. She was recording her \"help me Obi-wan Kenobi\" bit on R2.I assume they\u2019re talking about that part in TLJ where Holdo rams into a ship at lightspeed, which brings up the question of why couldn\u2019t they do that for the death-starThat's literally the plot of the entire movie\nThe first order can track people through hyperspace \nI don't blame you for not remembering, it was a shit plotIt\u2019s not really that petty - there are major plot points in previous movies based around how hyperspace and battles work. Then it just all gets chucked out. Ignoring your universe\u2019s rules isn\u2019t creative, it\u2019s lazy.Of all the things people get upset about in episode 8, the light speed thing is something I\u2019ll never understand. It was fucking bad ass. I don\u2019t get the complaints about it.Seriously, I just watched them all again and I think the only one that\u2019s fair to rip on is attack of the clones. Boring love story, awful CGI. There are still great moments but god damn is it rough.Rian Johnson actually has talent for non-Star Wars movies though (e.g. knives out)Yes changing the rules of an established sci fi universe tends to do thatBig brain time.\ud83c\udfc5pure gold, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have one to give.Great minds think alike.Im not cool bro, im working when everyones partying and im living my life when everyones asleep or at work.Too bad i gave an answerMaybe, they just sleep when they get sleepy and say fuck itBasd on the on Expanded Universe Universe hyperspace travel was a ship traveling outside of real space so they could travel faster than light. Hyperdrive engines used massive amounts of energy to basically transport ships into subspace.  \n\nWhile a ship was outsideof real space, they were in communication blackout. Also a convoy of ships were each inside their own pocket of subspace while traveling.  \n\nBecause of the danger of gravity wells interfering with hyperdrive engines,  most travel was confined to specific corridors that were free of anomalies. \n\n\nBecause gravity is a constant force in real and hyperspace, stars, planets, and black holes would cause Hyperdrive engines to fail or explode. They were designed with safety cutoffs to drop ships out of hyperspace when an unknown gravity anomaly was in their path. \n\nIn the old EU books, the Empire had special Gravity Emitters on certain Star Destroyers that were used to pull ships from Hyperspace and keep them from jumping back into Hyperspace.  This was used to fight pirates and also to catch Rebels. \n\nThere was no way to use a ships Hyperdrive to bypass a planetary shield, because the planetary gravity would cause Hyperdrive engines to automatically drop you out before damage. Also, if you removed that safety system from the Hyperspace Drive,  the ship would explode before it made it into the upper atmosphere. \n\n\nThat's just a small amount of the from TFA that was changed. Also, the entire Starkiller base would be destroyed after one firing of the stupid gun. Plus, you can't shoot blasters through hyperspace, the death star needed to physically be moved from place to place. A fixed gun emplacement is moronic as a terror weapon. \n\nIf you want to know about how the old system worked, read the X-wing series.So is your mom but we all know she's an animal raawwwaarrrr.Ion know man, but I think you still get jet lagOnly if one is ion and one is ioffThis is the most logical comment thread on all of RedditDad with twins, it's actually just exponentially more exhaustion with twinsWell in my U-Wing I have 4 engines so what does that mean?You're thinking of the twin paradox, which only applies to special relativity.  But Star Wars uses Hyperspace which is outside of those laws.big brain mode activatedIdentical or fraternal?Yeah stoopid!then how did they lightspeed skip to chase the millennium falcon?Planet has 50 hour days... what do now?...and Jango.Boba Fett?! Where?!?!They fly now!Try taking 2-3mg melatonin on the first night at the time you want to go to sleep. It has worked wonders for me, feels like it completely resets my sleep scheduleI fly from Australia to Africa for work every 2 months and I find the same thing! \n\nFlying west, never a problem. Flying east? 5 days to recover. \n\nBeing exhausted at 4 in the afternoon and then not being able to sleep at 2am.[deleted]I used to travel to Europe from the Western US regularly. That was bad enough. I can't imagine more than that.\n\nMy job was training surgeons on surgical equipment. Doing at, through an interpreter, at 4 in the morning (my time) was one of the most brutal things I ever did.Agreed. As someone who is always tired anyway,     jet lag's got nothing on me.Dunno if you're being funny or not, but this is legit advice. If I'm ever traveling somewhere with a noticeable timezone difference (3+hrs for me), I make sure I either don't sleep or have terrible sleep the night before and force myself to not sleep until the \"appropriate\" time at my destination.\n\nI haven't had jet lag since I was 14, even when I fly back to the UK from the USA. Though it helps that I usually only get 5hrs of sleep anyway.After working a swing shift I think I could do alright.>The trick is ~~just have an awful sleep schedule all the time~~ booze.This is definitely the way to do it. Hit the ground running as soon as you land and stay busy the first day until it\u2019s at least a couple hours after dark. Also drink yourself to sleep the first night. Zero lag from that point on.This and alcohol is the way. It's like time travel. For Europeans (and me) two weeks is a short vacation. One month is more of a worthy trip to remember a country.In Okinawa the sun sets at 6pm, in Tokyo it\u2019s 4pm. Japan has nationally standard time, so there aren\u2019t multiple time zones. If you\u2019re in Tokyo, it really messes with you circadian rhythms[deleted][deleted]The argument about what a day of the week means in terms of regulations is compelling, but I don't think the rest of the article is.\n\n\"Is someone awake at 4am in Australia?\" Well, they're nine 24ths behind us, and I get up at 10pm every day, so they probably won't be awake for another 3 hours.\n\nIt's basically the same as right now, except you compare to 10pm vs everyone comparing to 9am. You only ever need to compare to yourself, so there's only one waking time anyone needs to know for themselves.\n\nThe argument around centering around solar noon is bunk. Any municipality could do that right now if they wanted to and it would be equally confusing as in a timezone-less world.That was interesting, and the user comments fascinating. A lot of things they suggested seem totally silly (eg: widen the time zones and have only four total zones!), and the most bizarre was a reversal in thinking regarding time, in which everyone had the same time, but time zones exist with an offset. \n\nSo now we have to memorize when the different zones are awake based on +/- offsets, rather than using a known 8-5 schedule. It's probably easier to ask Google for the current time of the location you're calling vs asking Google if people are probably awake (maybe ask how many hours until/since the sun rises/has risen?).  \n\nThe benefit to that system would be scheduling; someone sets a meeting for 21:00, and everyone can add the meeting to their calendars without time conversion. But it exchanges the same amount of inconvenience to use that system.That gave me some flashbacks to working night shift (9pm - 7am) and  not knowing what day anyone referred to when they said \"today\" and making up fake names for the joint days (like they use Wednesday/Thursday in the article)\n\noofThat\u2019s what I was thinking. I knew it wasn\u2019t something that would have to be created, rather just a switch over to common use.And computers. Most computer time is UTC with a calculated offsetI mean, the only reason *to* use it is if you're in aviation or the military. Why would you subject yourself to that if you weren't? For the off chance convenience of some international traveler you'll likely never meet? Why?\n\nNo thanks. We already adjust noon up to an hour either way, that seems plenty to me.The civil aviation world already does this, based on GMT. They need to have a unified system because of planes constantly switching time zones. \n\nBut America won\u2019t switch to the metric system? You really think it\u2019s going to switch to this?Seems confusing at first, but I guess it\u2019s no different than me (an American) trying to wrap my head around January being summer for Australiathat is a much worse system for every scenario except someone who changes timezones or needs to schedule across timezones which is a minuscule fraction of the population. most people dont need to reconcile different timezones more than a few times a year if that, when they travel across them. but with the internet people frequently speak to people in other timezones in a way that doesnt requre current reconciliation but might rely or normalization ie, oh its 2 am here so i should go to bed. right now 2 am is 2 am for everyone within their own scale. swithcing to singular time you need to know where someone is to know if 2 am is past your bedtime or time for an afternoon snack. you still have timezones and for most people you need to do a lot more calculation. and thats just on the internet. do you republish every book differently for each time zone? do you edit every movie to show the timezone adjusted numbers on a clock so the audience doesnt wonder whay someone is having lunch in daylight at 2am?Scheduling meetings based on a common time would be fantastic but remembering whether people are working or not based on where they are would be a nightmare.Way easier to code programs for too, I know a lot of people would be happy about thatAs a programmer I could not be more on board with this.\n\nTime zones, and daylight savings more so, cause sooooo many problems.That would fuck human health massively.\n\nEDIT: I read your comment in a hurry and misunderstood that you wanted everyone around the planet to be on the same schedule.\n\nWhat you propose actually exists - it is the coordinated universal time. It is convenient for computing, but for humans it is the local solar time that matters.I'm pretty sure that everyone who suggests this idea subconsciously thinks that is how it's going to work. As soon as you give it any serious thought you realize how terrible the idea is.I think they are saying we would all use the same time on our clocks but you would still do things on a regular day/night schedule. So you would sleep when it's dark out but the clock might say it's 10am when you go to bed.No... you don\u2019t sleep during the daytime. Copied from my last comment: \n\nIt\u2019s the same time everywhere on the planet and we switch to the 24-hour clock (no more AM and PM).  It would not be difficult at all to determine what your hours of being awake and sleeping are, relative to what time you have daylight and nighttime. \n\nFor example, if we were using UTC as our time of record, I would be going to sleep at approximately 07:00 and waking up at 14:00. I would start work at 16:00 and be done at 00:00. Dinner would be at maybe 02:00. And the times for someone who lives on the Prime Meridian would be more what we currently think of as \u201cstandard\u201d times.Ah yes, Yarrrrrvin. Planet of pirates.Of course all of this assumes that time dilation doesn't exist is the galaxy far far away. There's really no way to have a standard universal time and faster than light travel in the same universe.\n\nBut most of star wars assumes no time dilation, so that's nothing new. Honestly it's best to try not to apply too much logic to start wars if you can help it.My time has come: So the main mega city planet  in the galaxy that Star Wars takes place in is called Coruscant. It's a political behemoth holding the Jedi temple. Every planet obviously has its own day and night cycle but all run on Coruscant time. Kinda how different banks/law firms in the US have clocks for their own time zone and for NY's or DC's.\n\nTLDR; Yes, all planets have their own daylight cycle but  business and other meetings/ important events run on Coruscant (Central planet of the Star Wars universe) timeThat is the coolest shitIf you live on a gas giant then you are braver than I. I think you mean the 4th moon of yavin, as the main planet is just gas.Halfway between sunrise and sunset is noon, and go from there.\n\nNow how they figure out time zones [on Tatooine](https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Star-Wars-Tatooine-sunset.jpg) is a real head-scratcherTheir light speed travels as fast as the plot needs them to.They were centipedes tho.Turns out Palp was running a pyramid scheme of assassins to pay for the death star.Or how Anakin woke up from his nightmare in his bed next to Padme.\"I mean yeah, when you say it out loud like that it sounds overly complicated...\" -SheevLike Dooku himself couldnt have just rolled up in a speeder, force chocked her from outside the window, then hit the gas and peacedSpelunkers took part in the same evolution that all the other humans did on earth. At least that was the logic I was going off ofThe books are even more detailed.Butchered it: CoruscantYepAh fuck. Well, anyway, she was sleeping in the death star at one point...Merry suggested it to Poe, but Poe handwaved it, calling it a one in a million shot.It also brings up the question of why everything inside a starship doesn't get crushed and liquified every time a ship goes to hyperspace.They track through hyperspace in the other movies it just required a beacon before, what\u2019s so bad about this new tech?It's something going the speed of light colliding against something else.If hyperspace jumps are so destructive, the entire death star plot becomes pointless.\n\nWhy does Luke need to use the force to hit the vent, just yeet a couple ships at it from lightyears away.\n\nIn fact, why even build a death star. Put a hyperspace drive on a decent sized rock and obliterate any planet you want.Neat.yeah but that's the thing, it was always the expanded universe that came and retkonned all of the Mish mashed of the films.\n\nyou just prooved it once more. the physics in Star wars just isn't working. is it important? not really, it's  a fantasy in space. does the sequel destroy the physics? it never made sense except if you read the expanded universe.It could be double, cus they\u2019re twinsUnderrated comment right hereSomething something ionic bonds?Yes, no jets fly in spacePeople are parallel to engines in their requirements, in addition to intersecting them, because people also require fuel to imagine shit like engines, and engines...

For me flying to the USA from UK. is like a 2 day max of real bad lag, and that's if I manage it poorly. Coming home is a week of hell.\n\nOddly this held true even when I went to Hawaii. Though my Hawaii recovery was actually fairly quick due to a very very strict sleep schedule on the day before, and during the return flights.\n\nJet lag can be managed, but difficult to defeat.In country it's no big deal, you really don't even notice it. You just say oh it gets dark earlier here, or whatever.I'm not OP but since Beijing time was the one Mao moved the whole country to, that means the other tier 1 cities (Shenzhen and Shanghai) are all close enough laterally to Beijing to also be on the \"right\" time. So unless you're visiting cities further in the west, you won't notice it much.\n\nAs I understand it, the time being offset from what would make sense is mostly just a quirk until you go to the extreme west of Xinjiang where Beijing Standard Time is sometimes ignoredI\u2019ve done trips to Japan, India and Europe from the Western US.  Europe is the worst jet lag in my experience.Intuitive?Lol, I was reading this whole thread trying to absorb some info and then I get to your comment. Oh yeah, my brain doesnt give half a fuck what time it is or when we last got some sleep. \n\nLet's just keep it going till I physically cant keep my eyes open, then we can rest for 20hrs.Your jetlag advice is pretty accurate, but getting 5 hours of sleep regularly is super unhealthy, you should work on that if possible.[deleted](Points to him) Zed right...\n.You generally get to know what time peoples shifts are on, I can see what time the americans get onto work via skype as well.*Really* most computer time is calculated as the number of seconds that've passed since midnight on jan 1st, 1970Listen now... big difference between advocating for something and actually thinking it\u2019s realistic.and we were sooo close in the 80s!It makes so much more sense than our current way of doing things... after the initial shock of unlearning what we\u2019ve been taught.Do we define a season by the climate or calendar? I always just thought Australia had sweltering winters and freezing summers. Then again, I live in Florida where we only have two seasons, either wet or dry, so I'm used to defining seasons by calendar since there's less weather variation here.Word. Me included.Dealing with timezones in programming is not hard. You store all times as unix timestamps and use a timezone library to convert to a display time. If you're trying to roll your own timezone library you're an idiot.\n\nAnd yes I do this frequently, in my job we have people working in three different timezones and the corporate headquarters uses a fourth. So we do a lot of timezone conversions, and they're very easy.No kidding. Daylight savings completely fucks up all of my automated jobs twice a year.How? You still sleep during the dark and are awake during the sunlight... your clock just has different numbers than you are currently used to.Oooh, my bad, I guess that makes more sense thenExactly!I overcompensated for my accent... I'm from MA so if I have to spell something like Yavin I assume I'm dropping an 'r' when I say it in my head.[deleted]Yeah, star wars is space fantasy, not sci fi.\n>Honestly it's best to try not to apply too much logic to start wars if you can help it.\n\nMost wars aren't started because of logic, so this works out.[removed][deleted]^actually /sHis nightmare was the Force punishing him for sleeping.There\u2019s some research that suggests that, without something to keep us in line, humans will tend towards a (edit: it was 26) ~~36 (might have been 30?)~~ hour cycle or so.  It\u2019s still about 1/3 sleep, 2/3 wake, but it\u2019s more efficient to sleep for a bit longer and then work for a decent chunk longer.  It ends up being about an extra 4 hours sleep per cycle, but an extra 8 hours work per cycle.They often go to a 48 hour ish cycleReally? I didn't even noticeTrue story.Um, because it's hyperIt's not clear that that's what's happening, or how hyperspace works in Star Wars. Star Wars is pretty far divorced from real physics - which is fine! As long as you stay consistent. \n\nBut it really didn't there. If that attack was viable in the Star Wars universe, why wasn't it employed far more often? Why not just make drone ships that hyperspace through Star Destroyers? It would be very cheap to bring down a whole fleet that way. \n\nSo why even have all these crazy space battles at all? It really cheapens so many other scenes.I don\u2019t think lightspeed can actually be the speed of light, they\u2019d spend years hopping around the galaxy.Eh. I feel like you could pick apart so many things from the movies if you really wanted to. For me, it\u2019s always been more about rule of cool. \n\nI get what you\u2019re saying though. I guess it just doesn\u2019t bother me.The amount of mish mash in the sequels is a lot more than were done with the prequels. Basically they went for what looked good and didn't follow the MCU approach when making the movies. \n\nPersonally I don't care if someone likes the new or the old. But in most science fiction universes they have a semblance of order to it. The new stuff doesn't really have that like it used to.Did you say twins? *unzips**prepare for trouble*.  \n**and make it double**Xenu flew through space in one\"I hate droids.\"[deleted]Yet the First Order never figured out that the fundamental flaw with the TIE-fighter design is that it's shit in atmosphere. This is legends material, but the X-wing is essentially a jet fighter redesigned for spaceflight, thus performs much better in atmosphere than a TIE, which is top-down designed as a starfighter.\n\nAs for the jump tracking, (again, mostly legends material) it is possible to track a hyperjump, *assuming you and your scanners can see it happen*. This is done by comparing the trajectory of the ship prior to jump (once in, no turning is possible), the known speed of the ship, and comparing that to a list of possible endpoints and hideouts. Boils down to a *lot* of data crunching mostly done by computer, unless you have someone like Thrawn who can do it in his head.\n\nAs for those TIEs in the movie...I don't know, something was definitely off about them. Considering how they tried to pack 2 movie's worth of plot into one, I wonder if there was a scene or two dropped at the storyboard phase showing these TIEs to actually be Shadow Droids, a starfighter piloted by one or more brains; no pilot inside, just a brain or two acting as pilot and gunner, hardwired into a sophisticated tracking system.They do say the first order now has the technology to track them through hyper space. They don't say how it works exactly, but if we assume that it is looking at the exit vector of the ship entering hyperspace and then just copies it. This calculation takes some amount of time though.\n\n\nSo after every skip you are making it just a little bit further away each time. Eventually you jump and skip before they are able to make the calculation of where your hyperspace will take you.Anyone that cares has seen the movie.They based their time off of the rotation Coruscant, which is identical to that of Earth\u2019s rotation.The majority of the galaxy speaks Galactic Basic (English) but each planet has their own language. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the same for time. Their is a general galactic time but each planet has their own time zones based on size, rotation speed etcYesAnd the jetpack troopers.They fly **nyyyyeeeewwww*.Shit my 10mg dose might be overdoing it.That\u2019s an incredibly interesting study. I\u2019ve definitely fallen prey to the \u201cmore is better\u201d mindset in the past and taken 3mg doses, and absolutely felt groggy the next day. I\u2019ll have to try paring down significantly when I feel like it\u2019s necessary to take some. Thanks for sharing!This is because of the extra time tax we have in Europe. Many people don't know this, so they think they have a lag of x hours, but the tax actually makes it twenty percent more. Each country uses this time differently. In the UK, for example, some of it is used to extend the queens life.Almost remarkably not so. The hardest was a bunch of Russian intensivists. I was just struggling and one of their (25-year old, fluent in three languages) staff told me \"These docs went to a Soviet medical college. They grew up in concrete buildings built by Communism. Computers are very, very foreign. Just like you.\"[deleted]Depends on the person. But generally, yesYeah, I understand. Been working on it for a couple months, where working out and quitting drinking have put me in the mood to go to bed earlier. Still not doing it as often as I should but more than I was before so it's a start.*millisecondsJan 1st, 1970 UTC, and then the offset time is displayedAnd everyone should fully go metric at the same time.  Sure, things won\u2019t run too smoothly for a little while, but it will have to work itself out... not like the entire world will fall apart, I hope.It makes zero sense once you think about it at all. How would you know what business hours were in another country? When is lunch? When do people sleep? You would have to ask someone who lives there or look it up in a chart. In the end you would have reinvented timezones, but with even less standardization because there would be no official standard for how much people should shift their schedules.And this is exactly why we haven't swapped to a universal time.\n\nPeople can't wrap their heads around going to bed at 8:00 and waking up at 15:00. \n\nIt would only take a few days to adjust, then life continues as normal.Exactly, took me a second but I think got it. For anyone else who is confused, basically the time would be the same everywhere, for example, 2am, but what you do at 2 am would be different depending on where you are. For some, 2am would be waking up and going to work, in a different part of the world it would be eating dinner. \n\nI think it\u2019s a decent idea because you would always know the time anywhere, since it\u2019s the same. But you have to have a general idea of what the entire world is doing at any specific time. When you look at a current international clock and see that it\u2019s 12am in Australia, you immediately know, \u201cAh, these guys are sleeping.\u201d If we switched to a universal clock and saw 12am, you would have to just know what people are doing at that time.Do you pahk ya cah in Yavin yahd?North Shore representing.\n\nFun fact: my younger daughter has a thing for accents and when we lived in MA she totally had a MA accent. Now we live in Bavaria and she can drop into Bayerisch at the drop of a hat.I'm sure that there would be some form of universal measurement of time. Like here on Earth we measure one day as 24 hours, and everyone agrees to that. But just because one day on Venus is 2784 hours doesn't change the fact that one hour = 60 minutes.My apologies. Your absolutely right I need to get my head in the game. Those Jedi scum are no more. I'll be waiting at r/EmpireDidNothingWrong to receive my punishment.I wonder why that isI would love to read about this, but I can't find anything anywhere. Please share a link if anyone can find. Thank youInterestingI think they jump to light speed in order to enter hyperspace. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, I'm just guessingI agree, visually, it was an impressive scene. \n\nIf the movie had been good, I don't think people would be hating on that scene as much as they do. However, there were many questionable choices about pacing, poor continuity, etc. So the hyperspace scene just becomes another piece to criticize.that's honestly so strange ,how can they have such a massive success with Marvel and it's 20+ films and yet still fail to have a coherent story with star Wars and 9 filmsTwins, BasilTwin step sistersJesus I love redditr/unexpectedsexoffenderWell#XANADU!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLi8fTlDEag&app=desktop\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wUhhONqN5AThen why did he continue jumping? And why did every jump take him to a planet. I would assume there was a shot toon of empty space options.While you could see the direction they are going there\u2019s no way to know how long they go in that direction before dropping out of hyper speed.\n\nAka film magic. Tracking device like in OT at least made more sense despite the light years it must have sent those signals. :pI think in Legends canon it\u2019s slightly shorter than Earth, in one of the Rogue Squadron novels, they remarked that coruscant had a 23 hour day.  Plus considering almost everything we know about about Star Wars either directly or indirectly relates to combat, makes sense to use a standardized timing system, especially considering that space doesn\u2019t have a timing systemThat's just lazy writing. Matt Damon made more of an effort than that and he only went to Mars.Wouldn't they, like, use a calendar for the planet they're on while just using that for dates?this is how it is in Star Trek iircThey fly now?!!And sabineSame here, if I take a 10mg dose in one tablet maybe after an hour I\u2019ll notice my brain start functioning a little less but I won\u2019t fall asleep any faster.Bruh i took 15mg because i needed to fall asleep ASAP. Now i know why i felt like a zombie the next dayOops!  I was asking if you worked for Intuitive/DaVinci. LOLThe president's enemies don't go to sleep either, boss man.[If you're going to correct someone, be right.](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16)Agreed there as well.America! \n\nWe will never surrender our superior measurement system!It\u2019s already falling apart so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem...No, I drive a landspeedah!But time dilation does change that fact, it changes the rate at which time passes. One second is a shorter period of time for someone traveling at high speed than for someone standing still.[removed]It\u2019s that damn clockIt's actually closer to 25-26 hours, the person you're replying to was close but had it wrong.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1330995/?page=1After seeing ep 9, I love episode 8 even more. Fuck JJ.God speed, AustinWe love you too <3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*unzips*Cos it gets the people going!Well, one didn't. First one was an asteroid. He also was inputting coordinates for those places, hoping the right terrain or environment would pick off the TIEs. Second, he kept jumping because.....they were tracking him. The logic of Hyperspeed tracking from TLJ states a lead ship with those capabilities can track a hyperjump. Destroying that shit simply moves the tracking job to another ship, in this case the dozen TIE fighters. Poe had to keep skipping, hoping they get taken out but the asteroid surface, fuelling fields, and that world with the giant alien.God damn it they really fucked up hyperspace didn't they? \n\n I forgot that they \"drop out\" of hyper space, where in like Halo I'm pretty sure their end destination is their only possible destination.\"That's just lazy writing.\"\n\nIs this your first experience with Star Wars?That would be incredibly confusing. At some point you gotta standardize things for everyone.Too many planets, and also for the simplicity when writing the script I guess.They do. the planet they cast of Rebels is trying to Liberate uses it's own date system that is regularly used throughout the show. Afaik there's a Galactic time based on Corsucant and planets use individual dates / times.They fly now.Are you staring at your computer screen this entire time?  Melatonin isn't the sleep drug that other drugs are, it kinda just nudges you there.  It's more \"let me help you sleep\" than \"I'm gonna knock you out\".some say he remains jet lagged to this dayIf you need to glue somethings together, use epoch-see.Maybe creating/participating in some new/pre-existing universals will be pieces to putting it back together \ud83d\ude05You buds with AH2d2?Ooh right. I want thinking about speed. That's interestingDad stop you're embarrassing me.What do you guys think of that name?Also I\u2019m not sure on this one but I imagine because you have to plot a course to the destination to avoid planets, stars, asteroids etc. That hyperspace also isn\u2019t a straight line. So unless you know the destination how would they even plot the course.Yes, they really fucked up hyperspace. Orginal and prequel trilogy establish that planets have designated entry/exit points for hyperspace lanes. Otherwise you couldn't feasibly blockade a planet, and you could just hyperspace inside the death star shield, or at least closer to it so they don't get time to prepare a defense.\n\nAlternatively, why have any kind of tactical battle when you can just autopilot some shitty freighter into a target at lightspeed.\n\nThe sequel trilogy is average as far as movies go, but the complete disregard for established rules and canon is what makes people rightfully despise them.I dunno, I thought Jar Jar was an excellent vehicle for driving senatorial procedure in a galactic legislature forward in the storyline. Wade through all that rigmarole with a sense of humor and get back to that uncomfortable love story.Eh, I don't think it'd be too complicated to have a Republic calendar and a calendar for your planet.I think you\u2019re right.of coahse! And don't fuhget Luke Skywalkah!Austin? Not a bad city name but it has it's limits.What was uncomfortable about the love story? I thought all women loved guys who constantly talked about themselves and killing children and what an asshole the reasonable guy who's in charge of them is.Imma float this pear at you because I love you, okay?Ignoring all the goofy bits with flips and glow wands, it ends up being a tight political thriller.It's like poetry, it rhymesFuckin\u2019 Dahth Vadah was a Skywalkah too!",

This is the same problem that makes people think leadership means being an asshole.In school, we were taught how to write essays with a minimum word count, how to avoid run-on sentences, gerunds and got praised for an expansive vocabulary.\n\nIn the workforce, no one can be asked to read an email that uses caveman-like English for a quicker read and is listed nicely. \n\n1.) please advise ETA\n2.) please advise unit price \n3.) please send invoice by tomorrow end of day\n\nSeriously.

Example: Man went through the Drive Thru. What happened after may shock you!\n\nHook: An enticing introduction to a paper to make you want to read the rest. Example: \"Have you ever wanted to read minds? In this series, Main Protagonist, Mindo-chan, has been both blessed and cursed with the ability to read other people's minds!\"\n\nOne is a cheap bait and click, the other is actually inticing and not misleading.It\u2019s different. A good title or opening for an essay should be an honest summary of what is coming, something like a mini-abstract. Its purpose should be to help you decide whether you need to read the rest or not.I was never taught to write 'hooks' just basically a summary of the essay as an intro.\n\nand there's a difference between the intro to an essay which you've already started reading, and the headline of a news article you haven't yet started reading.Well there\u2019s a difference between a captivating phrase that peaks your interest in the subject as opposed to borderline lies that manipulate you in to caring, but yeah I guesstbh you only learn that up to high school, the essays get significantly better from there\n\nEDIT: to elaborate, in high school, ill just take literary analysis essays for example, cuz they\u2019re pretty common, you start with a broad, uncontroversial statement about the world or society etc. that usually relates to your theme/thesis. then you narrow your focus in your intro until you get to your thesis at the end of the intro. that \u201cfun, attention grabbing hook\u201d bullshit is a thing of elementary/middle school\u201cWant to know what my favorite vacation is?  The answer will shock you!\u201dThe problem with clickbait is its failure to live up to the expectations they set.As far as I remember, the \"hook\" or the \"bang\" at the beginning of your essay must actually have supporting rationale within the essay itself. Clickbait articles often do not have this and they often are open-ended. In short, they bait you into reading something that is pointless.Point being the hook should still accurately represent the content of the essay, not imply something bizarre[Word cloud out of all the comments.](https://i.imgur.com/VCOmPJv.png)\n\nFun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. EnjoyThe hook wasn't, you won't believe paragraph 7 thoughI've come to the conclusion that education is little more than series of rooms wherein I'm told the next thing I need to do in order for someone to think I'm good enough to learn the thing afterward. Consistency is an after thought.I still remember stories my Communications teacher told us about essays. They were supposed to have something at the start to get the attention of the audience - and one fellow thought it would be a good idea to just scream \"SEX!\" as loud as he could, then calmly discuss his trip to Disneyland. Which was unrelated, and in no way involved sex, despite the opening line.15 FACTS to HELP your FAMILY\n\nFact 1:\n\nBlablablablabla buymestuff blablabla\n\nPage 1/15I was just thinking to myself.. what was it like before clickbait headlines?\n\nI remember the dawn of those pure clickbait headlines on FB, '.. you won't believe what happens next!' .. but have headlines ever been anything different to today?\n\nI googled to see if I could compare or find any discussions and came across this article which I think nails it.\n\nhttps://theoutline.com/post/4716/how-everything-on-the-internet-became-clickbait\n\n> .. the things that suck about modern media are by no means new. It\u2019s just that the internet has put all of them in one place. What\u00a0has\u00a0changed is people\u2019s attitudes towards the news media: in 1973, the General Social Survey found that 14% of Americans had \u201chardly any\u201d confidence in the press;\u00a0by 2016, that number was 50%Sure, but there\u2019s a big difference between an interesting and inviting beginning, and luring people in. \n\n\u201cThe man in Black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t believe what happens when this gunslinger catches up to the man in Black\u201dA hook is infinitely different than clickbaitA hook simply entices you to read more while clickbait does the same accept it either stretches the truth or completely lies. I don\u2019t agree with this shower thought because of the contrast between the two. Nobody gets pissed of at clickbait that meets somewhere near the truth.I always started off with, \"Paragraph 6 will moisten your panties.\"Teachers hate this 1 trickBecause our hooks where actually legit and truthfull. The headlines are just getting people to click not actually read the artical\"clickbait\" has always been a thing. Don't remember the kids in movies and stuff yelling \"extra extra...\" and a newspaper headline that was catchy?Idiotthoughts\"so barbecue sauce on my titties...\" Perf way to startIn school, we were forbidden from using first-person and second-person in writing.\n\nBut no news article is written entirely in third-person.JFK\u2019s Rise to Power, page 6 will blow your mind. -Timmy Sanders 7th gradeHow the public education system is contributing to the real worldI don\u2019t mind clickbait if the bait is actually in the storyBut who said I liked writing essays \n\n\n\n....Clickbait: The Lightsaber form that Obi-Wan was forbidden to learn.\n\nHook: There was a lightsaber that was dangerous for non Jedi Masters to learn, Vaadap.UwUprovocative != interestingYa this an apple to an orangeYes clickbait headlines are to grab the readers attention but sometimes they can be misleading with or without intent, so the reader may be baited into clicking on the article. Keep in mind reporting news and writing an essay to your professor is very different. To add on there are a lot of people who just read headlines.\n\nHooks at the beggining of essays are to serve an introduction to the essay and to grab a readers attention in context to the essay. Writers, screenwriters and storytellers also use hooks to draw in the reader.The defining trait of clickbait titles is that they are misleading.\n\nThe hook in a paper is not misleading. You've already told people in the title what the paper is about.A hook is essentially the subject line in an email too, and often contains all the info needed.  At work, it never ceases to amaze me how many people think they need to write an email essay when all the info is stated concisely in 5 words right in the damn subject line.I read all of this in a Spanish accentWith essay marking now outsourced for many schools.You can't even show originality. Be careful.Because if I'm writing an essay in fucking school, I don't have the ability to change how people see politics substantially. Even if it's a political essay, a hook is just that - a hook. Meanwhile for news, thousands are seeing it, the duty to be accurate is much greater. The title is a different story at that point, people's opinions may already be shaped by seeing that, while a hook most likely won't. People don't generally use school essay hooks to shape their world view.Before you buy....Do you know what a false comparison is?To be fair, it didn't mean we started our essays with... \"Here are 10 incredible things I did during my summer vacation. You would not BELIEVE Number 8!\"Writing classes in school are kinda useless, first thing I learned in real world writing is to avoid cliches at all costsThe hook is otherwise known as the \"nutgraf\" (at least as it was described to me at a student newspaper). It gives the audience the basic details of the story in the first paragraph (\"graf\"), while the rest of the story is told in the following grafs.\n\nThe headline is a totally different entity. That will draw the audience to start reading, but the hook will get them to continue.We\u2019re also taught in school to write at length, which is poison in professional life. Communication should be as concise as is humanly possible. My education taught me the opposite of what is effective.Clickbait headlines are basically a \"hook\" that drags you through a gallery of 20 different pages of the same article artificially separated with a dozen ads each which slow your computer down because 3 gifs, 5 videos, and 4 random images unassociated with my interests creates an unpleasant browsing experience, especially if I have to view without ad-block. And when I slog through all 20 pages of garbage at a speed so slow, a sloth with arthritis covered in tar would be faster than it, it's actually all bullshit with a manufactured headline. They just want clicks. You defeat clickbait by reading the articles and summarizing it so nobody else has to read it, if not saying \"it's bullshit\" and try to add the source to a blacklist so you never read an awful article from that site again.\n\nClickbait is the child you see with a lot of promise growing up that drops out of school to form an addiction and whatever job needs no skills or education. They appear to have a lot of promise, but the longer you study them it just looks more and more disappointing.Maybe our teachers were a bunch of unqualified shitheads?That's cause nobody listens to the teacher when they said to come up with a title after the article was written.Just start your essay with \u201cPeople often...\u201d Have written my last 15 or so (English) papers starting with thatWe're told to concisely state the thesis at the start, yes. We aren't told to lie.\n\nThese aren't the same at all.Because we want to be booked naturally. To not feel forced or coerced.misleading clickbait is annoying, any other type of clickbait is okay i guessYeah. No.\n\nYou should entice the reader with things from the article, noy straight up fabricate some shit out your ass.A good essay makes good on the hook.  Clickbait doesn't tend to deliver.Clickbait is only clickbait if there is no content/context to back it up.  There is a difference between hawking nonsense and spicing up the title of journalistic integrity.Exactly! That is what book covers are for. Also hooks anoy the shit out of me since they are so ambiguous, like \"Read more to find out.\" *In 2002 playground trying to sound cartoon villan cool*. Like just shut the fuck up and let me write this story without semi suicidal inflicting checkpoints Mrs. Rochford you fucking bitch. Also who buys books and doesnt read them? Is that a rich people thing? (I hate checkpoint shit)An ad is a hook to more hooks, to bait you along until you buy something. There\u2019s just no content following the lead-in.\n\nAds are like a full length movie comprised only of previews for other movies. It would be totally unfulfilling, just like clickbait.Yes, school teaches clickbait.A hook is like an appetizer: It gets you ready to consume the meal you already plan to consummate. A clickbait is like a pushy street vendor with a picture of a meal and a lot of small talk.Doesn't that only apply to persuasive writing?I dont want that penis enlargement pump, dont send me that clickbait.\n\nWell actually i want it.First Shower Thoughts post I've clicked on to see what's happening. Irony.Uh.. if you're teachers were any good they were teaching you to write thesis statements, not hooks.\n\nAnd a thesis statement is exactly what everyone wants in a new headline.. a succinct summary of the subject and contents/arguments to come.\n\nA \"flashy\" statement that makes it seem like an essay will contain something it doesn't is a terrible thesis statement and one no decent teacher would've rewarded.Post would have been better if it was\n\n\"you won't believe the hypocrisy of the education system!\"\n\nClick to read moreA hook is different to a click bait headline though. A click bait headline is usually one that is inaccurate or misleading rather than just just eye catching\"Wow look at hot gorl\"\n*insert Video talking about the industrial revolution*Supposed to be a hook that isnt a lieIt's not click-bait if it delivers.I hate hearing them ads all over the place its fucking boring as fuck.   I cant wait for the day that someone in power says you know what... we need to generate more revenue while fuck over youtuber for doing pointless shit that barely even support society as whole..... by force user to have a license for doing internet video for revenue purposes.... that would teach creator in how to not copy cat each other and must submit yearly to renew licenses that cost over 500 dollar per year.   so that the government can track where you live and track your internet policy.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm so sick of tired of having Click-bait titles while other channel are down to honest good information channel.   im sick of seeing Prank me bro... im sick of them saying how to like share and subscribe.... like its plastered on the website you dont need to tell me just because you want to hit that minute to minute wasting time just because you want to follow a formula.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i really miss is those cell-phone funny shit video where its just you vs the world and capturing the moment and not Hey im a-part of 500 people who will tell you how to feel about X topic or how the world will end.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why i like reddit better. clear cut content no ads and no like share and down right chill... with people not screaming into the microphones .Clickbait isn\u2019t that kind of literary hook.Check out my hook while DJ revolves itBottom line up front is very different from bullshit clickbait.How is this at the top of the sub? Hooks on essays capture the reader\u2019s attention and clickbait titles capture the reader\u2019s attention. That\u2019s basically all it\u2019s saying. This sub is getting so stupidNopeSimple, those kids grew up.Or a life story before a recipe.Absolutely yes i wouldNot sure if anyone brought it up yet or not, but in school they also require you to have some sort of thesis or argument in every paper. You can't simply write an informative paper that just gives information with no analysis or personal bias. So what do we get in the news? Slanted opinion pieces.The thing is a hook is a hook. A clickbait consists of hook and bait.Well hooks are relative to the actual topic as opposed to clickbait which has one or two strandsI wasn't taught that, strangeAnd people who took math class use math..I was absolutely not taught this and it sounds like pretty bad practice/hacky.. just write an interesting essay..Yeah but we didn't have to fill our essays with lies and disinfo to get people to read them cause we didn't care. We also followed those catchy starter paragraphs with non-clickbaity things like actual content rather than shamelessly plugging in our social media and sponsors for four pages just to meet a 10 page threshold so that we can get to the top of the teachers stack (algorithms/suggested links) and potentially get a higher grade (more views/subs/$$$). Sadly this is entirely the state of YouTube and news websites these days. It's worse for news journalists since half the time they're forced to write about opinions they don't actually agree with only because that will get views and stir up controversy.Yeah, well, NEWS isn\u2019t supposed to be written like an entertaining essay.Sizzling starts and exciting ending they were called at school.On the flip side, we are told to write interesting hooks at the beginning of essays, and then are told to read the most god awful, long, boring, and meaningless ten pages of crap that may or may not contain information about the current subject (let's be real I never read them).Well yes, but actually... yesWell, fuck dude, you've got my damn attention. What is it that you're gonna show me or tell me that's so damned interesting? What I'm saying is: You don't know what is it I have to do, you don't know how much I make an hour, you don't know what is it I was on my way to do. You just assume you can capitalize my attention, so you better make it good.This showerthought is a good hook btwNo, I was not \"taught\" to normalize this behavior.We were also taught to write our essays as long as possible, with as much content as possible, but now we don't read email that is longer than 3 lines.Clickbait title then...\none sentence\nad\nanother similar sentence\nad\nan off topic sentence that makes you wonder if it is still same content\nad\n...\nrepeat 51 times\n...\nstory ends abruptly with no point\nlist of 12 more clickbait articles[deleted]you seam to mix hook(something you\u2019ll elaborate on) and click bait (refraising your topic ti lute people into reading it)A good writer shouldn't need hooks. A good writer should use them when appropriate, but should also be able to draw people in purely on the quality of their writing.\n\nSee the first paragraph of the first chapter (not the prologue) of Robert Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" series for a good example.\n\nIn addition, a good writer should abhor clickbait -- the two are different things.and then you go to college and are told that you are supposed to start out with the thesis.Hooks are honest, click bait isntThis analogy doesn't really work - but when has showerthoughts ever had any standardsI was told Use 3 paragraphs: Intro (a quote right here is the \"hook\"), Body, Summation. There are hooks, and there are hooks. Clickbate comes from people above our paygrade. The same kind that re make movies that don't need a re make, etc.A hooked is in context of the message and a clickbait is misinformation or spamClickbait is by definition misleading. If the 'hook' of an essay is misleading, that's just very bad writing.Sorry for the clickbaits but trust me, they're necessaryyeah bc clickbait is more like \u201cExtatic mother hits on unsuspecting tourists. Makes them scream their lungs out! Gives them the real deal! Watch below!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd then the video is 5 seconds long and it\u2019s like someone pomeranian running after a group of chickens in some white people\u2019s yard interrupted every second by 1 minute ads to stupid shit like teeth whiteners or horse condoms and after that you are redirected to some sketchy company site that talks about how environmentally friendly the are but if you check their history they most likely caused the Black Plague .That sounds extremely unacademical.Funnily enough in my graduate program they told me to get straight to the point and to not try sound fancy lol'My essays explores ten weird reasons why Shylock is a victim rather than a villain. Number 9 will shock you!'Yeah but I learned in journo class you're just supposed to be composing a tl;drClickbait and an interesting headline are two very diffrent thingsInteresting, a bit weird... hooks??? Is that really standard practice?Not surprising, considering that Journalism students are literally told to punch up their headlines to make them more appealing to the masses, or at least, that's how I was taught.No you're not told that though. \n\nWhat reputable school would ask you you to write  hook?? You're meant to write a synopsis detailing what the essay is about. \n\nObviously you writing hooks and chatting shit is the reason you failed at life OP.My English teachers never told us to write \"interesting hooks.\"Well some click bait has nothing to do with the video and that\u2019s not what we clicked for, a good starter should then continue down the same path no?Every clickbait is an interesting hook, but not every interesting hook is clickbaitYou were told, not us.Someone did not change their manners since elementary schoolOurs is at least true!But look at all these hookers making moneyBecause a news article isn't an essay.it's not bad to be interesting. It's bad to be deliberately misleading, and compose texts that amount to a trivial amount of content(quality and quantity wise).  Click,get bombarded with ads, they make a few cents off of it and give nothing in return.\"We've all heard of the United States. In fact, one can say that it is possible to live in the United States.\"Yeah but if our hook was clickbait the teacher wasn't fooled and you had a F. So the problem is that news can't get any other F than boycott, and we can't stop reading the news \ud83d\ude14.It's not clickbait if you actually deliver what's promised. I'm an article, hook the reader, then deliver on what you hooked them withMy professors don't even want intro paragraphs anymore.You're pissed, but still click, no? You are only really angry if it's misleading after hooking you.I love that quote \"the brightest minds in the world right now are developing the next commercial app sensation\"You will not believe OP was thinking of in the shower!Somehow this is actually trueWe were not taught to give false claimsOnce upon a time. There was a time when. It is truely believed that. If you look closer to it, it may drop a birdshit into your eye.This is dumb and so are the people upvotingI had a lesson not long ago about doing that and I just said the most click bait thing and she said it was good....\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f whoaaaaaMy first thought when I read this was the end of the first paragraph of A Christmas Carol. Could you imagine if instead of \u201cOld Marley was as dead as a door-nail\u201c it was \u201cOld Marley was as dead as several things! Number 17 will SHOCK you!\u201dInteresting hooks are something different. They are.. interesting. If used the right way. Clickbait headlines just annoy nowadays. And at the time we were not used to them yet they made us curious at first just to let us down with some really boring and not interesting content (usually).\nA good beginning of an essay relates to the content, ist informative and does not leave you in the dark on purpose because the actual content is boring. On the contrary, it often gives you a valid reason to keep on reading because now you feel like you will learn something new that matters. And in any case it should make a possibly dry topic more interesting without letting one down as soon as one proceeds to reading the rest of the articleThe hook was supposed to be relevant to the essay though. Clickbait usually uses a hook that's completely irrelevant. \n\nYou didnt write \"epic research prank gone wrong (gone sexual)\" for your essay hook. \n\nOr maybe you did. Idk. I dont know you. Did you pass?I don't think anybody is instructed to start off their essays with \n- THIS is how...\n- HERE is how.... \n- Doctors HATE....Ajaja skul iz dumb amirite?Umm.... I\u2019m 39 and I was never taught this, not even in college. Is this a thing?I was taught to write your ideas in the begining then elaborate on that and then summarize.And if you ever enter school on a serious, academic level that revolves around science you can rest assure that the professors will tell you to cut that shit out and just describe the research.And then every student starts their essays, \u201cFrom the beginning of time, man has been perplexed by [insert topic here]...\u201dbut news are not entertainment.And your professors in college want to claw their eyes out.Hook is part of the actual text that leaves something huge unanswered or in any other way intrigues the interest of the readerIt doesn't matter what I say,\n\nAs long as I sing with inflection.A hook is something to grab your attention, usually a true fact or question that is proven by the rest of the content.\n\nClick bait isn't true.  Studies have shown that when a news headline asks a question, the answer is no.  The title is nothing more then a shiny object.I use hooks for fish...Just sayin.That\u2019s because most of those articles were written by people who followed that big template \u201cthey\u201d shoved down our throats in high school and college. \nChicken or the egg, my friend...News sites shouldn\u2019t be creative writingIt's a matter of 1)subtlety (moderation rather than overkill and 2)honesty (clickbait articles use half-truths or deliberately controversial statements in a way that's biased).To be fair tho, we probably wouldn't find a five-star restaurant leading off with an appetizer of instant ramen.\n\nNot until those young folks have completed their ruination of the dining out experience.Hooks, not straight up lies or deceptions that leave the reader misled and or pissed off at the end.Thing about schools is that at some point of our education, we stop writing prose and start writing as if each assignment is a university dissertation.Well how do you know it\u2019s click bait before you click on it? Surely you\u2019d be pissed off after being catfished by the headline.Click bait tricks you into clicking on to substance-less or misleading content. That\u2019s why people get pissed. Theoretically the essays that you were writing in school were neither of these.I get where you're coming from, but if something pulls you in with an interesting title and then it's actually worth reading no one gets upset.a hook or interesting title is not the same as clickbait.Clickbait headlines are made to look interesting by misleading the reader.They\u2019re called \u201cledes\u201dI think there's a difference between an interesting hook to pull readers into your social commentary on rebellion against arbitrary governance in Romeo and Juliet versus saying, \"you won't believe what these kids did just because their parents hate each other!\"Hook and clickbait title are different. Hook is just there to grab your interest while clickbait does the same except by lying or having nothing to do with the contents of the text or video.Hooks then deliver. Clickbait never does. Or tortures you with endless repetitions until you get there.Except a hook isn\u2019t meant to be misleadingimagine thinking those are vaguely similarMust of gone to very different schools, mine always told me to just get to the point and stop wasting their time with interesting things.Yeah but when I wrote my essay on Romeo and Juliet I didn't start the first paragraph with \"10 Things Montegues hate about Capulets (#8 will have you SHOOK!\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c)\"Someone tell Gordon Kelly (the writer who makes those \"nasty surprise\" headlines for BGR and Forbes)I made it a point to find a way to start every essay with \"Bees.\" All through highschool. Got 5s on both AP Lang and AP Lit. When in doubt Bees.Well the \"hook \" is supposed to be vague but also related to the essay you're writing ,the clickbait is just an over exaggeration with sometimes no relation to the actual videoHey guys! Welcome back to my literary essay on the differences between Italian and Northern Renaissance! Now let\u2019s just \n\n#JUMP RIGHT INTO IT!Yeah but my paper on Chernobyl didnt include a thumbnail of me shrugging like an idiot with the words \"I GOT CANCER FROM A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN??!\" Written below me in bubble letters.The hook is supposed to be *in* the essay though not the title. The title is just supposed to be a three to ten word thesis of heat the article is aboutThats on the readers though. The hook is to get us interested in reading further, but some people go by the title and dont read all the details.Bot! Beep beep!

Yellow journalism. Ratings? Rankings? Cilcks? Spins? It all equates to dollars really. Does not matter if it's right if it's controversial or appealing it makes money which is what they care about.I use clickbait as an explanation of how to write hooks in my classes! It certainly makes grading more entertaining.Teachers, start giving your students zeros for using click bait hooks. Boom problem solved.At school they teach you how to get a job, not how to be a person. Never believe anything they teach you. Only adopt it momentarily.I guess they took those lessons a little too well.When writing essays in french, you put your hook as the last sentence of the essay so it ends with a lasting impression.a hook to attention, not misrepresentations followed by irrelevant advertisementsWhat do you mean \"we were all\"? I was never taught that.My GSCE English paper be like:\n\"Ten reasons why Aticus Finch was the bomb. You won't BELIEVE number seven!\"\nF for effort.In the UK and Australia we try to  structure the essay with the introduction being just an outline of the question and structure. A \" hook\" is irrelevant.Wasn\u2019t the first school invented by capitalists to make more money from poor children?

Etc... Now to the actual video.\u201d>Also a hook is immediately followed by the content\n\nIn academia it's called an \"abstract\" and is immediately followed by a paywall.Also, a hook is supposed to deliver.  \"Is the Earth flat after all?\" draws you in, but the essay should answer \"no\" somewhere.  In today's time, the clickbait draws you in, and the article doesn't even address the headline.  Sometimes it is off-topicYou won't believe what this guy found in his trashcan while taking out his trash one morning!\n\nJohn is an average john who works 9 to 5 folding boxes for UPS\n\nHe takes out the trash about once a week\n\nThe trash is picked up every Monday morning\n\nJohn took out his trash and happened to look inside...\n\n\"I never expected to find that in my trash!

Click here!)\n\nJohn reached into his trashcan and pulled out a kitten!I couldn't believe #3!!Also, the hook should be an opening to the introduction. The headline or title should be the most accurate, most brief summary of the subject covered.Also a hook usually keeps its promise. A clickbait even when followed up by something that has to do with the tiotle in no way ever really keeps it.The issue isn\u2019t the hook, it\u2019s the lack of substance following it... also a hook is not the same as a purposely misleading title...Gee, calling it information is a stretchIt should be noted that so are most actual news headlinesClick bait headlines are flat out lies.

Everyone in here talking about hooks like that's something you should do after 5th grade...hooks are the first thing I un-teach because they are a trashy waste of everyone's time.College: intro? oh yeah. intros. just copy paste one from a template, i literally only read the last 2 pages anyways.The hook is a line that reels you in to the source.

I read hook and thought music.I was specifically taught not to do that.As the last 20 years have taught us, the most successful way to do the second is to do the first. If you learned *nothing else* from Jon Stewart, you should remember that. Bored people don\u2019t learn.That's not a \"hook\" though, that's just a competent introduction. Hooks are \"attention grabbers\" that hack teachers tell students to start their essays with.Like the start and end of a VSauce video. Starts with something like - why do we feel love? And ends with something like - the Earth is getting smaller in size* clicks on a thread with 1500 upvotes\n\n* notices that 97% of users liked it\n\n* decides to call OP an idiot, assuming others will agree with him\n\n**IRONY**op is equating the twoI know what you are trying to do but that \"hook\" is something that belongs in a young adult novel, not an essay.\n\nAn essay doesn't have a \"hook\" narratively like that. An essay usually starts with a question about what you will be exploring to get your readers thinking about the topic.Where I went to school we were taught to start with the thesis. When I got to university the entire paper turned into the thesis.In like elementary school, but my teachers eventually stopped asking for themWell that's actually interesting. Hooks are definitely stupid, but I've always thought at least a thesis statement should be in the intro? How does that work?I learned in academic writing (English class, not native speaker)It was elementary school style stuff for me, but not everyone learned the same... honestly writing hooks sucked anyways so I wouldn't worry about not learning itWell that just makes too much sense for my school to teachThank God for thatOh I know, I DESPISED writing hooks! once I got to high school and college  and we didn't have to do that I liked my intros so much betterHappy to help lolIt's hard to come up with a hook when you're occupied.

He even had the beep and colorful error screen after every one. This is all after the intro described in your comment, mind you. And after about 8 minutes of this, he finally gets started.

They are being told by YouTube to do it.something a little harder to condense in the way of those tropes, but is also annoying, is the videos where the person rambles on and on, not really saying anything but repeating variations of a few phrases. it just pads out the video, probably to meet some target length.You got to the video sooner than mostI blame YouTube copyright system for thisSo I literally heard Charlie from Awesome Emergency when I read this.

That way readers or editors can chop off the bottom parts and still get the idea it if feels too long without having to skim the whole piece for relevant info.I remember in 5th grade we were learning about the different types of hooks you could use in writing - one of them was asking a question to the reader and then introduce them to why they wanted to know the answer to it (and then presumably answer it).\n\nSo for our writing assignment we watch a video - in this case it's on the impact of the newly constructed Grizzly+Wolf discovery center in West Yellowstone (been there, great place) on the public perception of Grizzlys in the area.\n\nAnd so we all write things like \"Do you know a lot about bears?\" or \"Would you pay to see a bear?\" (basic things a 5th grader writes). But this one kid - god bless him - starts his essay off with \"Have you ever been mauled by a bear?\" - absolutely brilliant. Of course we got the whole speech about how your question has to be someone vague/relatable enough so that it applies to most readers, but I personally thought it was greatTo all my past teachers, my apologies for all those hooks on how great my essay was gonna be from the start.I can confirm that in my school my teacher is telling us to have title that make the people interested, by sometime over exadurating.Concise and to the point. B+#\\#5 will make you fuck your dad!Excellent irony. Solid A.A+ \n\nYou deserve a scholarship to a university, the greatest click bait of them all.Yup. So many people have such a weird definition of \"click bait\". You can bait clicks without it being necessarily wrong informationIt's also something you use to catch fishIs whipped cream a condiment?Rule 34?r/aioli_on_areolasI always think of condom mints when I hear condiments.r/titty_sprinkles/r/CondimentKingsFetishThat\u2019s the whole story bruv, he was just chillin with sweet baby rays sauce all over his titties after chowin down on some homestyle potato salad and a half rack of smoked slow roasted ribs and a 1/2 pound bag of pork tips and cracklin[context](https://youtu.be/Wo9p4Lqaakg)I would think accountants would have at least an indifference to the number seven. Is this some weird accountant who works only in base 7 or lower?Agreed. We were taught to write a \"topic sentence\" that tersely summarizes the content.\n\nThe point isn't to get people to read something that they're probably not interested in, but to label the content so that they can quickly determine whether they are interested in it.This, quite literally the only reason informative writing wouldn't have to also aim to be entertaining (at the very least, written well and structured with a narrative throughout) is if it's \"compulsory\" reading like an instruction manual.\n\nThere you want concise, matter of fact writing because a) if people need you to get the job done they don't need to be drawn in and b) it actually matters that your content is concise and completely devoid of ambiguous language.\n\nAny other informative writing has to have some element of \"narrative\" style or it simply won't get through to anyone, I've read thousands of chemistry papers over the years and even the dryest topic can be delivered with some style. Heck the general structure of a scientific paper is designed to create a narrative, likely because it makes the information way easier to digest.Not good with terminology, unfortunately. Never taught English writing.The paper im working on for monday has 6 points that would end up in the thesis. Instead she wants 6 paragraphs, one for each point.Interesting. I\u2019m a native speaker and I don\u2019t recall this at all.I don't take points off for that, but I tell my students repeatedly not to do it. Most of my assignments require scholarly work, so it's a lit review to start, not a hook. That's a much harder thing to do, though, so I think some students shy away from it and go for what has worked in previous classes for them.he fucked his cousin.How did I forget that!Also, be sure to follow in Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, snapchat, pinterest and be sure to join our new discord!!!\n\nLinks are in the \"down below\"!!\n\nPQI actually didnt know about the bell and was wondering why people kept saying that.

I\u2019ve been using Google to learn cool new things since the public schooling system failed me and it\u2019s amazing. Google has literally an infinite amount of courses on an infinite amount of topics all completely free and with unlimited access.\n\nOh yeah, or you could pay for a lesser service like skillshare, you do you.That part wouldn't be necessary if youtubers didn't constantly get their videos demonetizedI miss the days when most YouTube videos were not monetized and people uploaded funny shit just because it was funny and they wanted to share it.I miss the days when YouTube didn't recommend related videos to you based on length of the video.

I don't like to do what people tell me to do.> I'm sorry you put too much of your useful conclusion in your abstract\n\nAt least fields I'm familiar with, abstract is explicitly to tell what was being studied, not what was found.It's a Legendary Relic of immense, but Treacherous, Power. The Ancients relied on it's Power to great extent, without realizing that the relic was in fact also cursed! Naturally the greed of men overpowered caution and common sense, and as a result, The Ancients ended up locking up nearly all of their knowledge and information. Fortunately though, not everyone was blinded by the alluring charms of The Relic. A small resistance was formed, and eventually it grew to two nations now know as Open Access and Sci-hub.Wooohooo, Sci-Hub ftw!!!This guy journalisms.It\u2019s more like a reverse funnel system!This formula is why so many first year college students write essays that begin like, \u201cSince the dawn of time, mankind has struggled against the natural world.\u201d \n\nIf you\u2019re telling writers to write essays with sections their readers can \u201cchop off\u201d or skim, you\u2019re telling them to add superfluous shit to the essay. Which wastes everyone\u2019s timeI was taught the style stems from the days of sending news via morse code over the wire.

At all. The quality you can find on youtube has skyrocketed now that people can earn a legitimate living on it. Sure, that means many people will try. But, most fail because they simply aren't good enough.People already feel like they\u2019re talking a 0.2x speed in most of my meetings. Fucked if I\u2019m gonna get used to 2x speed..Youtube reworked their notification system. Now you have to click that bell to receive a notification of new video from your subscribed channel. No idea if it means much for me as I'm not someone who wants videos the very minute they're cleared for launch.What a rebel!Really? I\u2019ve been told by most of my professors that the abstract must be your entire paper but condensed, so including a little bit of background, method and conclusionEither way I was being facetious and should'a put the /s I supposeIt's specific to the **bottom** of an article, and specific to journalism, in case the editor couldn't fit your whole article in the paper because there was a lot of other important news to get to.Pretty sure the reason they do that is because we are taught to make our writing relevant by linking the reader to the literature. It's a cheap way to do it and any writing class will tell you not to do that. Instead you should find an actual relevant way to introduce your papers.I agree that a lot of first year college students tend to want to write essays like they're news articles, but I don't think anyone is really telling them to do it like that. I've noticed there's a tendency for students to use news articles as sources in intro level classes, especially composition, and this might influence them to imitate that kind of organization, among other features.I remember when I was in high school, I wrote shorter essays than everyone else, and I often got good marks for them.That could be a reason. For sure one is that newspapers have word limits for stories, so if the writer puts in 600, and the editor decides the story is only worth 500, he can cut the bottom off and not have to extensively edit it so it still makes sense.me as wellGood point. There\u2019s no reason to deduct points.Yes it is, It\u2019s like mustard for piesNo, Patrick, mayonnaise is *not* an instrument...

Can I sue you for property damage?  \n\n\nDon't forget to flubber that up arrow thingy.The first time I ever heard of \"smashing the like button\", it was a Michael Stevens DONG where he made this really awful joke, smiled at the camera for several seconds, then told us to do so.  Not gonna lie, it was hilarious and I liked hearing the phrase for a while because of him.ay yo waddup iss ya boi Xxxextrachromosome420yankitxxX commin atcha wit anudda modda warfurr 2 vidyo yo i gossta apolageyes my voice aint be sounding none like the usual self aight i be sick so smaSH THAT LIKE BUTTON YOU FUCKING ZOMBIE n pray for my recovery swiftThey help you find it though, or would you prefer Bing?Nope, I don\u2019t mean the internet, I do mean Google. I don\u2019t know of anyone who unironically uses yahoo, bing, AOL or another non-Google search engine to search the web. I know there is an extreme minority of archaic individuals which use a search engine other than Google, but they are an extreme minority.\n\nI also don\u2019t think there is any statistically significant number of people who use no search engine or a custom search engine to access indexed and unindexed web pages through a direct URL methodology.\n\nSo no, I do not mean the internet, the internet isn\u2019t a company like Google, it\u2019s an infrastructure. The joke I was making was that Google was the original Skillshare. Skillshare is a COMPANY which provides online learning services just as Google is a COMPANY which provides access to the internet.\n\nMy joke isn\u2019t referring to the infrastructure of the internet superhighway, it is specifically referring to the search engine Google, the company. Google is the original online learning company, it is the original Skillshare. Hence my joke that I am recognising my sponsor Google, rather than my sponsor \u2018the internet.\u2019\n\n+1 point for being witty enough to catch that discrepancy and point it out. You\u2019re wrong, but it was genuinely funny.\n\n-1 point for being wrong and not seeing the obvious difference between what Google is and what the internet is and in your haste to catch me out on a funny and a mistake you overlooked this.\n\nBut I\u2019m not a cunt so I\u2019ll upvote your comment anyway coz it was funny.Yeah, that word hasn't helped anyone but Google and a handful of wealthy *Influencers* - there's another word we could do without.Ah yes, the days when people expected to pay for goods rather than receive everything for \u201cfree\u201d (i.e. funding by data harvesting, ads, micro transactions, product placement)[deleted]Surprising. What field is that?Interesting! I apologize for thinking you were talking about student essays.I thought the reason was because you're made to write 10 page papers regardless of how many pages it took to get the point across. So if you finish your essay and you only have 7 pages you go back and add all that bullshit \"Since the dawn of man\" stuff to pad it out.the style did originate from telegraph systems during the civil war where lines could be cut without warning. But it also makes sense how it would continue for the sake of editors and readers.99/100 because there is no such thing as a perfect essayWhat are you talking about, mustard is mustard for piesWell, [I beg to differ](https://youtu.be/A5jnftBQw2U).how did it gooh noI thought the point of the condom was so it doesnt spread?My videos are usually sponsored by conflict lightning, the free to play, pay to win game that looked at historical accuracy and said, no thanks, and made the Bob Semple tank teir 10Ah, I just got it, squarespaceI think mine was from the days of finding GTAV glitches.

If there's no Wikipedia (or any other sites with that information) you do not find your answer. So, Google makes it easier for sure, but you're still using the wider internet to learn.Is that a copypasta?Google doesn't provide access to the internet (unless you live in one of the select areas where google fiber is available) it just indexes it and lets you search that indexYou're right guys, people getting paid for their work is awful.Except that without a way to pay for all the content production you wouldn't have all this shit you get for free.\n\nThey tried paid models. People voted with their wallets and complained about 99c songs and 99c apps and 99c games.\n\nSo now you have freemium, lootcrates and ads in your free videos.\n\nDon't like it? Donate.Influencers is just the new name for \u201csocialite\u201d though. Famous for being famous. The title they give someone who doesn\u2019t actually do anything meaningful, but writing \u201cperson\u201d u der there name would probably seem offensive.When you're stuck in a job that doesn't pay a living wageEngineering, the specific fields in question would be Mechanical and Space Engineering, the professor that last told me this did AstrodynamicsUnless you have a super easy history teacher lol.

That would be like you searching on your PC for something and saying \u2018I have this information which makes me smarter because of my SSD/HDD.\u2019 No, your storage does not create or provide you that information, it simply stores it for you.\n\nAnd your example is a false equivalence, not intentional obviously. If you were to look up a doctor in the yellow pages, would you accredit finding that doctor to business directory books or the yellow pages? No one uses the yellow pages anymore anyway, they use Google. Therefore you\u2019d say the Yellow pages is the original Google, before people started Googling things, they looked in the yellow pages. \n\nLikewise if you Google a doctor, do you say you found that doctor due to Google, or even due to search engines? Or did you type in an unindexed URL which led you straight to the doctors servers and from there you found their contact information and address?\n\nLikewise yet again, if you go in Skillshare and learn something using a skillshare course, do you say you learned that thing because of skillshare or do you say you learned that thing because of \u2018the internet\u2019? You\u2019d probably attribute it to the company providing the service, not the infrastructure.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019d say you learned it due to course producers which create online learning courses and upload them to skillshare? Probably not, you\u2019d probably say skillshare... And Google... And the Yellow pages... Most people would.I\u2019m gluten free\n\nNo not really, but I\u2019m Australian, shitposting is our specialtyThat\u2019s true, that is what I meant.\n\nISPs sell you the right to access the copper and get anywhere, to technically \u2018get\u2019 on the internet... But yes, Google indexes 99% of what the population accesses and 99% of people use Google (unverified stats) so due to the immense monopoly of Google as a search engine I said Google rather than search engine.\n\nGoogle is to skillshare what search engine is to online learning courses. Therein lies the joke.Before monitization people weren't quitting their jobs to become full time youtube creators. It was just a fun site for people to, what was it? Broadcast themselves?Ads can pay for it and for a few years, ads did pay for it. Then Youtube changed their model, stopped paying out nearly as much money and started demonitizing things left and right. Youtube killed a lot of great channels.[deleted]Too mad for madlads:o wHaT aN uNeXpEcTeD tWiStfI\u2019m writing this comment from the comfort of my Casper Mattress while listening to Audible and shaving my legs in bed with the razors I got from Harry\u2019s. I had some extra time for Reddit at the end of the day because I didn\u2019t have to stand in line at the post office and ruin my new pair of MeUndies thanks to my friends at Stamps.com.Do you want to draw amazing art!?I've heard of Skillsaw!Incredible, if I wasn't so cheap I'd give you a coin or whatever people do here. But I can't give my money to a non-product.Only on Amazon.com!To clarify, by my videos I mean the videos I watch, I'm not a creator.How do you bring up false equivalencies and not see that your entire argument is based off of one.\n\nLet's start from scratch here: \n\nwhat is the origin thing we were talking about? Skillshare.\n\nWhat is it? An online resources to learn skills. So skillshare is a website that hosts information the topics from which you learn, regardless of a search engine.\n\nNow you equated that to Google, which is a website that does not teach you anything. It only points you in the direction towards websites that actually holds the information you want.\n\nMy goal is to see a doctor to cure me, and that was always my goal. I can drive around to look for a hospital, I can ask someone if they know a good doctor, or I can Google it. Google makes it super convenient, but I cannot meet my goal without Google. \n\nAnd you can replace \"see a doctor\" with learning a skill online. The goal is to learn... Not just find where to learn.\n\nAnd last falsity, I said the internet makes it easy to learn (in general) not the internet makes it easy to learn (a particular skill). All of the helpful websites collectively make up the internet and a great resource to learn about things (in general) from even though particular sites may be more useful for particular skills.Yeah, and it showed. If you can't create content full time or hire people, you have a hard time creating quality content. The amateur shit had it's charm, but there's a ton of great stuff on youtube that would not be possible if people didn't get paid for it.And now we have literally thousands of really amazing people creating amazing content. Something we would never have without YouTube monetisation.\n\nBitching about a few people being annoying on YouTube is really throwing the baby with the bathwater, and considering you get to choose who you watch and who you don't watch, it really makes you look like an entitled kid when you complain about that.LMAO\n\nYou've got a lot to be thankful forIf you listen to podcasts, why about Rocket Mortgage, squarespace, blue apron, etc..Oh, are you trying to pay off the mortgage for your beach house too?You joke but stamps.com is the shit. Literally had a USPS worker talk at me sideways earlier today about a label not having though value for the weight and I flexed on him by showing him the value in app. \n\nI'm all for shilling for anything that keeps this government held accountable tbhSee, I get what you're saying, but honestly, at the very least, Audible is pretty great.I can't do that. I will call about the boner pills though.If you learn a skill from skillshare you say you learned it from skillshare. Your goal was to learn something, but you don\u2019t drawn an arbitrary distinction to the skill you learned. You simply learned it from Skillshare. It doesn\u2019t matter what skill you learned from Skillshare, it\u2019s still something from skillshare.\n\nIf you find a doctor from the yellow pages or from Google, you found it from the yellow pages or from Google. You don\u2019t arbitrarily draw a distinction to getting medical attention. What you\u2019re searching for is irrelevant, the topic at hand is the mode of searching - skillshare, Google, the yellow pages.\n\nGetting medical treatment is irrelevant to how you find it... It\u2019s not WHAT you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s how you found it. It\u2019s not the infrastructure of the internet, it\u2019s not business directories and in the case of learning skills specifically via skillshare, it\u2019s not \u2018the internet,\u2019 it\u2019s skillshare.\n\nIf you wanted to split hairs you could say \u2018it\u2019s not Skillshare it\u2019s online learning resources.\u2019 I.e  it\u2019s not the internet infrastructure, it\u2019s COMPANIES which compile online learning courses.\n\nLikewise, if you wanted to split hairs you could say \u2018it\u2019s not Google, it\u2019s search engines.\u2019 But it\u2019s still not \u2018the internet.\u2019 The internet isn\u2019t a company that can provide you learning resources, the internet is an infrastructure. There is no joke in saying \u2018I\u2019d like to give a shoutout to my sponsor, the internet, the original Skillshare.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t make sense, that\u2019s not a valid comparison. I could say I\u2019d like to give a shoutout to the internet, the original learning resource,\u2019 but it\u2019s not valid to compare \u2018the internet\u2019 to Skillshare.\n\nIt\u2019s a company to a company, that\u2019s the joke, clearly lost on you. It is a correct comparison. This isn\u2019t one of those \u2018it\u2019s a tissue not a Kleenex\u2019 scenarios. I\u2019m not falsely attributing Google when I really mean the internet; I do specifically mean Google the company, that was the entire joke. \n\nYour doctor comparison is wrong because finding medical attention is irrelevant. You don\u2019t open the yellow pages to treat you medically, you open the yellow pages to find information. The yellow pages is to business directories what Google is to search engines what Skillshare is to online learning resources.\n\nBoth books and internet infrastructure as the mode of information transfer are entirely random and what you are looking for (in your example medical attention from a doctor) is irrelevant too. You don\u2019t pick the yellow pages to get treated, you do so to find a doctor. You don\u2019t open Google to get treated, you do so to find a doctor, you don\u2019t open Skillshare to get first aid assistance, you do so to find first aid courses.\n\nDoes Skillshare do emergency response and first aid theory courses? Maybe they should, that would be good.and the amateur shit is still there all over the internet[deleted]",

Good on you, OP.They both lead to someone's kid getting fucked.My time has come...the former saying is free but the latter is about 600/hour in NYCGirls saying daddy makes me horny. But it's kinda wrong but that's probably why many men like to hear it.Funny, as a choir boy, my priest used to make me say both. \"Im sorry\" and \"I apologize\" mean the same thing unless you're at a funeral. -Mitch HedbergOne of them you say to a priest as a kid and the other you say in church [removed]It's nice to hear you think about your friends in the shower.Trust me Brazzers already exploited the fuck out of that particular concept. Both a good way to start a porn movie thoughI could get off to a girl saying daddy in a porn video, but if she said that to me I think I would be weirded out.In most situations the second phrase is usually said first and the first phrase is typically said the morning after. Sequence of events\"Mmm tell me about your sins, you naughty boy ;) \"\n\n- The priestThis whole thing of girls calling guys daddy really creeps me out. I was with a Puerto Rican chick who used to call me \"Papi\" total boner killer.I've said this so many times Technically a Choir boy will say both of these to a Priest at one point or another.\"I'm sorry\" and \"I apologize\" mean the same thing. \n\nUnless you're at a funeral. What the altar boys says vs what the priest hearsI would much rather hear \"I'm sorry daddy; I've been very naughty\" though  Satan and Santa are the same yet different.Also...\n\"Butt dial\"\n\"Booty call\"I've been a bad bad boy, Father Browsing r/all is like watching a movie about a horde of Millennial computer nerds coming of age...Because of the implication. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\"I've been a bad boy father\"Connotation This is not a coincidence. priest cant tell the difference BRB, going to confession to start with \"I'm sorry daddy, I've been very naughty\"One of these is usually said before having sex. And the other one sounds like a porn title.I need a long hard punishment. Really long and really hard.One will get you spanked, and the other will get you spanked.*Sorry* **Daddy**, *I've been very naughty*\nFIFYi love it when she calls me daddyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sinsThe English language is a beautiful thing I always liked, \" good lord willing and the creek don't rise \" and \" come hell or high water \" as being this kind of statement.  Both are gonna have the same result, the father/daddy molesting youWhen British people say naughty it doesn't sound half as bad. \nAwkward story, My sister married a brit last year and he had this big wedding with his whole family there.  I haven't met many British people and at one point joking around I called his 12 year old kid a WANKER in a thick cockney accent, Everyone goes silent, turned and looked at me gasping as I didn't realize how bad the word actually was. I figured it was like you goof or something, apparently not. To a Priest. It's one in the same. Good guy OP admits to their faults.Either way you end up with a wet face.\"Suffocate me stronger, Father!\"Por que no los dos?Depends on your fetish ;)One doesn't apologize and the others gets fucked in the ass.Don't worry. Tumblr has stolen more content off reddit than we can count.Either this is a repost or you just stole this from Tumblr. Either way, I've definitely seen this before.ContextGiggety?You just gave some people a million dollar idea.Hot.  \ud83d\ude44Well, they're both on their knees...Yet somehow, both turn me on...Because of the implication. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)This was a kinky shower...And either way you say it, you're about to get the D. ;)To certain priests, not differentShe got daddy issues, so I give her that daddy dick          \n\n\n( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)Get those sky-daddy cummiesWAow words have different connotations!! I am very smart btw /u/thehawkmooner haha/u/theEpitome0fAwkwardbruhOP I like your version better, more simple language always makes a joke smoother. You're not a filthy reposter.Actually, if an adult is saying it, they are equally ridiculous.What a fun lesson in church this week!You inspired me to make this mock-up.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/KynDHNo, they are exactly the same thing.*with a dirty smirk* yupbruhhLewd.Youre right daddy_Yeah_? \"Forgive me father for I have sinned, I hit a 4th gear jump 5th gear pinned\"\n-on the pipe fmxSounds like ImanyWinner of the Beijing Film Festival's coveted Crying Monkey Award.Reminds me of the difference between booty calling and butt dialing tbh.Was hoping there would be some NSFW on-topic videos here. Reddit, you disappoint me.This is so fucking stupid lolNot related but I got so excited for a second when I noticed the url for that post is an \"All For The Game\" reference. I love that series!sounds like someones about to be molested what ever one you're sayingWell the latter would have a *very* different context depending on if a child or adult was saying it. Uhm........................................not if you have a priest kinkUnless you're a priest, then they're pretty much interchangeable.\"I've been a bad bad boy father\"   Kirk Lazarus Either could have been used just before sex though.  bruhhhhhhhhhhhhI can make either work\n\n-skeevy fathers everywhereMonty Python nailed this for many prayers. \"O Lord, ooh, You are so big, so absolutely huge. Gosh, we're all really impressed down here, I can tell you. Forgive us, O Lord, for this, our dreadful toadying and bare-faced flattery, but You are so strong, and, well, just so super fantastic. Amen.\"Man, this brings back so many memories[deleted]But I heard the same two uttered in \"The Offering\". But both end up in sex In each case, amends are made on the knees. > I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the windI can't tell the difference ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)One is asking for forgiveness, the other is asking for punishment.\nThis is a lovely example of the difference between connotation and denotation.\n\nIn English class we once read a book of poems. One of which was about a cat. But due to the language involved, it sounded like an ode to a vagina, rather than an ode to a cat. What's Tumblr\"Allahu akbar\" and /#blessed tooWere you stroking him in the shower at that moment of recollection?He may have been your father boy, but he wasn't your daddy.Sounds like The Pretty Reckless to meDoes it count as a repost if its from a different site?well... who's buying me a new monitor after that terrible spit take?Both have the potential to be a very good time.They have another similarity: both are great porn lines.Haha cuz the former you'd say to a priest, while the latter you'd say to a priest.I'm gonna go to a church confessional and say the latter to the priest, as seriously as I can possibly manage.Hoosier Daddy?In both instances the reply may be \"Well, down with the trousers, my child - let's see how sorry you really are\"the OT bros had issues.I like how naughty doesn't really mean naughty anymore since the popular context relates to sex and kinks. \n\nTFW when a fellow Pinoy was the one who posted thisIsn't it funny that when you use different words there's a different meaning?Oh gawd. Get off the youpornAlso.  \"Daddy,  I've been a bad bad girl and I need to be punished\" is close.  But both work as the opening line to a porno.Unless your an altar boy...HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA, my pastor'll love that joke.bruhBut mostly similarI feel dirty.Depends on the priest amiriteI find the former much more arousing. Apparently someone is unfamiliar with Nun porn.\n\nDUDE. **RULE 34.**They could both take place in the rectory however NoiceOr \"peeing in the pool\" vs \"peeing into the pool\" - Demetri Martin I'd say that counts. I don't view thus sub as strictly OC. I feel even though it may not be original you actually literally had a \"shower thought\" out of the blue he may be your father but he aint your daddyMea culpa, my child. Mea culpa.Dimitri Martin has a joke that is similar in structure to this...anyone know it??It's okay you only browsed tumblr by flesh-proxy. It's a crime, but you'll be out in 5 on good behavior.Confessional probably would've gone a lot better as a kid if I'd known this.same with \"booty call\" and \"butt dial\"Oddly enough, a long time ago, a couple of friends and I wrote a song called the alter boy blues (It isn't a blues song but, oh well). The first line is \"Forgive me father for I have sinned\". It is the single most hilarious thing I have ever done to earn my eventual trip to hell.That's connotation for youI would say the first one is far more deranged and perverse. bruhApparently not in the mind of far too many priests.The first one is what the alter boy says during mass and the second is what the alter boy says after massHello new friend, my name is Fred \nThe words your hear are in my head  \nI say, I said my name is Fred  \nAnd I've been... very naaauuuuuuuughtyyyyyyI've been a baaaaad boy! \nDespicable M3 anyoneBruhhhhhhhBoth can result in sex. Forgive me, Father... for I am about to sin ;) ;) ;)Joke bot pls\n\nI guess daddy means sex daddy ?[deleted]Seems both imply childhood psychological abuse.Shitty repost. get your own shower thoughts.No one fucking thinks this in the shower. >different words mean different things\n\nwow I've been on reddit for a long time, this isnt my first account.  I have talked a lot of shit about a lot of different stuff in reddit world, which I will continue to do.  But this sub consistently fucking delivers the goods.  Respect.Stupid posts like this should get deleted, and certainly not make the frontpage.[deleted]It is pretty disturbing that the entire comment section is centred around the syntax of these sentences. \n\nWhy are people not disturbed by an adult woman addressing her sexual partner as 'daddy'?\nThat's just sick.\n\nI'm waiting for you all to start talking about the subject-verb-object order.  It's already disturbing enough without putting a yoda spin on it.\n\n\nEdit: yeah one of these sentences will probably lead to anal, the other will most definitely lead to anal.Forgive me and i am sorry are not really synonymous.  Having sinned and been naughty are not for that matter either.One of them is a confession, the other is pedophiliac in nature :/StopWhat's with this whole daddy this daddy that crap...I always found it fucking gross and creepy. There is no difference[removed]I'm not sure how they are saying different things at all?\n\nEDIT: Why is everyone making this about sex? You are a bunch of perverts.The man-made concept of sin includes things like\" you thought something bad\" or you \"thought or did something evil\"  where as \"I've been naughty\" is more like \" I smashed my ice cream cone on my brothers homework\",  I don't think they're quite comparable because one thing is real and one thing is imaginary in my opinion.[deleted]ITT: Jokes about child sexual abuse. Thanks again, reddit. no not reallyI bet OP sodomizes men...This is probably the most hilarious example I've seen.Probably relevant to distinguish humans from AIElaborate?? I came here to say exactly this, I learned the difference yesterday in my online class.r/TILSemantics and pragmatics, in linguistic terms. The sentences are the same semantically, but very different pragmatically.     Also syntax vs semantics.\n\nSorry, just finished Turing  Test.So is Demetri martin\u2019s saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and \u201c I apologize\u201d are not the same thing when at a funeral. Wishing I hadn't missed that day in English classWhat are these called? Phrases that have the same/similar dictionary definition but completely different connotationsI had a relative refer to a \"butt dial\" as a \"booty call.\" I'm like no you didn't booty call me that doesn't mean that, don't say that, people will get the wrong idea mom.Like the difference between helping your Uncle Jack off a horse and helping your uncle jack off a horse.When a butt dial leads to a booty call, you're either very indifferent about getting laid or you just got very lucky.Underrated commentThey'd both get it at the same time. It's all about who responds first.Depends on gender and age. I don't get it  edit: nvmBecause only Daddy can actually punish youMe too!I've actually heard \"I'm sorry daddy, I've been very naughty\" said in a prayer at church before. This was from a grown man and it was in front of the entire congregation. It was a huge church too.The second one would sound like a porn in the church.\"I apologize... for murdering your daddy\"\"I'm sorry\" expresses empathetic sorrow, while \"I apologize\" includes a tacit admission of guilt. \n\n\"I'm sorry\" = \"That sucks\"  \n\"I apologize\" = \"My bad\"I'm sorry can mean the same thing as I apologize, but I'm sorry has an additional connotation of \"I'm sorry for your loss\" which \"I apologize\" lacks. It is an example of polysemy.\n\nIt should also be noted that \"I apologize\" is of a higher register than \"I'm sorry\"; it is more formal and serious.I don't see \"forgive me\" and \"I'm sorry\" as interchangeable though.-Demetri MartinWhat about your past children?Or your Once and Future children?Mine can, but only when they are old enoughYou've been called daddy in bed doing nughty things so you don't want your child calling daddy eitherOr if you are role playing as a priest  Fulfilling of Holiness is happening either way.First gold I have ever recieved....and of course, it's a priest joke. My hat is off. Forgive me father; I've been very naughty.All depends on what kinda bad things you have done.Thanks for the laughNaughty boys must be spanked, get over here. [deleted]> [Damn, son!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_x_4UElTDI)\n\n[deleted]Also different result. Usually.[deleted]Instructions unclear, dick stuck in confessional. I wish I could give you Reddit goldAmenThat's not the only colon that could be used properly in OP's post.Semicolons are easy, just put them at the end of most lines and statements.Everybody is somebody's kid though. Not just your time...That's mighty specific info.[deleted][deleted]Must've had a rough childhoodThat's nice of you to say, but I know what I did.A girl screaming that during sex would be so creepy and so hilarious ^and ^so ^hotYou never know, she might be into that ;p Well yeah, that's the joke. [removed]You could tell your girlfriend this though: \"Sweet Mother, sweet Mother, send your child unto me, for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.\" She would be so wet> exploited the fuck out of that\n\nLiterally.Give it a chance.  You might surprise yourself.[deleted]Now imagine your dad passed away recently and some girl says it.\n\nFor the curious, it's not fun.[deleted]Dont take it literally. She doesnt literally mean Daddy like father. Its the same when you call your SO \"baby\", you dont literally mean they are an infant.Seriously can someone explain the rationale behind the \"daddy\" thing? I understand it isn't taken literally like the girl wants to fuck their father but there has to be some weird creepy shit behind it right?\n\nAlso sick brag on the sex with a Puerto rican girlThis always disturbed me about my Puerto Rican ex. It also disturbed me that she would call her dad the same thing and her mom would call her sons same thing but then she would just use it in a sexual connotation. I can't imagine using Daddy like that amongst any non Spanish population. There's a high incidence of incest in Puerto Rico though. There are two types.\n\nThe average girl who does it, it recently became popular, not sure why.\n\nThen there is the BDSM version, which is usually more of a 'father figure' or 'figure with power/caring ways' etc.  Can also be sir, or master, but those are usually for other kinks.  \n\nI am the latter, but being called daddy by a girl is extremely hot af./r/humblebragRelevant usernameThe same can be said about any two things in the universe.More like Gen Z.

Oh well. :P sorry for being a filthy reposter!Speak for yourselfThe thing is they doesn't mean different things but almost the same.You seem really upset. How is this not a fitting post in r/showerthoughts??See my edit...sorry for being a filthy reposter!I don't know what you're talking about, just about everyone here is discussing the content of the sentence, not the grammarWhy do you think referring to a dom as daddy as sick?What man?No, not really.  \nThat's the point.I'd rather be a \"pervert\" as you call it than whatever being so judgmental makes you.Well, in MY opinion, Chicago is better than Donkey Kong.No, one is a kink and people don't need you to misinterpret and shame it.Yes! Weirds me out if I think about it too longNo, it's about daddy kinks and repenting sins in church. This has nothing to do with child abuse.I envy the college students who will see this in their classroom this year.The difference between \"butt dial\" and \"booty call\" is also a good example.I think so, too. I wish I could use it in a class, but I really, really couldn't. Not something you'd see often in r/totallynotrobots thenDenotation is the dictionary definition of something; connotation is the emotions and underlying meanings behind words. While both of those phrases have the same denotation, their connotation is very very different. The connotation of a word or phrase is the contextual meaning while the denotation is the dictionary meaning.Denotation is what the words say. Connotation is what the words imply. \n\nBasically literally vs figurative. Denotation is the literal definition of something. \n\nConnotation is the idea/feeling you get when you read it. \n\nDenotatively, the two phrases in the OP mean the same thing: asking for forgiveness. Connotatively, the second one is sexual and the first is pious.Denotation is the dictionary definition of a word. Connotation is all the ideas and thoughts we have associated with the word. So the phrases \"forgive me Father, for I have sinned\" and \"I'm sorry daddy, I've been very naughty\" have almost identical denotation but very, *very* different connotations. This example is also freaking hilarious. Just never say the latter even if you have something to apologize for...I'll say \"Star-Crossed Idioms\"This is a form of [polysemy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy)You nailed it. I like how you said \"relative\" at first to keep ambiguity, but switched to \"mom\" because you stopped caring.Not really...Maybe they are one and the same?Or does it?Only Daddy Can Judge Me? Thanks. \"I've been very naughty...\"Well yeah, that's why you don't say you apologizeIsn't the latter (apologize) in more times than not associated with \"sorry that happened\" versus \"sorry I did that\"? So, \"sorry I got caught\", instead of just \"sorry\"Already do. West Virginia I bet that's true!Or if you're a role-playing priest*air horn sounds*Fill me with the Holy Spirit, father... \ud83c\udf1aNow where is your collar?It's about the serpent who tricked Eve into eating the forbidden fruit.It's Genesis, chapter 3Genesis 3:14 and 3:15\n\nGoogle is hard.Depends on the priest Or something right with your boyfriendOr something very right If you don't there is something wrong with your priestNot with a semiHow does one use a colon properly I'm not sure it works the way you think it does. \n*mindblown*Everyone has an inner child, so the only way to avoid pedophilia is abstinence.

Wasn't abused though, I just like to pretend to be a little kid coz it's fun.Woah! Is this why people use \"daddy\" in a sexual way? Are that many people abused by their fathers......probably not...ohThe amount of step-mom, step-daughter incest fantasy on pornhub is too damn high. Who the fuck is watching all this weird fake incest porn?\"The weirdest part was that it was my mom who congratulated me afterwards.\"So did they kinda causually force this kink on you, or were they just using it without any sexual connotation? EIther way, so weird!You probably could've banged themEverybody called one of the male RAs in my dorm \"Mom\".I feel embarrass for you, in some countries Papi its just the way woman call you \"dude\". Doesn't mean anything sexual.Story time ^^^daddyI figure it's a domination thing. Fathers have the position of authority over their children, particularly over young ones inclined to say \"daddy\" over \"father\". So basically the daddy/daughter thing is about recreating that power dynamic, and not touching on the horrible implications.No, it doesn't have to have anything to do with an actual father figure. It can be a more affectionate version of \"Master.\" So, intimately submissive.Kinda the same reason Johnny Bravo called hot girls \"Momma\"agreed about the domination thing. I have a great relationship with my father...don't believe that I have \"daddy issues.\" it's more about the idea of a power dynamic that still allows for an intimate and nurturing relationship rather than a cold Dom/sub, master/slave relationship. \"daddy\" or a father figure punishes you for being bad, but also nurtures you when you're a good girl.\n\nit's almost like a validation/confirmation thing, too? in my experience with my fwb, he'll say \"good babygirl\" if I do something he likes, and I'll know that I made him happy.  doesn't have to be a toxic relationship/stem from something malicious.Not much of a brag, imo. Someone refers to a lady as \"hot mama\" or something it doesn't mean they had some weird creepy shit. Or \"milf\". Those are accepted more imo I too have asked, read (not too much, but still) about this, and I always come away (Phrasing, boom!) entirely unclear on the Core Concept.\n\nHas never appealed to me and yes, I find it creepo.\n\nAwaiting also for some Understanding 101 as to subj mttr.People do say that girls marry their father - that their father models what a man 'should' be like and they look for that in a husband. So if she finds a man that she respects and that makes her feel safe etc. she will relate it back to the original man that her father was. Perhaps, as that man makes her feel similar to how her father did, she will call him 'Daddy' as a representation of the role that he fills, rather than as the personal name of her actual father.there was no sex. It wasnt a humblebrag, she was a legit psycho who I could tell stories about but I wont. What is he bragging about?Take your own damn showers, shower stealer. Filthy thought thief.Don't worry OP, the sub isn't called *My*ShowerThought after all!the content of the sentence - syntax: the arrangement and structure of the words and phrases that form the sentence. \n\nGrammar: rules that govern word and sentence structure. \n\nNobody is discussing the spelling, tenses, etc (grammar), but they are discussing and actively comparing the structure and arrangement of the words in the sentences that make them so similar but different. \n\nSo I'm not sure what you are on about, but I have a feeling that you took offense to my disgust at the whole daddy thing. \n\nSimply because daddy is a nickname for father.\nWhat if a grown man was having sex with a dominating woman and addressed her as mummy/mommy - you wouldn't be at least a little unsettled in your view?\nThe man with the power.I like how the person never responded to this very essential question.Somebody who can think about things other than sex for few minutes?Chicago the group or pizza and donkey Kong the game or movielolI said IN THE THREAD. I didn't say the original post was about abuse!!! Please basic reading comprehension. \n\nIf you read the comments you will see what I'm talking about - people taking the church part and making jokes about pedophilia. They actually teach this in middle school nowadays YukOh that's still pretty funny and more appropriate for a college-level classroom. hahaExcellent example sir. That's how a father thinks. Not a daddy.Of course you can. This is a matter of connotation and denotation. You can tie that connotation above, or in the post, back to every other connotation that happens in class. Y'all learned something today We're of the lucky 10,000 todayI wonder if \"What's wrong?\" vs \"What's wrong with you?\" falls into this?I read the first comment and thought I missed a joke. I read your comment and realized they said denotation and not detonation.Thank you. Wish I could give you gold. I'm poor.They can have the exact same connotation, in the right \\*ahem\\* \"artistic film\".This is a great way to use word association and remember which is which. Thank youI like thisI'll say Jefferson Starships[deleted]Close enough. Mom is a guess because I talk to her more than any other relative and likely a safe bet, because she gets phrases she hears mixed up with ideas of what she thinks they mean. It's about..... rated. He meant it connotatively.  Well its score is hidden, so it could be.For my ex they would be. It doesYou're welcome\\- Fred Nope. \"Sorry\" can be replaced with \"expressing sorrow\", and likewise \"apologize\" with \"admit fault\". While there is a lot of overlap on the venn diagram of \"Using Sorry vs. Using Apologize\", they are not interchangeable. \n\nOne can be sorry without apologizing e.g. \"I am sorry that your grandfather died\" (one wouldn't say \"I apologize that your grandfather died\"). One can also apologize without being sorry. For instance, the phrase: \"We apologize for the overbook situation\" is United admitting they caused an overbook situation while simultaneously expressing absolutely zero feelings of sorrow or regret over what happened because of it.\nMountain MamaMountain mama Dungeons and SabbathsPower Word: PromiscuityHmm...role-playing...role-playing chatrooms....where have I heard that term before?Or both.On the toilet, you filthy deviantsWhaaaa?();Repost to /r/showerthoughts Every life form on Earth is related.\n\nUntil someday, we create life from scratch. That will be the first life on Earth that isn't a relative.Speak for yourself.  I have no Lord.Don't forget me ;)How deep is your love?  *Daddy deep*At that point, I'm about to get laid, I'm just rolling with it. Would it be hotter if she was wearing a tightly fit Nun robe?My number 1 rule: If there's sex involved, it's hot.After long consideration I decided to file this away in my mind as eroticly ambiguous, right along side Juliette Lewis.Risky click of the day A vanilla one, at that It honestly depends.\n\nLet me use an example. I once knew a girl who was raped at a very young age. As a teenager, (around 14 or 15) she became pretty sexual. Most people tried to stomp it out and treat it as wrong and unhealthy.\n\nI advised her to take care of herself and be careful, but she needed to feel like she had control over that part of herself. For the time that she felt in control of her body, she had some issues but she communicated better, she was happier, and she took care of her body.\n\nWhen her guardian got involved and tried to control her, she immediately spiraled out of control and ended up selling herself for drugs for a while.\n\nThe point here is, people need what they need, and sex isn't evil. The best thing you can do is encourage them to manage their desires in a healthy way. It is not any more healthy for a victim to fear sex than it is for them to crave it. > Is this considered a healthy response?\n\nThere are two schools of thought on this.\n\nOne school pronounces some turn-ons healthy and others as disordered. This school of thought has fallen out of favour because:\n\n - There is no established connection between unusual sexual desires and other symptoms of mental illness, so why should we place them in the same category?\n - There\u2019s no objective criterion to distinguish the unhealthy from the healthy\n - Nobody has ever found a way to separate kinky desires from sexual desire in the broader sense, and treat just the kink\n - All too often, the pathologisation of sexual desire is really just an excuse to oppress sexual minorities\n\nThe other school of thought declares that there is nothing inherently healthy or unhealthy about your sexual tastes. What matters is how you, as a whole person, respond to that aspect of yourself.\n\nBut notice that the way we treat people who are attracted to children or animals hews closer to the former school than the latter.\n\n> How should a partner treat this sort of thing?\n\nSensitively.After sex, bring it up and ask if they want to talk about it. If they say no, don't press as it may be a sensitive subject and there's no need to bring up a trauma the person doesn't feel comfortable with. In time, they may open up about it, but let it be in their time. Same though[removed]Similar deal here. I am into pet play mostly because dogs are cute and I like to be cute and showered with affectionProbbaly not entirely I've heard it's more of a dominance thing There are lots of reasons.

The whole \"mommy/daddy\" thing just sounds downright disgusting to me... how could you *possibly* think that way about a parental figure!?\n\nWell, here's the answer, I suppose.Considering incest is taboo...sexually repressed people, probably.I mean... you're the one who is aware of the amount \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n[deleted]I'm guessing they did it because he was in,charge and its a joke.

Who said it was strictly a girl thing, either?It's mostly just a power play and a little bit of enjoying the wrongness of it.You're stroking it, aren't you?Yeah I know there's a difference I just felt redundant saying syntax when you already did and I don't have a big mental source of synonyms for it. I didn't take offense to anything, just purely confused as to what the hell you're talking about. I was pretty far into the thread before I saw your comment and hadn't seen more than maybe two posts about what you were claiming the thread was full ofMommies exist. Do you think its weird when people call their SO baby or baby?What kind of power?Yeah priests like 'em young.haha not where I live buckarooHigh schooler Here I can attest to thatCan confirm.\n\nSource: attended middle school not too long agoI got learnedKnawledge Hail YeezusI'm no expert but I don't think it does. \"What's wrong with you?\" uses a reflexive to say there is a flaw in the person you're talking to. Then you say \"what's wrong?\" it's saying there's something wrong externally, not by fault of the individual. \n\nI spent way too long thinking this through so hopefully it makes so sense. It's literally the roots I think/r/StarCrossedIdiomsWell, in that case the SS deliberately appropriated it. Language has been around for I wanna say 50,000 years, I'm pretty sure we have a word for EVERYTHING at this point.I also like to think /u/rycar88 is actually your mom.Why is no one ever just... whelmed?

I can be your lord. ;)Erotic asphyxiation *and* confession? My ultimate kinkShe's shouted \"forgive me father for I have sinned\"\n\nDoesn't matter, had sex\n\nShe put a bag on my head!\n\nStill counts! Is that about confession?Yes. Yes it would.But what if there's also an ostrich involved? would you like to have a seat?[deleted]Everyone knows though that people who like chicks with big butts are more trustworthy, because they cannot lieIt's very fun to be a cat, too.Elektra Complex if it is a woman lusting after a father figure rather than man and mother figure. yes, but how many people who say \"daddy\" sexually are victims of abuse? The link you cited says that 1% of victims experience sexual violence from a non-partner family member. So even if 100% of people experience sexual violence at most 1% of people are abused by their father. And that 1% includes uncles, aunts, grandfathers, grandmothers, etc. and not just fathers. 1% is also what I would estimate to be on the low side of people with a \"daddy\" kink. So your \"daddy kink is caused by sexual abuse by a father\" theory is debunked by your own evidence.No. It's not the answer. I've been involved in BDSM as a Dominant and Daddy-Dom for over 20 years now. The answer is far more complex, because it needs to be stated in what context it's being used. \n\nFor example. In a Daddy-Dom/little dynamic, the little is often someone who wants to escape into a past age mental space, for whatever reason, and be taken care of. Daddy/Mommy is the title for the Dominant because nothing else really fits. A Daddy/Mommy is different than a Dom/Domme is different than a Master/Mistress is different from a Top. In that regard, it's just a title that the person is using. There are absolutely people who are involved in that kind of dynamic that don't want to use Daddy/Mommy for the reason you're touching on here - they feel it's weird.\n\nBut, some people don't feel it's weird. To some it's just a word and has no emotional context to it that ties back to actual family. People in BDSM circles tend to be pretty open about their mentality and kinks, and I've only ran into a handful of couples that were roleplaying actual incest fantasies. \n\nFor most of the people I've interacted with, it's just a word. \n\nQuite a few of the littles I've known have been people who didn't have much of a childhood or felt like no one ever really gave a shit about them. So, the idea of being taken care of in the loving, softer, gentle dynamic that usually encompasses Daddy/Mommy kink is very appealing. \n\nLike every kink, it's not for everyone. And you have every right to feel disgusted by the idea if you do, just do understand that it has little to nothing to do with fetishizing an actual parent. honestly i just don't think that much into it, and it's like semi-ironic. something to do with being dominated probably.\n\nsource: has daddy kinkActually, I knew female residents that did the same thing so uh, you're not alone. [deleted]A friend of mine had a similar problem, though it was only one girl, not three, and she was *definitely* into him. He had a girlfriend, so it was more than a little awkward.>Actually following the rules as an RA\n\nWhat the fuck is this?It's likely for any given person a combination of submission power dynamic, taboo kink, and being provided for (as even \"sugar daddy\" will attest, the word daddy is often associated with money.)I'm not having a go at you mate. For me, it's off putting for someone to refer to their sexual partner with the nickname for dad/father, that's it. Im just surprised that I'm the only one \nLol thats a very good point actually. I don't know if I've ever used that one; I'm used to saying beautiful.\n\nStill cant help feeling weirded out by itOh, the power of voodooThe power of hoodoo.Middle schoolers are too old.

Thank you.Last month we rickrolled our wedding. At the reception we started playing Gangnam style, expecting it to draw a crowd on the dancefloor.\n\nIt did. And just before the drop \"Oppa Gangnam Style!\" We cut to Rick Astley.\n\nPersonally, I was worried that Rickrolls weren't cool anymore. Turns out, they still are.Ive already memorized the url. I still click it anyway. I think this would possibly make a good unpopularopinion postWhat sucks for Rick is that the millions and millions and millions of times that this has been used as a prank he doesn't get paid for the playOne of my favorites is when On the Rocks acapella group rick rolls [the subway.](https://youtu.be/h8WiyX21A1c)\n\n\nEdit:  starts about 1:10 in.Was in jazz band in college, I played drums, our professor brought forth his own arrangement for us to play, a Christmas song I think. I was talking with the bassist and we replayed these couple of bars a few times, and the bassist looks at me, plays the line and goes \u201cdid I just get rick rolled?\u201d\n\nOur professor literally scored Never Gonna Give You Up into a jazz Christmas song to rick roll us lolI can see the thumbnail you fucking walnutRick Rolling is the ultimate prank. It\u2019s annoying to be caught by but completely harmless, and is always amusing to see someone fall for.It's not about the song, it's about the traumas that followEven reading 'Rick Astley' starts the song playing in my headThe week we got married and drove cross-country with all my things in the back of our truck, this song was at its peak of popularity. It seemed like the perfect anthem for our trip to begin our new life. From that moment on, every time I heard it, I remembered our wedding and trip. Three decades later I found out my spouse hated the song because it's all that was on the radio on that trip home. Turns out our \"wedding song\" was only in my head. I guess I got the ultimate rickroll.There are scams that [ bait people trying to rickroll their friends ](https://www.LaTlmes.com/tech/reddit-users-lose-4-million-dollars-over-scam-1) so be careful.\n\nEdit: [Link to song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)He actually has a few bangers.

The song is actually good, so you always got to enjoy a fun song after getting tricked. \n\nRick Astley can put a smile on anybody's face.Holy cow this is reminding me of my first job and a pretty wholesome lady that worked there.  I was about 16, and this was about 12 years ago, and I changed my friends ring tone to \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up\u201d, and when Laurie heard it, she was so happy.  \n\nRick Astley was one of her favorite musicians, and that very song was her and her husbands \u201csong\u201d, danced to it at their wedding, and was just so happy to hear about rickrolling.  She went on and on about how nice pranks like that, that can make both sides smile, are wonderful.  Hard to believe its been going so long.Getting Rebecca BlackedI would rather be Rickrolled than Skyrimed.\n\n(Wow, my phone now considers \u201cRickrolled\u201d to be a real word.

Worse thing in the world to get that song ear worming you.In case any of you want to remember just how good that song is, [here you go](https://youtu.be/YnopHCL1Jk8?t=99)Nice try Rick.I highly stan Vitas - 7th Element as the new rick rollCan we turn MmmBop into the next Rick roll please?I click with Rick.agree. it's wholesome, about a guy promising never to leave or cheat, etc. anyone's dream partner????It\u2019s always just been about those opening drums.

Nice.Wow I really fucking rickrolled myself wtfA good song alternate to rickrolling would be Smashmouth All StarDamnI cant believe youve done this.Me and my friends regularly \"rick roll\" each other with the Swish Swish music video by Katy Perry cause it's pretty awful.How am i this dumb. Didnt even expect the Rick RollThere could be much worse \"rick rolls\" like Friday... Friday... Living it up On Friday... Or what ever. I don't even want to look it up cause I never want to hear it again.You misunderstand the point of a rickroll then... and I'm going to assume you are under 18 from this statement alone. So that means you were under 10 when rickrolling first came out and you weren't fully involved on the internet during the great Rick crusades. This is why we need Internet history class. Never forget.Mobile breaks your trick. It shows the video thumbnail because of the link in the post.Alternative? Photograph by NickelbackI would rather be rickrolled thank baby sharked, Any day!I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHMjD0Lp5DY) would be a good alternativeI can\u2019t find a source, but I remember hearing a story years ago where Ricky Martin was so sick of his own song \u201cLiving La Vida Loca\u201d and as a prank, somebody installed a doorbell for him that played the song anytime someone came up to his front door and he apparently took a sledgehammer to it or something lol\n\nI wonder how sick of this song Rick Astly is lolI remember when I was in middle school, while my parents were driving my brother and I somewhere, the song came on the radio and my brother started crying because he thought got rickrolled by the radio.I adore that song! Great for dancing to!Knew what was coming, still clickedI have this song on my Ipod, so when the song comes on randomly I consider myself rickrolled and it makes me smile.from the hover event showing me the link I already knew what it was gonna be.\n\nI have been rolling others for long enough that I know the link when I see it.\n\nStill clicked it because I agree with you. It's a nice song.Baby sharkI can\u2019t believe I fell for that link. Just wow.DammitI just got rickrolled in 2019\"What's new pussycat\" has been tried and tested!OMG, the guys at work and I were talking about just this subject last week. I think the new age Rick Roll should be\n\n Nickleback - \"Photograph\"Alternative song - A-HA Take on me? Although it too is a nice songBruh this was the last song I played at my wedding (intentional Rick Roll). Everyone loved itI definitely requested this at a wedding. Not my fault they didn't have it on their \"do not play\" list.\n\nBut everyone loved it. Turns out if you don't know that rickrolling is a thing, it's just a good song about love that you can dance to. And if you do know that rickrolling is a thing, it's hillarious, so it makes you want to get up and dance to it.To answer OPs question this- https://youtu.be/slGLYt3--GY -would be a great alternative rickroll.I actually prefer Paula Abdul's cover\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdmBLUUrK30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)I have put that song into some of my Spotify playlists so that I'll occasionally have a nice surprise.In honesty, Meglovania is the equivalent at this point.I'm on mobile\n\nI click the link\n\nThe video starts playing automatically\n\nAutomatically muted because youtube\n\nUnmute\n\nListen to song\n\nEnjoy song\n\nMy thanks kind sirWe should use nickel back then, so whenever you get nick rolled it actually hurtsAn alternative song would be take on me.My husband got everyone I know to send me Call Me Maybe one year for my birthday.

It was awful.No it's not lol it's like stalkers anthem.I mean let's be honest it's FAR better than the gnome one...I mean who even liked it?F*uck youIt\u2019s in my Spotify playlist and I willingly listen to it when I\u2019m driving. It\u2019s a good song.Honestly you're right though. I've always loved Rickrolling people. But I also just have the song on spotify for myself to listen to. It's a genuinely good song and he has such a cool voice.Beautiful. I had my husband's ringtone set to Never Gonna Give You Up on an old phone. Should definitely do it again on my next. He and I both love it.Getting rickrolled is a negative thing with positive outcomesIt\u2019s honestly one of my favourite songs everHAHA I HAVE BAD INTERNET SO I NOTICED YOU MADE ME GO TO THE YOUTUBE BROWSER AND I NOTICED THAT ITS ABOUT RICK ASTLEY SO I LEFT thank you indonesia for having a bad network and you literally need a VPN just to go to Pornh-i mean Reddit yup definitely talking about RedditNever Gonna Give you up is basically the \"Nice guy\" theme song.  It's not really \"nice\" it's just creepy.\n\n>You wouldn't get this from any other guy  \nI just wanna tell you how I'm feeling  \nGotta make you understand\n\nAt no point in the song does it sound like she's actually interested in him.  I mean the song literally says she's never said it.\n\n>We've known each other for so long  \nYour heart's been aching but **you're too shy to say it**  \nInside we both know what's been going on  \nWe know the game and we're gonna play it  \n>  \n>And if you ask me how I'm feeling  \n**Don't tell me you're too blind to see**\n\nThis is a song from a guy in the friend zone who thinks he needs to convince his obsession that he's the only guy for her.First time I got rick rolled I did not know it was a prank I was enjoying the song. But ofcourse at the end of the vid I just thought the guy was a fake ( I was watching a mmorpg game \u201cbank vid\u201d of the number 1 ranked hi-scores player). But i still don\u2019t know if it was legit or a fake rickrolling me.He never will give us upyeah it's not too bad. OH....a strawpoll!\n\n*Clicks*....AW MAN!I clicked that link knlwong full well what it was gonna be, honestly I think I the video is the insulting part it just is so cheesy and you're just sitting there watching it like \"...really?\"  The song bangs thoughI Rick rolled my friend on his birthday. I got him a USB in a shoe box with some kids cartoon DVD as a joke (obviously), he plugged the USB and there were 2 files one text file (an appreciation text and thanking him for being a great friend) and another audio file named (I don't remember but something emotional/nice I guess). He played it at full volume, you know the rest.Its like Joe Mama. Joe's mother is probably a nice person, but its the humilation of falling for it that hurtsYou cheeky bastardI know better. I was the Rick Roller for many years. That, and I\u2019m on mobile so I can see the thumb nail in the post. If you wanted to Rick Roll more people, you should have done it in the comments.Wait wtf why does rick Astley look like Charlie Puth low keyMy disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.guys be careful, people are using video 1444 as a rickroll. it\u2019s a really traumatizing video. be carefulNever really thought it was considered a bad song.Ew.This would be a bit obvious even if it didn't show the link at the topIt's actually pretty good, I sing it out loud and proud from my car when I see someone.Any Weird Al songThe only song i can think of that could possibly duel Never Gonna Give You Up for the ultimate memesong must be Always, by Erasure. \n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWqJTKdznaM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWqJTKdznaM)Cardi rollingFor me, it's the terrible dancing that pains me.

Enjoy a few minutes of peaceful silence after a long and hectic day? **How about 20 college boys sing loudly at you instead!**I bought their albums from iTunes, before they were on that one show.....That\u2019s the point tho, you got to willingly click it knowing what\u2019s on the other side?Yo, don\u2019t disparage walnuts like thatI'd gladly laugh at this insult.And YouTube links show up as red in BaconReader> walnut\n\n/r/rareinsultsWell played, I enjoyed that.ooooo a double rickrolling half twist!I don\u2019t believe you.No this: https://youtu.be/XUhVCoTsBaMDown voting, not because i disagree but because youre a monster that must be stopped.So much this!Did I really fall for it when I knew exactly what I was walking into?Nah [this one](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/207/210/b22.jpg) is probably the second most popular behind the rick roll.Why? The point of rickrolling is that people get tricked into watching, then keep watching because it's so good. That's what's supposed to happen.Rick JamesOnly for those who don't recognize the URL.I thought half of the reason the meme is popular is because it's a good song....(He?) Just released a \"pianoforte\" single for Never Gonna Give You Up. I'm pretty sure he just follows the Foo Fighters around to sing with them every now and then.Had to scroll way too far to find this comment. If we're even going to *consider* a new Rick Roll this is literally the only possible choice.\n\n\n[Vitas - 7th Element](https://youtu.be/IwzUs1IMdyQ) For those who don't knowI\u2019m gnot a gnelfI clicked willingly, I honestly enjoy the song\u201cspared\u201dUUUh, careful!Thank you! I've been a big fan of Taher Shah ever since I was kicked in the head by a donkey.Omg Lolol thats a beautiful song and video, thanks for sharingAre you okay? Who disabled your adblock? Did you check all your locks and windows? Is anything else missing?Because the song starts playing in your headGod damn you.i know better than to click this but damn is it temptinggoddammitI didn't even know Rick Astley was British. Kind of hard to tell the accent when he's singingheh, not too bad!!  he sure gets the audience goingWow this performe was actually awesome. I think it sounds better than the originalDid I.... just....? I\u2019m not suregotta love it when that off beat hi-hat hits in the chorus. damnWhen he was called on stage with the Foo Fighters was pretty fantastic as well [https://youtu.be/DW5Fs\\_lzUh0](https://youtu.be/DW5Fs_lzUh0)Dude\u2019s still got it. I like the older version better too.>He was only 21 when the music video came out, pretty young for a song that sound like an old person song.\n\nWell all today\u2019s old people songs done by people that were young just in the past....i thought he was like 70 or something (in 2019)Yeah heard the stripped down version on the radio this morning and I thought it sounded great.Does this still count as a rickroll? Same song same artist but older?Such a banger.Damn he aged well!That was my favorite 80s movie!Does he know the rules though?NoA full commitments what I\u2019m thinking ofDJ Casper still draws a huge crowd, it's pretty much a staple of any wedding in the UK along with Mr Brightside[deleted]Gangnam style will forever draw crowd.Seems like the perfect song to draw a crowd. The song blew up in 2012. People getting married today would likely have (and their friends would have) fun memories of the song. It\u2019s jussssst old enough to be like a little throwback.The song bumps manPeople like to dance but are often embarrassed too. So any of the songs with cheesy dance moves everyone knows are great. Everyone looks like an idiot so no one does. So now the embarrassed people will join inguess a hit is a hitRick rolling is something I still find odd because as a 40 something Brit this song was just yet another cheesy Stock, Aitkin and Waterman song that had been consigned to Nostalgia alongside Jason Donovan and Bananarama until it resorfaved a decade or so ago. And now he's culturally relevant again off the back of a meme. All very odd and strangely heartwarming.Marry her. Again.Those guys are probs salty that they got bamboozled[deleted]XcQ at the end is all you have to rememberThere was that guy that said he showered with his socksI didn't know about this song before it became a meme but I love it ever since.The original RickRoll video wasn't his.  It came out in 2007, and it wasn't until 2009-2010 that artists were putting up their own music. \n\nWhile the official Never Gonna Give You Up video is currently over 600 million views, the original RickRoll'd video got 79 million views before that one was uploaded.IIRC from interviews, the record company makes all of the money off of it. That said, I'm sure he's made money from all of performances and guest appearances that have happened since it took off.He doesn't have any songwriting, instrument, producing, etc. credits. Someone else wrote the song. As only the performer, he isn't entitled to royalties from the recorded version.A lot of potential yes but no doubt he\u2019s earned a shitton more than if it hadn\u2019t become a memeYeah cause there would be such a current demand to hear the song all the time lol come on bro the exposure alone has extended his \u201ccareer\u201d far past what it should be.What....\n\n\nIt has completely revitalized his career.It wouldn't be rickrolling if you weren't subjected to it unvoluntarily.[deleted]Why thank you.Just don't get scammed ok?No. [This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oGJr5N2lgsQ)so, 99% of the population ?I'm pretty sure the original intent of the meme was to trick people into listening something they don't want to hear. The other similar ones were goatse and tubgirl, remember?The whole point of rickrolling is that you end up watching it all because it's a good song. That's how it started.I\u2019m gnot a gnoblinmaybe you could post about that on /r/showerthoughts[I knew there was danger, but couldn't resist. ](https://youtu.be/xP7go1mIKNI)Read the comments first,  also enjoyed the songIs the donkey okey??I hate you both. Clearly that song taught me nothingI watch a lot of YouTube and would feel pretty icky not at least supporting the creators I like by watching their ads.Well, what I do is use the song as my alarm, so I start the day with the song in my head already. Problem solved.If a song only plays in your head, did it really play?Can confirm. Didn't click. Got rickrolled anyway.\n\nDo do do do, do do do do. do do do do do dododo\u2026\n\nNever gonna give you up...\n\nFuck ya, love that song.Just like losing the gameRemember the 2010 Mantra-- xcQ, link stays blue.A thread about Rickroll is guaranteed to host a mine field in the comments.You think that's impressive? Ozzy has a British accent *and* a speech impediment, but still sounds like a clear speaking American when he sings!So I did some research on this, it turns out that it's all because we change so many words to fit the flow of the song. (For example, if the word \"me\" is stretched at the end of a verse it becomes \"maaaaaayyyyyy\" 9 times out of 10. This is neither American or British but is assumed American because that's where you hear it most frequently.) And because the rest of the world hears so many American popsongs and sing along to them, that these pronunciations become part of their singing lexicon.because there's no accent in the songHe was a teaboy at Stock, Atkin and Waterman. Pushed a tea trolley round the offices. Then got pulled into the studio for some reason and the rest is history.I've seen him live twice and he's honestly quite brilliant, he knows how to work the audienceWell, he *has* had 32 years to work on it.Shit's hotYou know the rules and so do I. So its pretty safe to assume he knows them too.Big man's English as fuckYou wouldn\u2019t get this from any other guyHave you heard the new Hokey Pokey remix it\u2019s \ud83d\udd25Mr Brightside is a staple of all white people's weddings under 45. It's engrained in our DNAWhich is hilarious when you consider the meaning of the song Mr. Brightside.That will always draw a huge crowd.> Slide to left.\n\n> Slide to right.\n\n> ...I can probably imagine what the top10 played songs sound like\n\nI'd probably kill myself working in such an environmentIt didn\u2019t smash YouTube view count records at the time solely because it was a funny video. There were lots of funny videos on YouTube. It was also a great song with a very mimickable dance move.Plus it's got a couple other things going in its favor:\n\n\\- A known dance that even bad dancers can attempt to do\n\n\\- A perfect drop with which to inset the Rickrollthis is the only reasonable explanation. idk why are some people getting salty over my comment.I donno, you're selling the song a little short.\n\nRick's voice is great and it's extremely catchy. Also not too heavy on the synth stuff so it ages well passed its release.\n\nIt's almost impossible not to single along with it.The power of the internet is truly amazing.Maybe so \ud83d\ude02[deleted]And Cwn, 'cause I wouldn't ever wanna see you frown, I'll always do what's best for you. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA&frags=pl%2Cwn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA&frags=pl%2Cwn)and dQ at the start, just to be sure.That is... *ugh*If a company owns the rights to a song, they can still make money off the ads that run before the video regardless of whether they uploaded it. The real issue is that Rick doesn't get the royalties, the record company does.Millions and millions of people know who he is and know this song that probably never would have if it weren\u2019t for rick rolling.Ya got me thereThis is far too meta for me. I\u2019m leaving before someone asks if I want to see Peyton Manning.It's actually ocean sounds this time.hold on haha the scores aren\u2019t in yet..  i myself give it a 9\n\nbut the difficulty rating is what really pumps it up there!im a gnome and you're being robbedWrong sub, you mean [r/showerthoughts](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&feature=youtu.be).Yeah seems like an original ideaI\u2019m sure he will in 5 days and it will get 4 times the karma than this post.Wow, that is *painful*She... She looks like a Karen...That was amazing she is the bestPhysically, yes, but its turned into a bit of an ass.Hahaha!I disable for some sites, but never youtube. I prefer direct sponsors and merch. I ain't got time for autoplay ads, and value my privacy.\n\nAll I want is Destin to build a *FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER*.happy cake daySince I'm not into children's entertainment, YouTube demonitises most of the content I watch.Happy Cake DayThat's a very inefficient way to support the creators you like. Donate a dollar a month to their patreon instead and block ads is what I would do in your situationOP also sleeps on bed of nails to clarifyr/madladNo wonder you are posting showerTHOUGHT about him.\n\n^^^^^^sarcasmI personally followed dQw4 gang.Is it a speech impediment or just a Birmingham accent?What? Yes there is, he sings with an american accentApparently also a super nice guy, at least based on interviews.A full commitments what I'm thinking ofNot just English, he's Lancashire as fuckplease, everyone want's evidenceIIIIIIII just wanna tell you how I\u2019m feelinghokey what?? Hokey Cokey isn't it??It was on our list! DJ didn't play it lol.I'm \"white\"(ish) and under 45 and have no idea what Mr Brightside is.I just love any song that specifically tells me how to danceNow wallow in sadness\nAnd spiiiinThankfully I worked with a ton of really great people and we were usually laughing and yelling at each other to fire the fucking chicken...but yes.\n\nThe silver lining is watching white people \u201cdance\u201d.But at the time he was just another flash in the pan churned out of the Stock, Aitkin and Waterman production line. If you'd have asked anyone at that time which song of theirs would be known worldwide in 2019 I'm not sure amny people would have said that one. I'm not sure many people would have said any of them to be honest.[deleted]Seriously, I almost threw up in my mouth a little bit...It\u2019s not what you think it isYou thought it was Peyton Manning, but it was I, Dio![Ill just leave this here for you](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)I'll be honest that got mer/showerthotsThank youHoly fuckYou bastardIt\u2019s a shame they show the sub icon next to the link now, completely ruins the joke.That was so good SauronThanks for the correct sub.Fuck, i hate that you Got me, take your fucking upvote and shove it where the Sun doesnt shineThats smartHere\u2019s a sub for the best rickrolls.

I don't really get that part. But then you turn around.\n\nAnd... Well. Yeah. That's what it's all about.Hope you didn't pay up front for that travestyDamn dude. Maybe you're too young?You need to come out of your cage, buddy. You'll do just fine.[The peak of culture](https://youtu.be/gGdGFtwCNBE)I can't disagree with you there. There isn't anything particularly special about the song and plenty of tunes are catchy and have been lost to time.Aww... I wanted to see Peyton Manning.I got rickrolled on a post about rickrolling. Well this is a good day.if it wasn't for you, i would've also been gotSame*Nice*No problemThe what?

    "Comments": "Yeahhhhh my mom doesn't give a shitI\u2019m a kid of the late 70s/early 80s...my Atari didn\u2019t have a way to pause games either. My mom will try and talk to me during important cutscenes.Game can't be paused? I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!! \n\n*rips all cords out of console*\n\nLadies and gents, my mom. ^Then 2000's and the teens will grow up and reintroduce the pause button because they got sick of their parents asking why they are no pause button.\n\nEdit: spellingYeah and now my wife gets pissed because I cant pause the game... gg! Me (a mom): how many people on the field still?\n\nSon: 42\n\nMe: Fine.  Come for dinner as soon as this is done.  DO NOT DROP IN AGAIN!I remember one time Mum was telling me to quit but I was partway through something and didn't want to just yet. Computer games (almost universally) used to just exit if you pressed Esc/Escape. She tried it and... This was a new game, and it didn't work! I felt *so* smug.\n\nOf course, I still then had to close the game myself... But boy that smugness continued for a while...My dad actually came by the other day unannounced (I\u2019m married with kids now) and said \u201ccan you pause it?\u201d and I said no, and I think I deeply confused and offended him at the same time. \n\nFWIW, I was in the middle of extracting sealed caches from DZ in The Division. Gotta guard that rope!And now Xfinity's ads are highlighting that parents can control internet access for the entire household; there's one ad where the mom turns off the internet and everyone gleefully gathers for dinner at the table.  Um yeah, I'm guessing this will be ruining a lot of young gamer's lives.My mom just tells me to stop playing it at that point, not to pause it. Well i mean its not like i play online games with friends anyways so doesn't matterIt\u2019s not problem when my mom says to pause the game and I can, it\u2019s when I *can\u2019t* that it becomes a problem, so, I\u2019m not quite sure what the logic here is...I am endlessly frustrated that my 11 year old is currently addicted to fortnite. Luckily, he sucks at it so I usually don't have to wait long for his character to die.We had games in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s that couldn\u2019t be paused either, though they were pretty few and far betweenMaking the problem worse when you lose all your fave coz the power gets disconnectedLucky enough to have a mother that plays online & story-based games, so I don't get yelled at as often.Then they became parents of infants and quickly added the pause back into the games. Well I only play bethesda games, so I can pause away!People are acting likes pause buttons are a thing of the past? That\u2019s only true for online games. I\u2019ve never once seen a game that wasn\u2019t online where you couldn\u2019t pause. 99% if games you can still pause because they\u2019re story baser, single player True story: I used to play the old Pokemon games on my Gameboy Color back in like 1999 before my dad made us leave for school and I didn't want to lose charge on my gameboy so I could play after school. So I would keep it plugged in, and my dad would think that was the sole power source for the system, so whenever we were late for school and still obsessed with the game, he'd forcibly unplug it thinking that he just turned off our game.\n\nStill give him shit for that 20 years later and he still doesn't understand how video games work, god bless you dad.I appreciate the pause button.\n\nI get why you can't pause during a multiplayer / always online game, but in single player games, come on! Its 2018! There is no excuse for there to still be AAA titles with inaudible cutscenes.\n\nOh, and for games that have plausible cutscenes \"press X to skip\" is just as bad (make it more complicated). Its so frustrating to put it on pause just for the controller to slip or your dog to step on it causing an unintended skipped cutscene. UghWell those kids who grew up and created these games are assholes. Games that can\u2019t be paused are worse for this situation. Mommas don\u2019t care they want your attention, I\u2019d prefer to pause instead of having to lose progress, cause either way not interested in the wrath of not listening We also got sick of mom picking up the phone while we were playing online. So we invented Ethernet cords. Huh, my mom would pause my game by pulling the cord. Some might say it was... DestinyNot even close. Business majors figured out they could:\n\n1. Make more money with a subscription.\n2. Make piracy a non-concern.\n3. Ship with horrible bugs and before the game was ready.\n4. Sunset the game whenever it stops making enough money without worrying about people continuing to play that game over the new shit they've come up with.\n5. Make more money with Microtransactions.\n6. Not be bothered with a complex single player experience or story mode unless they want to later. \n\nAll by making the game online-only. \n\nSure, not all games, but many. Not just games, either. No large software company wants to sell you a license. They want you to rent it from them.Like thats gonna stop momsAs an 80's kid whos a dad now, I'm pissed cause I can't pause the game anymore. How do you set aside consecutive undisturbed hours needed to play games these days?My mom tells me to pause at in the middle of a match, so I tell her to shut up and go home, and how the fuck did you get in my house? I'm a grown as man, mom!! Also, happy mother's day. Yeah, let's get together soon with the kids. Ok mom. Alright. Love you too. Bye. Ok. Love you too. Bye. Alright. Bye. End scene. My mom would just unplug the Atari. No time for this \u201cpause\u201d shit in that household. They also developed games that could be saved.Ahhhh. No Would make sense until you remember that many old school online games could be 'paused'.... (Ex: AoE, D1, etc.).And pissed off so many future/current moms/wives. Correlation bla bla causationBloodborne in a nutshell, give me a few sweety so I can get back to Hunters Dream please Too bad it didn\u2019t work. Now our wives ask us to pause games that can\u2019t be paused not comprehending the fact that online multiplayer games can\u2019t be paused despite the fact that we\u2019ve told them over and over again. Yeah, that was me in my RuneScape and then WoW days. Balls deep in a dungeon and I get called for dinner. \u201cNo seriously Mom, look, if I leave now my entire party will wipe and I won\u2019t get the dkp\u201dThankfully when we become parents, we\u2019ll know online games and such can\u2019t be paused and hopefully our kids don\u2019t go through the same as our generation did. \nThough my mum is pretty cool. She knows some games can\u2019t be paused and usually says \u201cwell come down and eat after your game\u201d etc. Dad here, with three sons who have all played games instead of eating, sleeping, schoolwork, chores etc.  \\(I play too, BTW\\)\n\nEnjoy your games, but remember they are **just** games and hold zero priority **irl**.    \n\nI always give both an hour and half\\-hour's notice of supper being ready or whatever other Time To Do Something, so you either pause your game, or your supper will be in the cat/dog for example.   \n\nUnpausable game? Then you shouldn't have started a new 30\\-minute round 10 minutes before \"come off\" time.   \n\nUltimately, line 2 prevails.  Sadly, I will be down\\-voted for pointing it out, and it will be years before you grasp this for yourselves...unless you discover girls.Instead of my Mum telling me to stop playing in the 90's it's now my Wife telling me to stop playing.  It's like they are the fun police.My mom would come in and say, \"Die, save, do whatever...\"My dad once got so pissed that I wasn\u2019t pausing my game to make him some popcorn that he flipped the breaker on me and lost me 3 hours of progress because I\u2019m a dumbass who never saves. He is very proud of his \u2018accomplishment\u2019 to this day.Quality single player games still have a pause button. It\u2019s only multiplayer games that don\u2019t. If you\u2019re super antisocial like me, you can always pause. Yeah so now you're just fucked instead of being able to pause the game.\u201cThat\u2019ll definitely show those parents\u201dNot even fucking closeMost games still let you pause.  It's really online multiplayer that many games can't be paused.  In the 80s and 90s you were a [NAYSA scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF7vt-c2N1g) if you were playing online. Some did. I now find myself frustrated if I can't pause a game. Alternatively, some of us know it's an inevitable battle and made games that save constantly and remember where you were even if the power cord gets pulled ;)I don't think this is correct, but it is humorous. WTF is pausing a game?  Couldn't do that shit in the 70s and 80s.  You play Space Jockey, you play all the way.  You play Stampede, you play till you die.Isn't that even worse?  She still wants you to stop playing.  if you can pause it at least you don't lose your progress.And now our wives tell us to pause unpausable games. The logical reason here is because the internet was created and multiplayer games are usually unable to be paused.[deleted]That and online gaming would have been fucking miserable in the 80's.\n\n\n*insert text transcription of modem noises here*90s' kid here. My mom hated technology. She didn't understand it and it frustrated her. We rarely played videogames or had cool gadgets. Fast forward to now and I can't even figure out which remote turns on what. So kids nowadays will create games that don\u2019t turn off( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) No they didn't, they invented emulators to create a savestate work-arounds to finally beat goddamned Ghosts and Goblins.Do you have any fucking clue how much I would love to be able to pause my game nowadays?! It honestly prevents me from gaming a lot of days. I know something may come up and I would need to leave the game, but I can't because I'd screw over my team or some other reason. It's not funnyWell I only play bethesda games, so I can pause away!\n\nOr, you know, they autosave.\"Can you walk the dog\"\n\n\"Not right this second but I can in 20 minutes when this League match is over\"\n\n\"Okay thank you sweetheart\"\n\nThat's how most of my conversations go with my parents.More like they grew up and became developers and invented games that don't need to be paused and can be played all day because fuck it, they're adults now.My children are going to hate me.\n\n\"I can't pause this game.\"\n\n\"Yes you can , I literally played that game a week ago.\"\n\n\"FML\"\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"Nothing...\"I mean, it's mainly due to devs wanting games to be online now days. First one was Pokemon on Gameboy during a fight. 'shut it off we gotta go' yes but I can't save because I'm in a fight 'i don't care, turn it off'\n\n\n\n\nShit...My ex unplugged my pc when i was playing nier automata when i havent reached save point yet.\n\nFor those who arent familiar, nier automata doesnt have autosave feature.I still lock the door as an adult when I play RPGs that might contain \"romance\" scenes because my mom was an absolute pro at leaving me alone for 2468636 hours and then coming into my room during the exact .00000001 second long scene where there MIGHT have been \"kissing.\"\n\n\"This game is filth. You're not allowed to play this anymore!\"\n\nOk, but it was Final Fantasy 8, mom, not fucking pornman's porn game of porn. Jesus Christ.we built emulators to put on our pc so we can create a save state whenever the fuck we want.Not having a pause button is just bad design. The only games that can \"not pause\" should be online multiplayer games. There's really no excuse otherwise. I am always annoyed when I find a game that won't let me pause.I\u2019m 47 and played my Atari 2600 growing up, but not much else. I don\u2019t game today.\n\nI called BS on my kids for not pausing their games as it was usually to do a chore or favour.\n\nThanks for setting me straight My biggest complaint!!!Born in 1990, pretty sure many games I played were not pause able.Some of them made LoLHello dark souls Are you kidding? I'm an 80s kid, and I even get pissed if I can't save my game freely whenever I want! What happened to the quick save?? I hate those save points!Parents: turns off WiFi*my mom whenever she's trying to talk to me and I'm using any sort of screen that exists in the entire world: \"push pause real quick\".That's how you widen the market for adult diapers.Here I am as an adult wishing I could pause a game to multi-task This reminds me- Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage was really fricken hardThanks MH:W.I had hoped they became Aliens and replaced their mom's with Artificial Intelligence.I question my own reality more then I get answers watching this show. I love it If my kids are playing a game and I want them to do\nsomething, I always tell them, \u201cget to a save spot or pause it if you can\u201d. Then, they get told a little more sternly to hurry up. I don\u2019t want to be that mom that turns the console off like my mom did to me.I used to pause a game and turn off the TV while leaving the console on and go on vacation as a kid for like 4 or 5 days and resume when I got back. Good times good timesIf your in a PS4 you can hit the PS button bring you home which is a universal pause. Except for online of course. necessity is the mother of inventionI'm a 90s kid (actually 1990 kid) and when I started to play my first online video games they didn't have pause option. \n\nMaybe it was more on the 80s kids and my generation just hopped on board with it\nAnd that's why you always carry a ring of sacrifice with you.Too bad.  You need to take out the trash now.On the other hand Concerned Ape, Dev of stardew valley, recently allowed you to pause in multiplayer by typing \"/pause\" in chat. (Sdv beta)The worst was when you entered a battle on Pokemon and there's no way to save or pauseMy mom started to understand that there are games that i cannot pause. Everytime she needs something she asks if i can help her when im finished or when i can pause the game.The games themselves don't pause because the majority of consoles can now suspend gameplay by going to the dashboard.\n\nOnly PC really suffers, unless the game pauses when minimized.I was playing Super Mario Bros on NES and we had to go but I didn't want to stop the game. Because I couldn't save it or because I was being a dick. I don't remember. But after about 15 minutes of my mom telling me to shut it off and me not listening, she just marched over a unplugged it. I was the angriest I could be at that age. I remember it so clearly haha[deleted]When I was a kid, I just paused the game for 7+ hours and turned off the tv screen while I went to school.  It was no big deal, the game was always there when I came back.  Kust had to make sure to put something in front of the 'power on' light so no one knew.That\u2019s fine...but these days those games are making kids pause \ud83d\ude0aNow it just annoys non-gamer SOs.I remember my first \u201cpausable \u201c game- Bump N Jump on Colecovision!others stuck w the tried n true, little rugby, lil leo sayer\nYeah during a 1v3 for the final fight in a Fortnite match, my mother will insist on asking me to do something for her \u201creal quick\u201d and i\u2019m like let me finish this match \u201creal quick\u201d and she gets an attitude. That attitude will usually result in her bitching loudly about me gaming or standing in fromt of the tv complaining while i\u2019m trying to clutch a squads match. \n\n& it\u2019s just like... i was in the **middle** of something. I got her afterwards, obviously. If i could tell her not to be a dick, i would lol. Usually that something that she wants can be done by someone else in the house who\u2019s not doing shit but looking at their phone.I got to reverse this on my mom, dinner was ready and her online bingo game was going and she couldn't pause it since its online. And the children rejoicedAlthough many of my favorite games can be pause at any time and save when exit the level, but in my case I have another problem because most of them are puzzle games or games that requires some planning. What usually happens is that I'm asked to pause, I paused the game and saved, and got back to the game later and felt like \"What am I doing again?\" and have to rethink the whole thing. The games include all Zachtronics' games aka SpaceChem, Infinifactory, TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O and Opus Magnum, and also games like Factorio. \n\nyup. but we all know that if you don\u2019t paused the game, after couple minutes you\u2019ll get your sht unplug -.- I swear my parents only ever need something from me in the middle of a competitive match, and when they need something; it doesn\u2019t wait.  :-/i'm so lucky i live with my dad who is a gamer (primarily overwatch and fortnite) because he understands when i cant pause and just waits out what i'm playing until i'm ready. i dont play many games i cant pause outside of some fighting games but its really nice to have an understanding with him hahaI think they just made the games save-able at any moment with auto saves incase said parents told you to turn that shit off. I\u2019ll never forget playing the first few games with auto save. I still find my self saving again before i leave most games.80s and 90s kids got sick of their moms telling them that they are ruining their future by playing video games, so they grew up, and created a multi-million dollar sport out of it   w e  s h o w e d  t h e m.What about dota 2?No, multiplayer games came second that's all. \n\nAlso, games you can't pause possibly make more money. Not sure what games specifically you're talking about.This isn't a great shower thoughts post but hey, let's give him 32 thousand upvotes.Lmao my wife still thinks I can pause online multiplayers so she can ask me to do something that she just thought of.  \n\nMy wife is 27. Rocket League multiplayer can be paused.\n\nGood developers.Even dark souls in offline mode.Sad to agree it's a reality. In certain cutscene, you can't pause it. Pressing ESC or Spacebar will skip the cutscene. The PAUSE key is not working.So its bc of them that I take beatings af from my Mom. *MOM* \"come here\" *ME* \"wait, I cant save rn, give me 5-10m\" *MOM* \"OK\" (1m later) \"I've told you to get your fucking ass right here\" *ME* \"wait Mom\".      *Slap in da face and grounded for 2 weeks*Through in 70s, and it's a triadOooEvery time i yell \"i cant pause it!\" I try to explain but it never gets through. But it never matters bc i die every time i try explaining why I cant pauseHalf the reasons i die in Dark Souls...First time playing online was Red Dead Redemption and realizing the no pause in online and I ran my horse straight into the side of a mountainBut this is the opposite of what a gamer would want- if your parents make you stop playing because it\u2019s dinner time or whatever, you would WANT a game that you can pause. \n\n\nIf my mom was telling me to stop playing (for whatever reason) and I said \u201cBut I\u2019m in the middle of a game and I can\u2019t pause it.\u201d It\u2019s not like she would say, \u201cOh ok, never mind then, we\u2019ll just go to grandma\u2019s birthday party without you.\u201d \n\nShe would just say \u201cI don\u2019t care, turn it off.\u201dAnd damn them for this. Grow up.A single player game without a pause function is annoying.\n\nYour mom probably had your best interest in mind aka exercise and a balance of hobbies.\n\nThis is r/gaming levels shit tier front page post.r/showerconjectureCan i use this as a quote? Like - PetermcqueenyWhat games besides online games can't be paused?Atari 2600 and Nintendo Game and Watch had no pause. There have been games since the 90s where you couldn't pause it, you know.Semi on/off topic, when I took my mum to have high tea at a nice hotel for Mother\u2019s Day yesterday , I was the one who said to her \u201cmum can you put your phone down?  Are you playing game on your iPhone?\u201d \ud83d\ude13My mom (RIP) was an arcade gamer in the 70s. Got me into arcade & then console games in the 80s. I miss pause options. Sometimes ya gotta per, or need a snack. Lol.Stop saying Dark Souls even tho you can\u2019t pause the game you can just exit and it will save where you were.~14yrs old  playing madden 2005 with my younger brother on brand new Christmas present xbox 360. Had >3 min left in the game. Dad walks in, \u201cTime for bed.\u201d \n\n\u201cOk, dad we have 3 min left.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care I\u2019m shutting this down!\u201d Proceeds to pick up xbox while it is running. I can here the disc grinding the disc reader as both my brother and I let out cries of agony. Ended up trashing the game, ring on disc, and the xbox, trashed the laser disc reader. He felt bad. He replaced the xbox the next weekend. From then on, those who got too close to the xbox were reminded to back the fuck up. 12yrs later I\u2019m still using the same 360 console in addition to the xbox one. No red ring. No issues. Kept it in a well ventilated area so no over heating When you have little kids you can only play turn based any howYeah, I'd never actually say that to my mom. She'd tell my wife. Me (I'm 15): \"Do I have time to play another League game?\"\n\nMom: \"Yes\"\n\n*1 and half minutes into the game, after 10 minutes of waiting (fuck Rito matchmaking)*\n\nMy younger sister comes: \"Come to dinner\"\n\n(Dinner is smaller meal in our country)\n\nMe: \"I'll go after the game?\"\n\nSister leaves\n\n*2 minutes later*\n\nMom comes: \"I sent you sister here, so you can make her the dinner\"\n\n*Wtf*\n\nMom: \"I'm getting sick of you playing this game all the time. I feel like I should throw that computer out of window.\"\n\nGet grounded.\n\nGet banned, because I had to leave some games before.\n\nI wasn't hungry.\n\nNobody has told me I have to *make* the dinner.\n\nHappened 2 weeks ago. Still grounded.\n\nFuck my life.I remember Phantasy Star Online on Dreamcast causing sooo many arguments lolI remember playing this online computer MOBA game, which had a pause button. Every time somebody pressed pause, it literally paused the game for everyone else until the person unpaused it.\n\nI believe it was the Warcraft version of DOTA.pausing was sort of a thing, but really they just made you turn it off, which is way worse, since there was no auto-saves, and save points were few and far between. There was no \"Just pause and get back to it after your chore\". No, it was just, \"I don't care, turn it off and you can play once you finish your chore\". So you lost everything. Then you had to either start from scratch, or if you were lucky it was a game with a continue code, so you could pick up from 1hr or more from where you were forced off.If only that were the case... \nInstead of what really happened.When I was a younger kid and teenager and my mom wouldn't make me randomly pause. She would say 'Finish your level or quest and then do the thing'\n\nNot quite worded that way but something similar.\n\nI feel I was lucky in that regardMy mom just yanked the video cord thinking it was the power cord. She'd strut away while we pretended to cry, and then plug it back in. They also invented lootboxes and micropayments, so what's your point?I would be playing online Halo 2 (back in the day, ya'all know what I mean) Mom paid for online, but didn't realize it (recurring credit card + alcohol) I would \"go to bed\" and 30 mins  later be downstairs pwning n00bs. Was awesome, summer I would almost only play Halo, plus let friends play social, but I would be up for hours secretly playing the most popular fps in the world for hours. Mom paid for online the whole time, alcoholism + love + giving up let me live out my early teens dreams!yeah uh no.Anyone playing CSGO competetive knows the struggle of this. \n\nMom asks for a help, but i just started a new match that will go on for like 40 minutes and then i feel bad for not helping.Or maybe they needed a compromise for everyone playing together online at the same time.Yeah, but now our wife's complain about it. Yea... i dont think parents care still, if your kids bed time is at a certain time, just because a game cant be paused you can be damn sure that game will get \"paused\" another way....and wreck their credit cards with microtransactions.My dad just tells me to get to a \u201csave point\u201d... not realizing most games autosave now. I\u2019m not gonna be the one to tell him. As both a parent and a gamer I find the inability to pause a game massively irritating from both perspectivesThats why you have to do the thing before the next match starts.Today, we can quit it with a save point, though.\n\nYou have no idea how much of a revelation the original Zelda was, when games had to be played in one go, and an accidental reset-button touch was a huge disaster.I play myself but I have also flicked the switch in the fuse box and turned the power off in the whole house, so my son would stop playing... totally worth it resetting all the clocks.Remember when saving games was not an option? The horror!!10 years from now, i'll invent a mom that doesnt tell you to pauseI always give my son a heads up.  I know what it's like when I'm in the middle of an online ranked battle and you can't just drop it immediately.\n\nYou get a 30min...hey just so you know we're leaving a 1.  10 min before we leave I tell him to wrap up whatever he's on and don't start a new one.  If he's still on when we leave it's a hard power down.My mom is nice and learned from my brother before me, so now she says \u201ccome to a stopping point\u201d, which is really nice because it means I can finish my game/level.My mom hates me for telling her how every episode of your show will be going. Thank you, games.I don't think that's a pausable theory...It\u2019s called the long con Yeah, but i can unplug it.\n\nDad nooooooo\n\nBet you wish you could pause now!And now their wives can\u2019t tell them to pause it either!Then they grew up, had their own kids, and realized their grievous error. Online games existed in the 90s too, and they couldn't be paused. You couldn't pause Quake, now, could you? There's still plenty of games that can be paused - but not one of them is multiplayer.*boom* mind blown. Someone get this man some gold, a medal, and the worldI think you can't pause a civ game, especially in single player. You just keep playing one more turn.Games now have basically no content. Sea of Thieves would shit on The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker if the developers included all the content before releasing the game. They are similar in essence My GF gets so pissed every time she tells me to pause Dark SoulsIf you think that stopped my mom...you're wrong.Here's looking at you, Dark Souls.This is a feature to keep 12 y.o. from playing games with people not living in their moms houseWhen I used to play video games I would only play when my parents weren\u2019t around. They never had rules against it, but I still felt guilty playing. Developers grew up hating their friends? Cause that's who really gets screwed here. Mom gives no fucks. The game will be paused. Either by software or her turning it off. Either way your ass is doing what she wants you to do. We also created the Switch, which has a system level pause that always works. (The home button and the sleep button)Looking at you From SoftwareHaving experienced atari before Nintendo came along, the creation of the pause and save features were huge.Freaking Monster Hunter.Me: \u201cmom I can\u2019t pause it, it\u2019s online\u201d\nMom: \u201cyou better find a way to pause it before I pause it for you\u201d Now we're adults and need to pause the game and we can't. My response as the mom when the kid says it can't be paused, \"die quickly kiddo\".  (Note, there were warnings.) Should have grown up and paused momsThey did invent autosave.But mommmmm, I can\u2019t save during a trainer battle!You think mom's give a shit?When I was a kid most games were played on a coin op machine that couldn\u2019t be paused. Moooom! I can\u2019t save during a Pok\u00e9mon battle! And now we have wives who dont care.80s and 90s kids got sick of arguing over who hit whom in cops and robbers, so they grew up, became developers, and invented games that make the call for you.So you have to lose all your progress when it's dinner time?As an 80's kid whos a dad now, I'm pissed cause I can't pause the game anymore. How do you set aside consecutive undisturbed hours needed to play games these days?I had this old Ghostbusters game for Nintendo which didn't have a pause button. That was infuriating.Me to my kid: Let me be clear, kiddo, you can chose to play a game that can't be paused or saved at will, but you WILL have to stop playing and lose all your progress when it's time to do your chores. Understand?\n\nMy kid: gooo gaaaa blppppppp\n\nMe: Good, it's a deal then.\n\nSeriously though, with ADHD, I can't have games that can't be stopped.We had MMOs in the 80s.  And ruined gaming. Fuck those guysThe Atari didn't have pause. My parents gets horrified at the thought of unpausable games due to those crazy stories of kids from China dying from playing for 3 days straight. Like no dad, that's not how this works. Now my girlfriend is going to become a game developer and make games that pause every time our son cries... I\u2019m a Dad. My son is a big time gamer. \n\nI usually let him finish a match or a mission. But if he doesn\u2019t hop to it. Then I just turn the system off. \n\n\nAt first the ps4 was tricky to power off with him having the controller so I just unplugged it. \n\n\nI know I can damage the system. But my word is the mother fuckin law. I giveth and I taketh away. \n\nEven if I taketh from myselfeth \n\nAm I the only one who has a mom that calls at the WORSE TIME? Say just as you start a bo4 match or when your in a top 10 situation on Fortnite? NoYall call yourself human but cant negotiate. I usually tell my parents to wait a minute and prepare to pause or logout or something within that time and stick to my word. And they get what they need and I dont have my blood boil.That wasn\u2019t their motivation As a dad that games (not usually online) I am guilty of doing this to my kidsThere are games that can't be paused?When my kids were little, my wife and I were playing a lot of League of Legends, and a lot of Diablo 3. Whenever we were playing League, we'd tell them not to bother us because we couldn't pause it.\n\nMy kids started to refer to League as \"the no-pause game\", and Diablo 3 as \"the pause game\".Lol this reminded me of a time when my mom would force me to pause or if I couldn't then make me shut it off and if I didn't she'd unplug it saying \" I bought it for you so you don't own it and I can decide to do what I like with what I purchased\" though when I was able to work at 15-16  and bought an Xbox with my own money and played halo until my thumbs almost fell off she'd try to make me quit then get furious when I reminded her of how I can do whatever I like with what I buy. And she could no longer physical force me to stop. Just calmly pushed her out my room told her it's mine I bought it those were your rules and locked my door. Needless to say I moved out at 17 buy my own shit and will never depend on anybody for anything... Thanks Mom? I used to love League of Legends but over the years the \"can't be paused\" thing honestly became a big down point. People keep calling me across the house for things, I gotta make them wait because I can't pause the fucking 45 minute real-time game (and what they want never seems to be quick enough to get back before I'm either booted or 5 levels behind the enemy team), then I feel shitty for \"choosing\" the game over them, they get mad that I \"blow them off to play video games\" and it just gets miserable for all parties.Now they're parents themselves and realize what huge mistake they've done.What games can't be paused?Just press the home button on your ps4 or Xbo, voila game pausedMom here: I don\u2019t care if the game doesn\u2019t pause. Get your butt in the kitchen and eat your dinner. How has nobody in this thread mentioned that every major console has a system-wide pause button that always works? PS Button on PS4, X Button on Xbox, and Home button on switch. Hit those at almost any time and your game will pause, and now systems have the ability to leave their games running in rest mode, so saying \"I can't pause\" is even less of a viable excuse nowadays. \n\nI routinely play a game, switch to watching netflix, pwoer down, and then come back to my game on the ps4 right where I left off. It's great.I hate that these games are in real time. As a parent wouldn't you feel frustrated with it too? My brother is obsessed with these games and if you want him to do something you have to wait a good 15 minutes before he's able to because he can't stop the game. :/ Doesn\u2019t work in my house.  You either pause or lose your progress. Not being able to pause, to me, feels more rude than begrudgingly pausing. Never had a problem with it. Just a game, especially online multiplayer games. You die just start a new matchMmm dark soulsnope, devs no arent \u201880s and 90s kids\u2019 whatsoever, otherwise theyd know pause is crucial when your wife is yelling at youAfter I ask twice with no response, I power cycle the router. I seriously had no idea there are games that can't be paused. I mostly play single player games so maybe you are talking about online games. But even the ones I play like CS:GO I can quit anytime I want if something comes up. It's not like I owe it to anyone in a Deathmatch to stick to the end.\n\nHaving no gamer friends is fun :PAs an adult that likes to play games, I understand that some games can\u2019t be paused, but it sucks sometimes. Destiny came out the month my daughter was born and it was a horrible time Except parents who were born in the 80s/90s who are not developers. It takes us a million times for our children to claim they can\u2019t pause for us to believe them. If you have a PS4, rest mode is a pause for any game.But save state style saving makes non-rpg games too easy. I mean i can understand pokemon and similar games having that, but if darksouls had that it would be too easy. Regardless thats a good pointUnpausable games started were coming out long before we 80s kids became adults and became gamedevs. And if anything, this has shown me how important it is to be able to pause a game at any time.\n\nAs an adult I usually avoid games that I can't simply pause or stop playing at any time, without long-term repercussions. (Reduced kdr or epeen are not repercussions).I know the games cant be paused yet I still ask them to do it anywayd....35 yo momJokes on them: Now moms say \u201cfuck your KDA ratio, come eat dinner or you won\u2019t get any later\u201d.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s definitely what my mom would\u2019ve said.So now they just rage quit.I rather used to play out in the sun, and was asked by mom not to play during afternoon. Kids these days have to be forced to go out and play. Makes me sad :( I don't even want my kids to play video games. They're just so different from when I was a kid. I could play a game and possibly beat it in 30 minutes. There was no saving. Now games are so involved, mature, and game play is only limited to the kid getting bored of the game, which isn't likely. I don't want to deal with a kid who would rather play a game than go fishing or do something outside with me. Pause the game is the nice way of saying stop playing.Honestly if you're playing online other people are depending on you why would parents want to instill a value like being nondependable? And being a quiter? My mom wouldn't allow me to just walk away from a baseball game so she shouldn't let me quit my online games either. As a mom and a gamer, it sucks.  And unless it's emergency, I all for whatever match to end.[deleted]I remember when I first got a SNES and saving games felt like such a huge leap! Before that, it was up to us to write down passcodes n' such.Ok story time. 1986, I'm 12 and we had an Amstrad 6128 and the game 'The Great Escape'.  You are in a prisoner of war camp, you have to gather items and formulate and escape plan. All the while you have to make sure you attend roll call and meal times or you'll be missed and a search party despatched. \n\nAfter many weeks trying out different plans, learning the location of all the items I'd need, getting jailed a lot and the game ending innumerable times with me losing all hope in solitary I was ready for a run at completing it. \n\nThere was no way of saving so I had to do it in one sitting. I stole a trowel and got a tunnel started, hiding it under the stove in my dorm. I got a map and documents and daringly stole a guard uniform that let me move about freely at night as long as I dodged the spotlights. The uniform allowed me to get wire cutters. After three hours of painstaking play I had everything I'd need to escape and survive on the outside. I could hardly sit still during the evening meal, I even had a walk round the hall to say a surreptitious goodbye to my comrades. \n\nNight fell. I put on my uniform, gathered my map, documents and civilian clothes from my stash and got ready to move. I took the tunnel. It came out beyond the first fence. Just two fences stood between me and success. I got to work with my wire cutters, quickly making a hole big enough to crawl through. As I started through, disaster struck. I hadn't seen a dog patrol approaching. If I ran they'd see me and it was solitary for me and all my equipment confiscated. All I could do was freeze and hope. Amazingly the guard walked right past! I couldn't believe my luck! As soon as they passed I sprinted to the outer fence, cut through it and I was free!\n\nI'd never completed a game before, I waited with bated breath as the screen went black....then a message came up. 'You encounter an Allied patrol and are taken into custody. You explain you are an escaping POW but because you are wearing a German uniform you are shot as a spy.'\n\nIn my panic after encountering the dog patrol I'd forgotten to put on my civilian clothes. Game over, man. Game over. \n\nTL;DR old games were unforgiving as fuck.[deleted]Naah, not just any important cutscene. But an unpausable important cutscene.This was the worst!My fianc\u00e9e always does this. Or I\u2019ll be like \u201chey I\u2019m gonna zone out and play a video game for a while.\u201d And she\u2019ll be like \u201cok sounds good.\u201d Five minutes later, it\u2019s \u201cwe need to figure out tablecloths for our wedding.\u201d And it\u2019s like, woman, we\u2019ve had all fucking day to talk about tablecloths why didn\u2019t you ask earlierholy FUCK i feel this. My mom has some fucking superpower to know when I'm in the best/climax cut scenes of games.\n\nThe ending of Bastion\nConvergence of spheres from Witcher 3\nFinal Boss of Dark souls 3\nMirrors edge, Limbo, Braid, New Vegas, Oblivion\n\nEven after I moved out she called me at 2 AM during the ending of A hat in time while she was drunk!\n\nShe has super powers I swear.\n\nShe also had the usual habit of walking in on every sex scene from Witcher 3 and mass effect.Hang the dev that maps the \"Skip Cutscene\" button to the pause button. I\u2019m so glad god of war pauses whenever you hold the ps button.This is one reason I love the record function on my console, I record the past 5 minutes if I miss anything during cutscenes and rewatch it.\n\nIn the latest God of War (possible spoilers) I actually missed the conversation with the Witch of the Woods after she helps the boy and only caught the important part because I recorded it. I would have probably been confused very later.[deleted]Bro my wife tries talking to me in the middle of Overwatch ranked games and says to pause it. She's 34, as am I, still doesn't understand how online multiplayer games work. Also probably doesn't care but I try making jokes during The Voice and there's hell to pay. during MGS4 cutscenes you can probably fit in entire lecturesI once sat through an earthquake (in Mexico city) because just moments before a cutscene had started in AC: Brotherhood and I wasn't gonna miss that shit.\n\nIn all honesty, the earthquake wasn't that bad (relatively speaking) but the protocol is to bail out as soon as you hear the alarm.MGS4..  45 minute long cutscene but it\u2019s all importantONLY during important cutscenes. My mom turned Paper Mario off after I\u2019d been playing it for two hours without saving. She hated that you had to find a \u201csave block\u201d because other games (DK64, OOT, etc) could be paused and saved at any time.\n\nShe was convinced (and is to this day) that the save blocks and things like Pok\u00e9mon battles where you couldn\u2019t quit were there to force you to play longer, which would worsen your \u201caddiction\u201d to video games and make you dependent on purchasing new ones.\n\nJust the other day she told me that they were opening up clinics for people addicted to social media and that I should get off the phone before it was too late and I needed treatment...My parents it was\n\n*me playing un-pauseable game* \n\n\"Pause the game and save\"\n\n\"I can't pause it\"\n\n*they power it down and corrupt my save*\n\n*has to start back at last save, 4 hours ago*What the parent should do is say something like \u201cyou have X minutes and then I need you off of the game\u201d and then if the kid is still playing that\u2019s when you pull the plug. It\u2019s not fair to the kid to just expect them to jump up at a second\u2019s notice, but it\u2019s also not fair to the parent if the kid ignores them after they gave the kid a reasonable time to step away.My mom loves games. She\u2019s always understood that they can\u2019t always be paused and saved instantly, so she\u2019d always say \u201cok, look for a good place to stop then go [do whatever she needed]\u201d.\n\nNow we play Overwatch together :)I remember when pause buttons weren't a thing.  The first console to have a pause button was the Atari 5200.  It also had the first RF switch where you didn't have to flip a switch on the back to change from \"Game\" to \"TV\".\n\nI was so envious of my nephew for getting one.  He also had the track ball and Centipede.  At home we just had a 2600, I remember playing Missile Command for hours and asking my mom to take the controls when I needed to go to the bathroom.i fucking hated that video games were \"making my brain leak out my ears\" but the kardashians and the redneck jesus family were important tv.And because of that the auto save feature was invented.Some kid in my competitive overwatch match had his mom do it to him. I was pissedWe had to leave gameboy turned on while we went to zoo,  because kid couldn't pause game,  so had to leave on. Battery went dead... Kid was bawling while saying.. \"Allll that Hard work! \".  I finally related to him when my puzzle I was working on got bumped and knocked to the floor!  I caught myself saying g same thing.. \"All that hard work! \"My mother\n\"You can pause it, you just don't want to.\"I use the gaming headphones while playing multiplayer games and my less bulky earbuds while playing sp games.\n\nWhen I have the gaming headphones on, my mum understands that shits going down and doesn't interrupt unless necessary.\nMy dadI got the toe of deathMy mum cut the power cord to my computer ~15 years ago. With scissors. That can\u2019t have been safe.My mom use to just yank the Xbox out it never fully came out because of the lock in power cable but it did destroy the game inside only had halo reach 3 days when she did that luckily I was able to get it fixed. She would always get angry if I traded in old games that I don't play anymore because they cost more when first getting them but would happily throw a brand new one across the room.Do we have the same mom??!?!It\u2019s because of your mom that we got the Nintendo Switch. All the cords get unplugged? Okay, I\u2019ll just take it out of the dock and play handheld. This was my mum when I was versing Gruntilda on Banjo Kazooie. I criedMy mom shuts down the entire Electric system....Well to be fair kids say that and are lying all the time.I don\u2019t want to boast but when I was playing Rise of Nations trial version I couldn\u2019t save the game. My mom said to me that I should save it and stop playing and I said her that this was a trial version and I couldn\u2019t save it. After that she bought me the full game so I didn\u2019t have any other excuses to play more.\u201cPause that game or I will pause it for you!\u201d \nThen proceeds to ask me how to turn it offTrue storyOr they got sick of there *being* no pause button. Seriously, as an adult I hate when games don't let you pause, just because there's some sort of online component, even if you're playing solo. I'm ready for the pendulum to shift back.Circle of lifeWhy are you no pause button? Yeah...my wife doesn't care. If she needs something, she expects my attention whether the game is online or not. Unlucky, if you play league of legends like me it doesn't happenIt's easier when I tell my wife I'm starting a game. That way she knows how long the session might last, so she won't ask me for anything in the meantime. Same here!  She thinks its bullshit they make games that can't be pausedThankfully my husband will ask for something then peek around at my screen and go \"oh your in, dungeon, raid, pvp etc.. I'll get it\".\nI do the same for him.\nGet your wives into video games! \n(Sorry no advice for how to deal with parents. Maybe do your homework and chores THEN video games?) But mum, I've already had a chicken dinner@ u/kraivo and u/azzu I didn't know that made me a cool mom....but from another mom perspective I will say this only goes this way so far.   For example - my son shows me youtube videos sometimes of kids LOOOOSING it over video games - crying, yelling etc.  If my son gets too worked up about a game Ill say, \"Don't be a youtube kid\" and he usually calms right down because he knows he's being silly.  But if he doesn't - game goes off right away.....mama got no time for that.  It's a give and take of respect I think.So strange how everyone knows fortniteYou are cool mom, thank you for thatFew feelings better than watching somebody's childish \"I win\" button not work. Doesn't matter if you still get the result you didn't want, because you had the satisfaction of them actually having to use their words again.Your mom gives up too fast. My mom would have just pulled the plug at that point.I see you're a man of culture as well> gleefully Anyone can already do this through their router control panel.  Of course people used to be able to point their external TV antenna but a segment is so lazy they pay the cable company to \"bring it to me/ do it for me.\"That's been around since at least the 90s. I jnow because my parents discovered this arounh the time that i discovered internet porn. And wee-NamityName was not going to let some rules on a computer keep him from jacking it late at night.   \n  \nAnd that's the story of how i first learned to hackHaha. If she has to turn off the internet to get everyone to go to the table for dinner I doubt they'd be happy about itJust keep a large collection of offline games. I have a 4 terabyte drive filled with games and comics so I would be able to outlast my mom and brother. That is assuming that the internet restriction doesn't apply to essential stuff, because I am a university student and a lot of my assignments are handed in online.It's not a bad idea to cut off the internet if your kids are addicted to it. My parents used to do it while I was in the middle of gaming when I was younger, and I was pretty mad about it. But looking back, my reactions to it were really cringy, and it was probably the best thing to do. It would usually be 1 the morning, and I still wouldn't be sleeping.. If they didn't cut it off at that time, I probably would be staying up until 2-3 in the morning. I'm quite thankful that they limited the internet. If they didn't, I probably would've become a wreck of a person.\n\nAlso, nowadays, most parents will have a pretty good grasp on how important the internet is in daily lives, so they would probably only turn off the internet in extreme situations.My parents tried the whole turning off WiFi at night. I got my neighbors WiFi. The neighbors started doing the same thing. I got my router's password. My parents yelled at me for messing with the router. I got my parents addicted to Snapchat, Netflix, and Reddit. Now the WiFi stays on all night.Theres an ad for an ISP like that on the trains I catch, but the mum looks so ecstatic at being able to get everyone to dinner by turning off wifi it was scary, she looked like a controlling psycho. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to \u201cruin their lives\u201d, but it is going to make for some tense dinners.  My dad can control the internet, but I've discovered it reverts to factory settings (unblocked) if I just unplug it for a moment. I mean you've been able to do that with higher end routers for ever, when I was 14 I set up the family routor and there was a site I could control all the traffic on it with. I remember once my mom pissed me off (probably by asking me to pause a game) so I banned her from the house wifi. Jokes on you Mom I don't have any friendsThat\u2019s why the equal and opposite development was to create games where you could save and quit at anytime. Logic is simple. You're enjoying something and you didn't want to pause stop.. so being able to do so and made to do so made you think that it won't happen if you make games not pausable/savableBuy another pc/console, queue at the same time as him and stalk him through the whole game until you want him to stop playing and just shoot him in the faceStream snipe him If I heard the last paragraph from my parents, all hopes and future dreams might shatter.[deleted]wait what\n\nhow do you only play games from one publisher? That's disgusting.There are a few exceptions like Dark Souls... which I suppose has an online component... but generally yeah I\u2019m not sure what people are talking about.\n\nThough... I suppose online games *have* become much more prevelant these days, with a significant part of gamer culture being focused on online competetive games like LoL, Overwatch, HeartstoneIf I'm not mistaken, you can't pause Moster Hunter Worlds right?Yeah online games didn't have pause buttons in the 90s either, but I guess they're bit more prevalent now than they were.\n\nIt used to just be limited to online shooters and MMOs, whereas now it's...well online shooters and MMOs, but more of them. \nAnd now we have online MMO shooters!Those would just be games with online play. You can't pause because then everyone gets screwed. (Not to mention the coding nightmare)And then blame me for the hard drive failing after doing this repeatedly. PunnyMy mom would put my adult ass over her knee if I told her to shut up and go home.Yeah that was the biggest issue if you ask me. Playing FFVII and my mom would tell me to wrap it up and go to bed, an hour later and I legitimately haven't found a save point and my mom would think I'm just B.S.ing her when I told her I haven't been able to save yet. Yea, AoE had a universal pause for everybody which in theory is great but good god there are people who spam and troll with it.\"You just don't want to/don't care about me\"\n\nTrap card activated!My mom always let me get to a stopping point. That goddamn pun.Is that why she's an EX?not trying to be a dick, but you're the one who decided to have him, not the other way around. You CHOSE to feed him and wipe his ass and make him dinner.Neither of those are important so if they call and want you, you goThere are plenty of older games (and some new) where it's not possible within a short time, often because of unpausable cutscenesYes, unfortunately. Mainly the always online games but there\u2019s a few. As an avid gamer with a 1 year old these games have now become irrelevant. That's when you uninstall and never look back.Most online multiplayer gamesNot when you\u2019re online.I came here to say this would never stop my mom\n\nEdit: Downvoters, pause reddit and go eat your dinner. [deleted]Sure, in single player, but more and more games are multiplayer-only nowI take it you don't have friends to play with online?But why though...?DAE muh kids these daysSo you\u2019re saying we actually made things worse by removing the pause function... We played ourselves?Because there is a sense of importance to physical tasks that is not attributed to things like videogames. To most of our parents, playing a game is comparable to watching TV. That\u2019s how I got my parents to back off when I was a teen. \u201cThere are people relying on/waiting for me.\u201d When you explain that there are 3 of your friends staring at a screen just waiting for you or 4 strangers relying on you they tend to understand better.As a parent of teenagers (4 kids), the problem is you can't run a house based on the game play of 4 kids.  It's not possible to hold meals till everyone is finished a game etc.  I have been in IT and gaming for 30 years, I remember wolfenstein coming out in 1981.\n\nPart of game play is being responsible enough to manage your own time, if you know a meal will be ready in 30 minutes or chores are required to be done etc.  DON'T START A FUCKING GAME YOU CAN'T STOP.Ow, as a dad, this is an easy one. Either there's an activity where we agreed on duration, say a baseball game, or \"two games of fortnite, 3 if you die right away\" or \"30 minutes of minecraft\"  and I'll honor the agreement. Or. There's no agreement and my whims are law. And dinnertime is dinnertime RIGHT NOW. Maybe your parents are urging you to fulfill real life obligations instead? Online gaming \"responsibilities\" are not important or meaningful. This is coming from someone that used to be in a hardcore raiding guild in world of Warcraft.It sounds like you need to explain to your parents that when you're playing an online game, there are other people who are depending on you to be reliable in order for them to enjoy their experience. There is give and take here though, you can't just expect compromise on the part of your parents - just as they shouldn't expect you to turn the game off whenever they want you to, nor should you start up an online game whenever you want and expect to not be disturbed in any way whatsoever for the duration of your game, regardless of what is going on.\n\nDepending on what kind of parents you have, possible solutions to this problem include, but are not limited to: \n\n* defining mutually acceptable time frames in which you will be playing online games during which your parents can't expect you to be responsive to them, \n\n* pre-emptively going to your parents and saying \"hey I will be doing X for the next Y amount of time, if there is something you want me to do before then, please let me know now, otherwise I'll take care of it afterwards,\"\n\n* only playing these kinds of games when you know your parents are busy with other things and won't want to talk to you or ask you to do things,\n\n* scaling back the amount of time you play online games if other players' dependence on your continued presence is interfering with the obligations you have to your parents (which like it or not come above your obligations to your video game teammates, since you voluntarily take on those obligations when you choose to play that kind of video game)\n\nAs with basically all conflict, pre-emptive communication (in which you actually seek to understand and empathize with the other party's point of view, and don't simply focus on your own point of view) goes a long way towards solving the problem before there even is a problem.\n\nThis obviously won't work on all parents, but in the general case, respectful discussion in which you seek to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise is going to work better than the stereotypical teenager-parent argument where neither of you makes any attempt to understand where the other is coming from and you assume they are out of touch fun hating assholes and they assume you're a disrespectful teenager with poor priority management skills.As a current parent and former gamer, it\u2019s not about being non dependable, but listening and time management.  If you have homework to do, do it first.  It\u2019s not my fault if you did what you wanted rather than what you should do.  If one of your responsibilities is the family pet and you\u2019ve ignored it, you need to do what you\u2019re supposed to do.  If I give you a warning and a timeline (say 30 minutes or more), that is enough time to properly plan an exit strategy.Did you do it?One set of lives and one set of batteries. \nOh, just remembered there were PC games in late 90's-2000's that still used passcodes. OofThe NES had saves. I'm pretty sure the first one was the original legend of Zelda.\u201cMom only sees the suggestive movement\u201d cutsceneOnce upon a time, pretty much no cutscenes were pausable. Pressing pause would often just skip the cutscene. I'm still afraid to pause cutscenes to this day. Which means that for me, cutscenes are still not pausable. Except by pressing the system menu button on consoles, those things save me so much anxiety. Yeah but before, you were interacting with her and distracting her from wedding planning. Once you start playing the game, she gets bored, starts on her to-do list, remembers tablecloths, and requires your input. (Source: been there)[deleted]Been married ten years and am an avid gamer, she's not, we can be sitting around doing nothing for half the day no problem, but ten minutes into a game and magically she needs my undivided attention for some unimportant nonsense... W: go play some games and then later on could you cook dinner and do the washing.  \n\nM: sweet sounds good\n\nW: \"45 mins later\" hey can you pause that and make dinner now?  \n\nM: nah i cant pause just gimme another 10 minutes. \n\nW:UGHHH FINE..ILL MAKE DINNER.\n\nM:.......Fucking Christ I will trade you. My wife has the ability to walk in and no matter what game it is, I will be dead in 5 seconds. It doesn't stop :) > Even after I moved out she called me at 2 AM during the ending of A hat in time while she was drunk!\n\n\nYo that is better than any game. Unless she was calling you to ask you for money or to yell at you\nThere are scenes in Mass effect and Witcher 3 that ARENT sex? TILIn New Vegas and Oblivion you can pause during dialogue and in cutscenes thoYou're right. I will suggest we change it to Delete Save with Confirm on the B button. That's convenient.Are they mom or wife proof? When I first played guns of the patriots (first mgs game I ever played), I told a friend I was leaving soon after I finish a cutscene and can save and quit. About an hour later they were wondering where I was. She probably saw that on Facebook > She was convinced (and is to this day) that the save blocks and things like Pok\u00e9mon battles where you couldn\u2019t quit were there to force you to play longer, which would worsen your \u201caddiction\u201d to video games and make you dependent on purchasing new ones.\n\nI don't think back then it was actually engineered that way. I can attest that I we had to do some pretty stupid things because of memory limits, cpu register limitations, and other fucking dumb backwards hacks because every console system was a mad rush to release without fully thinking it through (yes SNES, lets make every cartidge custom hardware that can override cpu instructions so when we actually burn our rom and find out our manufacturer uses a different firmware from china instead of japan we must improvise because mode7 for some damn reason switches to monochrome and flickers -- true story it happened during a cutscene so we left it because it added effect).  \n\nAnyhow I entirely think games today are designed with human psychology in mind and prevent saves or pauses or other simple action because **microtransactions**!If anything, I think long intervals in between saves would cause people to show more restraint. If I knew I couldn't save for another hour, the game forces you to consciously confront the fact that you'll be playing for another hour. But for games with no specific save points, \"just 5 more minutes\" easily turns into hours and hours.\n\nIt's the same reason I'll binge a show with 20 minute episodes much more readily than a show with 40 minute episodes. Humans are just really, really bad at estimating overall time spent when the discrete units are smaller.Tell your mom to fuck off. :)Everything in moderation. I\u2019m sorry for your youth...When my mom wanted me to stop playing Final Fantasy IX one school night, I told her \u201cSure, just let me find a place to save first.\u201d And then my brother asked, \u201cWait...do you think she even knows what a save point *looks* like?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how, but we managed to stay up three extra hours by saying \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to save yet!\u201dShes right.Actually, this guy who was addicted to gaming came to my school the other year. He had been on an addiction clinic. He told us that at first it seemed normal, with him just liking video games more than anything else. Then he started playing more and more and being less with his friends which left him completely alone. Then he stopped going to school, and almost never left his room anymore. In the end it had gotten so bad that he had a bucket in his room to relieve himself because he couldn\u2019t leave his room. He probably would\u2019ve died in a month or so if child protective services wouldn\u2019t have taken him and put him on that clinic. \n\nApparently that\u2019s a totally real thing that you should be cautious of.Just here to say that Paper Mario is one of the best video games of all timeTo be fair, that is a small reason why the traditional save game method isnt seen as much anymore. Tho it also provides a challenge etc.Well if you can save, you can pause. All games that you can\u2019t pause are online, in which you can\u2019t save either. I\u2019ve never played a game that you can\u2019t pause, but you can save? And then they go on to brag about how they made us go outside at least or wtv, not knowing she just guaranteed you\u2019d spend at least another 4 hours on that game. \n\nUgh. One of my ps2s (I had broken a couple from overuse) could literally NEVER save anything. I had tried 6 different memory cards but it just pretended to save. Every. Time. \n\nI still haven't beaten one of my Spyro games yet. Every Sunday morning, I put on Spyro and play until mom goes apeshit. Get a little farther each time... The closest I got was a cinematic with THE ACTUAL BADDIE but I still had a few eggs to rescue \n\nSuper disheartening, gave up and played other stuff for a few yearsI once corrupted my save and had to start from scratch.All I had to do was say \u201cit\u2019s an online match\u201d and I\u2019d get told to come down after the round was done. If she caught on it was single player she\u2019d say \u201cbullshit, come down and eat before it gets cold.\u201d \n\nI now realize I came from a very lenient home.. \nThen because they don't understand they just cost you hours of your life they think you're crazy for getting pissed. This is what my mother did. It worked really well. We had a verbally-established rule on it. \n\nIt was an especially good truce after I grew past the \"only 30 minutes a day\" limitation they had for the first few years. She would tell me 5 minutes before, and I could almost always finish up what I was doing so I could save. Usually I finished up and saved. If I was still playing, she'd point out that it had been 5 minutes and I'd turn it off because fair's fair, and this was the arrangement I'd asked for.\n\nFor all the goods and bads of any parent, I gotta say this was A+ parenting. \n\nShe even understood about cutscenes after awhile. Happy mothers day, Mom.Most likely that's what actually went down. I imagine something close to:\n\n\"Anon, dinner is in 30 min sharp.\"\n\n\"Okay dad/mom, I'll be down soon.\"\n\n30 minutes later...\n\n\"Still playing the game and not at the table? Let me just unplug this real quick.\"\n\nAnd anon forever remembers this night as the night he lost hours of gameplay because his parents unplugged the console. It's a harsh thing to do, but 10+ years ago parents didn't understand the amount of weight hours of gameplay can hold so this was a fair lesson to them. Their idea of video games is anything from pong to super mario most likely.The best was when I was little and playing FIFA on my Sega Genesis, the clock was at 25 minutes or so, and mom told me I had to stop when it got down to 15. She had no idea the clock counts up.As a parent who grew up with the  old pullering parents, this is what I do. Kiddo gets a reasonable warning. \n\nSometimes he tries to push it \u201cjust 5 more minutes, I can\u2019t quit because xyz\u201d but I usually hold him to the original time. Unless it\u2019s an online game that really is almost finished or has a overtime sort of system. Eh, its still not great if you are in a huge area where there are literally no save points. I got stuck in a level that took roughly 45 minutes to beat once and the last save point was 30 minutes previous to this. \n\nMan that day sucked assI would have really loved if my parents did that. But only if they provided a clock or a watch or, shit, even an egg timer! They were just \"move. Now.\" And if I didn't immediately start leaving she just started pulling cords out of stuff this is pretty common.\n\n95% of the time there's a horror story it's because the mom said dinner's ready soon. Then it's served on the table and the kid still isn't there.\n\nYou're damn right.  No pause on the 2600, or on the arcade games down the street.  You want to get to the kill screen?   Stand there.  Play the game.  And keep playing.  No bathroom breaks.  No snacks.  Play.also like 50% of the runtime is ads anyways unless you like paying extra every monthActually, the 2000s brought cutscenes that you couldn't pause, so...I just want games to have a local multiplayer option again. Yeah it's cool to play online, and there's always people to play with, but getting to play Monster Hunter with my best friend *in person* instead of each in our own apartment would be nice.[deleted]This a directed attack on dark souls right? I have that problem in offline play.Unless it's urgent, I just expect to get my husband's attention enough so he knows there's *something*, and at his next opportunity whatever it is gets addressed. I know how his games work, so we both try to be reasonable.[deleted]I play 1 min bullet chess games so it\u2019s not a big time commitment. My wife can even Fucking give me that. Just non stop talkingtrue shit if you play league there\u2019s no way having a wife is happening The problem is that you're play league.You guys face each other in your set ups instead of side by side? How come?parents make extra chores pop upYeah, unfortunately parents never seem to realize that they are the adults in a given situation. My mum was usually pretty good with this stuff - she just needed me to do my chores, normally. Sometimes I just didn't want to lose my progress was all... I wasn't always the best with just doing my chores beforehand haha.When I was a kid my mom came into my room, took my tv, and brought it into her room because I wouldn't listen to her telling me to stop playing games. \n\nIf I had children, I'd probably be changing the Wi-Fi password every day. They only get the password once they do all their chores to my satisfaction.Or elseTo shreds, you say?*Within Cells*[deleted]Or my dad walks up with a big ass magnet...I feel like cutting off the internet at 1:00 isn't what we're talking about. The type of person who would buy something based on \"shut off the internet at any time!\" Wouldn't only turn it off in extreme situations.A good friend of mine's parents let him play games and access the internet for an hour and a half a week.I honestly wish my mom had done this with our internet time. My brother would get on RuneScape and that was it. If anyone else had anything else to do on the computer, well tough shit.\n\nThis led to me literally fighting my brother for the computer. Whenever I got a turn on it I would hold off going to the bathroom for as long as possible because I knew as soon as I left I wouldn't get a turn again all day. I wasn't doing anything more important than him, but I'm pretty sure having the option of using the computer taken away is what made me not want to give it up.\n\nThis is also how the computer ended up broken. I had something I actually *needed* to do, and he had been \"just 15 more minutes\" for about 3 hours. We were fighting and I just literally smashed the power button and it broke. Then no one had the computer.\n\nAnd you know, to be really really honest, the only thing I regret about breaking the computer is that it cost my mom money to get it fixed. Other than that, his shitty ass deserved it, and I feel a smug satisfaction every single time one of his computers starts having problems.Its just one of those things, we all get mad at our parents for withholding what we want.  But those of us that were fortunate enough to have restrictions as kids grew up to appreciate free time and learned to be content when not getring everything we want all the time.  The kids who didnt will have to learn that the hard way, as adults and all at once because the real world wont give you anything if youre not prepared to fight tooth an nail for it.\"Jimmy, *shoots character in face* your mother says dinner is ready\" [Some Chinese dude something similar.](https://kotaku.com/5972406/father-hires-in-game-hitmen-to-deter-son-from-playing)So... every online game?Probably Skyrim and falloutAsk people who only play league or counter strike, etc.By being too poor to afford more gamesI get why a game like Dark Souls wouldn't allow you to actually pause though.\n\nImagine being able to pause quickly, quit, and save yourself from death.Monster Hunter is heavily geared towards its online; did earlier MH games have pause for solo play?You are right, but I think the game saves After each quest. So the lost progress is quite minimal. At least that how it worked on previous games. I Realy enjoyed that :) Dark Souls is a single player game series with no pause function, but they are the exception.At that point its assaultI can't help but think what went through our parents heads. What save point? Good if I ask him I look so weak.> good god there are people who spam and troll with it.\n\nThat is exactly why it was removed and future online games of all genres stopped implementing it, lol.\nWell part of the reason, yeah.This here, you\u2019re not more important than your parents as a child. If you\u2019re still at home by 30, then yea you can yell back and refuse.That sucksYeah. Haven't played in years except for sporadically here-and-there. It's just too much time commitment to be making when you got other shit that can call on you at any moment.That\u2019s when you say brb and sit in town or lobby, nbd. There are plenty of rest areas even in online gamesparents like to feel that power trip, ya know?No we paused ourselvesPause was awesome...\n\nMum: \" Pause the game.\"\n\nMe: \"Can't. Playing against friend through modem.\"\n\nMum: \"Dinner's ready.\"\n\nMe: *huuuuuuuge internal conflict ensues*I feel like playing games is worse than television to a lot of Boomers/gen-Xers.Kind of true, but weirdly enough watching TV is normal human life stuff, but playing games on the consoles/computer is considered a totally different thing! One thing is just sitting and watching, while the other is being  interactive with it.I mean there is a big difference between walking out of a sanctioned baseball game and leaving the millionth fortnite match.Growing up my dad couldn't have given less of a shit. No matter what I was doing and where I was, I still had to go to the fridge and get him a beer.The strangers thing would make it worse for me. My mum doesn't understand the online gaming thing and thinks that everyone online that's not my friends is a 40 year old pedophile rapist psycho. I've tried to explain the anyone Ive ever seen on a game, wether I'm playing, a friend's playing or I'm watching a YouTube video is just some normal person having some harmless fun. Wow, reasonable parents, huh?\n\n*Don't lie to me, those are robots / You like playing with 60 year old men? / You like playing with kids? / I don't care!*Parent PSA.\nSomeone make this into a meme.\nStraight up. It didn't matter what I was doing. If it was gaming or if it was playing football outside of my dad said to stop that activity for whatever reason that was law. Hell I had a part time job when I was 14 that wanted me to work Christmas eve, my parents were divorced and i was to be with him for Christmas eve and my mom on Christmas. The job initially said I had to work it and he told me I'd be quitting and getting a different job if that was the case. Thankfully they understood and gave me the day. He tended to make an exception for hockey tho. He really was into that one.     There's no agreement and my whims are law. And dinnertime is dinnertime RIGHT NOW.\n\nThat's a good way to **needlessly** piss someone off; At least it did to me. If there's something that *needs* to be done, sure, priorities are priorities and sometimes the unexpected comes up and changes plans, but when it's something that could'ave been arranged and avoided, such as dinner being earlier than usual, and the parent's answer is \"Do as I say\" it just makes me lose respect. It royally pisses me off because they either didn't have an answer to a situation that could'ave been avoided but wasn't because of them, yet they \"win\" just because they're the parent, or they do and they simply don't give a shit about teaching their kid about organization, how to have a proper argument nor that it's okay to make mistakes and apologize.\n\nComparatively, hobbies are less important, of course, but if it's something that could'ave been avoided, I **am** trying to organize my own time and when the answer I get for **me** having to give in due to someone else's fault is \"I'm the parent\" and \"Do as I say\", yeah, it pisses me off.And sitting in an office pushing pencils isn't important: *You have berries to gather!*\n\nSo many humans wasting their time on meaningless paperwork when they could be making new spear-tips...[deleted]Playing NBA jam and having to copy those damn codes on my gamegearYup, I forgot Zelda and probably a few others, but you can't deny the vast majority of games didn't have perma-saves.I got the gold Zelda cartridge for Xmas in 1989. Played all day and then the next.  Thunderstorm took out the power and the save game...\"Shepard fucks an alien\" cutscene.\n\n[Relevant.](https://twitter.com/psybermonkey/status/978282981101010945)I've noticed on my PS4 that some cutscenes just keep going while you're in the main menu, though.This is a fear I also always have, as a result of missing some critical cutscenes when I was younger by trying to pause it. I like you am now to afraid to attempt anything to pause it, even pressing the system console button. The fear is real. I don't know which is worse, unpausable cutscenes or unskippable cutscenes. I remember when I was younger playing Assassin's Creed 1 before school, I used to go eat breakfast and get ready during the cutscenes.That\u2019s why you set up tasks ahead of time you know will distract her. You have to set up a guidance system And don\u2019t get me started on those wooden signs with the artsy lettering that looks like fucking comic sans had a baby with Korean cursive and then that baby had a stroke. I bashed out mason jars filled with glass beads underlit by cheap led puck lights. Put paper flowers in the jar, wrap a ribbon of your weddings color around the base of the jar so it hides the puck light. My wife's grandfather owns a sawmill so he gave us milled inch-thick cuts of poplar to rest them on.\n\nBasic as hell but it's a cliche for a reason. \"gimme another 10 minutes\" in a game is the equivalent of a woman saying \"ill be ready in 5 minutes\" when shes putting on makeup.That's on you man, she knows perfectly well that those \"10 minutes\" are actually at least 30.As much as it's nice that they thought of you I wouldn't want ANYONE calling me at 2AM just to talk. It'd just piss me off unless they had a serious and immediate problem they needed me forTime straight up pauses during dialogue, at least in NV.You need the relationship canceling headsets. The brand I got uses machine learning to cancel even future relationships.The most reliable source of information.It was probably on her favorite channel for information - Fox News.\n\nShe and my dad brag about the fact that they\u2019re not constantly on the computer like most people and keep telling me how everyone is too addicted to \u201cmonitors.\u201d They were pretty smug when the studies came out showing how personal posts were sold to companies.ReKTMumsnet.She's probably also from the generation of non-pausable games. Lol Oh the irony...It was system limitations, but the [posters in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle](https://m.imgur.com/ZfkQ0WU?r) and rumors of \u201csubliminal advertising techniques\u201d did NOT help.Have you done an AMA?I think you just inspired EA to require micro transactions in order to save on their next big game.Yeah definitely. If I know a new game I'm playing is in chunks, rather than being able to save any time, I'll play like an hour a day, whereas saving anytime games I end up playing all day accidentallyIt's the same with eating those damn 'fun-sized' chocolate bars. and then you look over at the pile of 23 wrappers on the couch next to you  :(Thank you PS4 Rest Mode. I can \"pause\" my single-player games anytime I want.Mom.. Social media told me that I wasn't addicted to it. Telling mom to fuck off on Mother's day\n\nIt's a bold strategy Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for him.Happy mothers day! NOW FUCK OFFExactly!  Balance in all things - including balance.I have OCD and sometimes it gets to the point where it gets intermingled with depression and I can see how it can lead to situations like this. \n\nThe game is not an \u201caddiction\u201d but rather a coping mechanism taken to an extreme degree - basically with actual OCD you feel like \u201cif I don\u2019t do X then -insert terrible thing here- will happen.\u201d That\u2019s why it often ends up with symptoms like anorexia or cutting.Terraria doesn't pause in single player, i believe starbound doesn't pause eitherDark SoulsMetal Gear games with 30 minute non skipable cutscenes come to mind. Souls games bro. Can't pause, off or onlineMonster Hunter: World.\n\nEven if you're playing solo offline, you can't pause. You can bring up the menu to save, but the game doesn't pause.To be fair, when you're a parent, and you got shit to do, you sure as shit aren't gonna stand around and be 30 minutes late so your kid can find a damn save point of finish a raid. You got real things to do. Were they ps1 games? \n\nI borrowed a ps1 Spyro game but didn't have a memory card for it, and ps2 can't save ps1 games on default card.Not my mom!  It's like she actively refused to learn how game saves work.  And it's not like she was dumb or anything, she's a programmer.  I moved out of that house flabbergasted thinking that she was an isolated incident and I'm the crazy one.  The internet changed that perspective, but my trollbrain said nah that's a generational thing.  Our generation *knows* about save points and lack of pauses.  No way it will continue as life goes on.  My fucking younger-than-me wife doesn't understand save points.  \n\nTL;DR: Life will find a way.Honestly if you actually went along with that and didn't try to bargain more time, I gotta give you some props too. [deleted]\\> And anon forever remembers this night as the night he lost hours of gameplay because his parents unplugged the console.\n\nAlso, the food wasn't ready to eat for another 20 minutes.[deleted]apart from 3 or 4 games most cutscens are pretty short. Rarely more than a minute or two.\n\nIf dinner's ready in 5, don't do something that might start a cutscene.Unskippable cutscenes too. So if you die, you'll also have time to learn to meditate as you mutter along with every single line of dialogue because you've seen it so many times you're ready to break something./r/localmultiplayergamesApartment? Then your username lies!> Monster Hunter\n\nMH generations ultimate was announced the other day for the switch <and only the switch>.\nthough the save data is supposed to be transferable if you have the 3ds gen game.If you like local multiplayer (but not just AAA\u2019s) you should definitely look into AirConsole, a browser-based platform for these games where everybody plays with their smartphones and a common screen. I\u2019ve had a blast both with the kids and with my colleagues from work :)With the Xbox One I have returned to LANing as much as ever. I have 3 slims and 3 tv\u2019s set up for my mates and we play Overwatch together.\n\nNo games really use Local Area Networking but nothing stops you from being next to that person as long as your internet can handle two.For me I\u2019ve sort of lost all interest in single player, especially campaign based games (roguelike games I will consider when there is no WiFi for my laptop). It just feels like either it\u2019s all scripted so you\u2019re not really making decisions (even if there are multiple paths they are each generally scripted). Another feeling I get is that it\u2019s not a level playing field. Either the npcs are dumb and easy or they are overpowered and I feel like the only way to beat them is by exploiting known and static weaknesses.That\u2019s super reasonable. One thing a lot of lazy gamers won\u2019t admit is that they more than often just hope you go away/do it yourself/forget about it after the game finishes. Wow that is incredible. My significant other nor my parents have any idea of this concept Lol. \n\nThis is a good solution. 1 minute bullet chess?\n\nTell me more. That\u2019s why I got my girlfriend to play league too; and I don\u2019t even have to duo with her (she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to look bad in front of me\u201d or something). \n\nBut never once has that conversation \u201chey I need you to pause\u201d come up. If I\u2019m in a match it becomes \u201cokay let me know when you\u2019re done\u201d(likewise for her) \n\nUnless it\u2019s an emergency like I got a really bad cut while making dinner and need to go to the hospital... \n\nUnless they have a weird fetish with unhealthy amounts of salt.The problem is that he are play league?L shape desks with a server tower in the middle. Only one server technically, an uninterruptable power supply, modem, router and storage for controllers and parts.. Main reason is its just how the space allows. Our office/gameroom is in the basement which is more rectangle than square and has support beams.. We ended up with my side closer to the wall allowing more room for him to use VR. My side is more like a sitting room. There's a swivel rocker chair for guests/spectators and the dog bed etc.\n\nAlso he's much taller than I am so his monitors sit higher, I don't actually see him. He's scared me a few times if I get really into something and forget I'm not alone. LolI have a little brother, whos dealing with this daily. He plays games too much and has no time-restrictions - but too be fair when the parents need him to do something its \u201coff get off, pause your game\u201d even when he\u2019s playing with real life friends from school.\n\n\nThe lack of dependability is horrible, the understanding is not there.*dramatic music plays*deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5301  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/45815)When I was younger my bedroom was the attic of the house. The cable to my room ran through a splitter that was in my parents bedroom closet. When I wasn't listening or being loud late at night they would disconnect my cable line from the splitter. This was early 2000s before I ran an internet connection to my room and before we had WiFi.And beats my ass with a pair of jumper cablesBut anyone can shut it off at any time by unplugging it. Don\u2019t they realize he could just use a computer at school, borrow a friend\u2019s, go to the public library, etc.?Yeah, schedules are important for kids. They don't have any time management skills.All 5 versions of Skyrim.I\u2019m the same way except I didn\u2019t even pay for them, I gameshare with a friend so I didn\u2019t pay at all. That was back when I was broke though but now I can buy games to help repay him.You can still absolutely do that if you're really quickyea it was called closing your 3ds c:True, but if you get to a relatively safe area you can just quit and pick back up exactly where you left off.I play mainly fps games so i would just have to leave the game i was in, and lucky for me tf2 doesn't punish you for thatNo, we didn\u2019t! That\u2019s the problem!Food wins everytime though. Continue playing and run risk of being grounded from game or get off game and get back on later.Thank god most parents don\u2019t realize they can kick a gaming system from the home network right from their iPhone lol. Yeah, I think it might have something to do with the perceived community when watching tv. My mom will always tell me to stop gaming only for me to proceed to sit on the couch and watch tv like everyone else. I guess she prefers it because I am spending time with the family.1998: son you're breaking the computer with your games\n\n2018: holy shit mom I think the botnet traffic is eating up your monthly bandwidth what did you do Oh 100%.  My dad hates video games to the point where I get nervous every time he walks by and I'm playing, even if I've only been on for like 20 minutes.  A few years ago he was trying to limit my time on video games to like an hour, and I told him that only having one hour for electronics was ridiculous.  He then said something like \"you can watch TV or use the computer, but only one hour of video games.  Idk what it is, I feel like the social aspect of being able to talk to your friends and connect with them over something you like should be better than binge watching Netflix, but I guess not.That is correct. My mom will tell me to stop gaming and get on the couch to watch tv quite frequentlyI used to play games with my dad for years until he stopped playing cause I got better than him/his hands weren't doing the best.Same here. I think dad's attitude towards alcohol is a fair portion of the reason I don't care to drink.I take comfort in both you and I knowing we can be at least 2 times better parents than what has preceded us. You think they know everything as a child, then you grow up, realize they know nothing really. You try to put yourself in their shoes, you find you could run a mile yet they take but a few steps. Not even anything you can do now, you can try to teach them but it's 20+ years too late.\n\nEven worse when you see how similar all these parents act. We could both paint a pretty similar picture of our parents I bet. Some way worseI think my kids already have.Pushing pencils buys groceries and pays rent. Be sure to tell your mom when gaming starts doing that -- I'm sure she'll drop all opposition and start playing herself.Those are the life achievements we should all strive for!Here\u2019s you diploma Those are the most important!! Really expands the character \u201cWe\u2019ll bang, ok?\u201dr/assholedesignReally? I've never encountered that. This is evilGive her a side quest! Have you gamers learned nothing?!The kind you see in craft stores and written on small boutique shops in old town areas?Live Love LaughI mean hes up at 2am playing video games so does it reallllly matterNext to The OnionMy Dad tells me about all types of random things he finds on Facebook. COME ON DUDE ITS FACEBOOK!Da comrade. It\u2019s most best. For old people I'm the type of guy who stops playing halfway between save points and never touches the game again as a result.Same with the 3DS. Just put I in sleep mode. Only problem is you can't let the battery die.Gotta be honest here: my mom and I got into a huge argument Saturday and she didn\u2019t say a word to me on Mother\u2019s Day. So telling her to fuck off would have probably gotten me kicked out of the house...Last time I played terraria some years ago the was an option in the settings to pause upon pulling up the menuYes, but you can save at any point during the game. There\u2019s no checkpoints, you just save and exit and it pauses while you\u2019re not playing it There's an option in the menu to have the game pause. autopausethere's an option to make it so you pause when you're in the inventory in Terris single player thoFor me, at least, it pauses when I open the inventory or press the escape key, just not when I'm looking at the map.You can just quit out. You can't loose 4 hours progress by quitting though.Doesn't going back to the home screen pause the game? That's what I do when I have to do something in the middle of a fight.I wish my parents told me things in advance instead of telling me in the moment, as if I might not be doing anything else important to me I agree,\n\nBut in my experience it was mostly because my mom decided she was doing laundry NOW! \n\nOr now was the perfect time for me to go call my grandmother or go get some fresh air. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is my ratio video games / fresh air would have been a lot worse had she just not picked up the phone when I told her not to!!\n\nMaybe I just didn\u2019t make a fuss when she actually had places to be..If you tell your kid \u201chey we are leaving in 30 minutes\u201d that gives the kid time. And now you have said 30 minutes. So you give that time. Not 10, not 15, not 20. \n\nIf at the end of those 30 minutes they haven\u2019t found a place to stop, then it\u2019s on them. But I haven\u2019t played a game I couldn\u2019t save at least every 30 minutes. That's true, but I feel like in this case it can also be the parents fault. You gotta tell your kid in advence, that he should be ready to go in 30 minutes or something like that. If the parents did tell the kid in time, and he didn't get ready, then yeah, the kid deserves it, power their console/CPU down. But don't just walk over and be like \"You, quit, now!\"Sure, but they wanted to make me do pointless stuff, like they once made me go to a church for some reason. I don't know why, they know I didn't believe in god, and I am pretty sure my dad doesn't either, or at the very least he has no problem mocking it as he was once telling me and my brother a joke by Ricky Gervais about religion. Not sure about my mum but I know she definitely isn't Catholic. my friend did this with his PS2. He'd play PS1 games and just leave it on for weeks at a time, he'd just turn his TV off. I grew up with an N64 and when we first got a Gamecube, I had no idea what a memory card was, I never had a N64 game that needed a memory pak. Our first game was Sonic Adventure 2 and I just played as far as I could each time. After about a month I said something to my parents and they must have asked someone because the next day they bought two memory cards, one for me and one for my brother. \n\nNow I'm sitting here formatting an old HDD from a desktop for my Xbox One lol.Oh. They were. \n\nThank you for solving this 15+ year old mystery that I somehow never googled lmao > and Super Mario you're thinking 33. \n\nGod dammit, it's only 5am and I already want to murder the internet.  Fuck I'm old.[deleted]Wait, I though we already covered this.MGS4 would like a wordPsh like I'm ever thinking that far ahead, especially as a kid.Thank you, this is actually really nice.I had to sell the van! I'll be back to van living in a couple years but yeah now my name lies.Eh, everyone does that to an extent in my experience, but as long as it's not habitual or causing problems, whatever. It did take us a little while, and a lot of communication, to have a system that works for us, largely because of exactly what you said.I didn't even know I needed to read this. Thank you.This is me boysEach side gets 1min. That\u2019s itYes, that sounds right. Sounds like you guys really put together a cool hangout room down therejust ***nUkeThEtOWn***This entire city must be purged.Breaking both your armsKinkyThe point is Comcast has made it super easy. No more going to the room with the router/modem and manually doing it. \n\nNow any narcissistic parent can use their phone to quickly turn off the internet whenever they feel like their kid isn't paying attention to whatever stupid shit they are yelling about without having to get off the couch. Those sound like good alternatives to a parent. You could replace internet with drugs and the situation remains the sameA quick coward. (Just a joke)It also had a dedicated pause button during single player, start left up a aaaaaand game is pausedYou're right - but ignoring my gf for however long that takes comes at too high a cost! At least with something like overwatch you can divert your attention or leave a game (I don't play comp) - whereas dying due to distraction on your nth attempt at a difficult bit in Dark Souls (when attempts take half an hour each) is too much.As u grew up realize it wasn't just food it was free food. The next generation of parents will lolI mean I game with my sister (we're adults) sooooooYou'd think a multi player game would be even more family fun than just watching tv. Except if someone has a blue shell and knocks you out of 1st place.....2028: Son I broke both my arms.Its cuz parents see it the other way arround. You being captivated and isolated by a computer is a big nono, but watching TV with tour family/ friends is ok. Thats what they think, while forgetting that now people game with friends and bingewatch TV alone.But then he's deflated afterMonster hunter does it, definitely. And I think maybe Shadow of War does, too.\n\nI had a phone call during an important cutscene in Monster Hunter and there was no pause, so I hit the PS button, took the call, and returned to find out that not only had the cutscenes continued, but the game was running as if I was just standing there.Nothing like a good ol NPC  escort quest to waste some timeYessir Eat Pray FuckOr next to a picture of a Minion.My mum's a fan off \"did you see Facebook this thismorning\"I did mum but I probably didn't see whatever it is you're referring to as every person's is differentSame or if i lost a save and had to start over This is true... its called Autopause, essentially opening your inventory pauses the game. Also the game can be saved and exited, which is effectively a pause. Only difference is when you open your world again, it starts you off at spawn and not where you left off, but you can always alt\\-tab with the autopause option on and your inventory opened.Kingdom Come.  Have to have an in game item to save.Not dark soulsTerraria sends you back to spawn and despawns bosses if you save and exit.If in the middle of a boss fight or combat, that\u2019s not a good idea, and with boss fights you are put outside the boss room with the boss back at full health when you load your saveNot on Xbox afaik.\n\n(Trying it now)\n\nEdit: Nope. It doesn't pause or stop the quest timer.\n\n(Damn you for getting my hopes up)Adult life is hard enough without having a kid, and especially without having to structure your entire life around your kid's video game whims.  [deleted]My mum still does this... My dad, more soDota2?I mean, that sucks, but you can't really call all that stuff pointless when your goal is just playing videogames.Funny how that one little memory probably 18 years ago could solve this equally old mystery for you xD\"Just eat with us your friends can wait\" \n\nOkay mom\n\n*proceeds to slam dinner in 5 minutes. \n\n\"I'm technically abiding by your request.

Luckily this style of game is making a comeback :)That's crazy. \n\nDo you ever play a match where no one actually wins?Throwdown in Nuketown?I will purge the unclean! [deleted]Yeah, I play with my brothers but it doesn\u2019t count as family time unless the mother is involved.Every damn threadIt's because for the boomer generation, watching TV *was* a social activity. Your family all got together to sit down and watch TV together, before or after dinner, for whatever show the family liked together. People talked with each other while watching TV. They see video games and see people sitting in front of a screen by themselves and to them that's not a social activity, especially after so many years of their kids sitting by themselves or with a friend in front of the TV playing a video game that did not involve a dozen or more other people from all over the world. To them, 'video games' is still something you do while you're sitting in front of a screen *with a friend beside you*, because that's what they've come to understand it as since the 80s.Just wait until she's having sex and walk in demanding random household tasks to be doneShe might become expanded though.Hmm, good to know. I always assumed that opening the console menu was like a forced system level interrupt that the game just had to deal with. \"Honey please walk the dog. He needs quality time with mama.\"\n\n> Quest description: The domicile familiar must exercise its beastly extincts. Accompany your four legged companion on a journey of adventure around the block.\n\n> Quest requirement: 0/10 squirrel assesThat's having kids.  They kinda follow you, but slower.  If you don't pay attention they'll wander off.  And they're fragile as fuck, and will take damage and die from just about anything.I wish my first child could be a minion.  Like right from the womb.Oh god, this was the worst. \n\nI haven't touched one of my all-time favorite RPG's in almost 10 years now, because i lost all of my saves after a Hard Drive crash. I spent many months, probably even years to raise my character above level 100, had lots of OP gear, skills, etc... Then one day the PC crashed and everything was just *gone*... \n\nLosing a savegame can really kill the motivation...All items that are dropped on the ground also despawn when you save and exit, so you don't want to do that if you're playing mediumcore and have recently died and dropped your itemsWhoa explainnnThey added a save on exit feature in a patch. (It then deletes your save after loading it the next time)There's a game called OneShot (really great btw) that you're supposed to finish in one run (hence the name) and only has like two/three save spots iirc. You can just leave it running though if you have to stop playing. But it doesn't let you save and close the game.Yeah but you can pause that game and saving wasn't exactly hard tbh [deleted]lmao what rings u even got, let those bosses heal ill still wreck emAs an adult if people don't give me notice I just tell them to fuck off. Hell all I need is a day, but if you're going to expect me to do something out of the blue you can forget it, I have other commitments, even if it's just sitting on my ass playing games with my friends online. I can plan my own life, I don't need to be rushed.I love Drawful for parties! Seconding the Jackbox recommendationMost result in checkmate or time loss... but sometimes a draw. I think my stats over the last 1,000 games were 50% win  48% lose and 2% draw.And then she pulls out the jumper cables. /r/nocontextSo did I. I was pissed.How fun would that be?Which rpg are you speaking of?There is no save button (actually, they may have patched on in, but at least for a while).  You had to either be at home or an inn and have access to the bed to save.  Or you could, after progressing the game enough and learning the right skill, brew a potion that would save when you drank it.   It also made you drunk.Resident Evil had limited items that you had to use in specific locations to save. Ah.  Haven\u2019t played in a while.  Still pretty hardcore.You sir have a dirty little mind don't ya.Sacred.\n\nIt's a typical fantasy Open-World RPG, developed by Ascaron, a company based in Germany. They probably took a lot of inspiration from Diablo, which led to some people giving Sacred the nickname \"Diablo - Made in Germany\". Unfortunately, Ascaron went bankrupt in 2009 and the license carried over to Deep Silver.\n\nIt's a really great game, if you don't mind the fact that it's actually quite repititive and you have to grind a lot... You spent most of the time exploring the world, killing enemies and doing various quests. The main quest is also optional for the most part, but required to gain access to certain regions. \n\nThere are two campaigns, each with its own world. Both worlds, while technically sharing the same world space, are isolated from each other and not connected through any paths or portals.\n\nThe game has 8 pre-defined characters, which you can't really customize in any way, except maybe name and character perks. Except that, Race, Gender and Appearance are preset. \n\nIt also comes with the New Game+ feature, allowing you to carry over your character into the next playthrough, complete with lvl, skills, gear, etc. \n\nIt's possible to make your character extremely powerful, because active skills do not lvl automatically with the character. They have to be acquired and improved manually. And due to the way the skills in Sacred scale, it's usually not necessary to keep them close to the character lvl. However, by doing exactly that, they can become *extremely* powerful! \n\nI still remember killing the final boss with a single hit of a totally overpowered skill...\n\nYeah, i really miss playing that game...[deleted]Kingdom hearts was like this. You couldn't save unless the game auto saved at key points or you actually found a save spotSo you don't *have* to have an item, unless you want/need to save immediately.Dark Souls with no pause and the fucking campfires. Not only that, each save counts against your final rank, as does \"pausing\" (time spent inactive on item screens).  The clock basically never stops, only resets from a save.And it was the worst thing ever. Fucking ink ribbonsProbably because they're sick of getting that item over and over again. Understandable.Yeah, but you could pause anywhere, even in a cutscene.At least you could just pause it and leave it turned on all night and at schoolWhat kingdom hearts game auto-saves? Yes, you could also buy the drink. It\u2019s an alcoholic beverage. It\u2019s called savior schnapps. If you had them on you, you can save the game at any point. If you didn\u2019t you had to go to a certain place in the game that prompted a save during a quest, rent a room at an inn, or go to a bed you could save in. Some beds you couldn\u2019t save as they weren\u2019t yours. Believe me though, it\u2019s not difficult to brew or buy them. They are kind of expensive early game but now I don\u2019t even bother brewing them. I just barter with the inn keeper or merchant to get a cheap price and it\u2019s much more worth it. I have so much money i don\u2019t know what to do with. The only reason I would brew them would be for alchemy skill or whatever it\u2019s called. There are some parts of the game where you won't have access to a bed. But there are autosaves that get triggered by game events.Dark souls constantly saves.  When you turn it off either by quitting out or just turning the console off you will start exactly where you were.Bonfires, do you even praise the sun?Honestly, I kind of liked it. It wouldn't work in most games, but classic RE is all about carefully managing limited resources in an oppressive environment. I get that it sucks when something comes up IRL and you can't save (at least it does allow you to pause indefinitely), but in normal circumstances it fits pretty well, and makes you want to push yourself a bit further, take a few more risks, rather than save every 2 steps which would ruin both the tension and the pacing.",

Do people wear microfiber cloths as clothes? Doubt it. NEXT!Why would it be any harder for them?Cleaning your glasses with a shirt is bad for themWhat's a nudistThis is correct. It's poor etiquette to sit anywhere without a towel.Anybody who wears glasses knows you can't clean them with a towelYa, but from experience, the towel ends up greasy from the larger than average amount of sun screen required to prevent tragedy.  Not very good at cleaning.  \n\nMe?  I keep a microfiber cloth in my wide brimmed hat ;)*hitchhikerhttps://imgur.com/C8vhXq8.jpgYou're a towel.This guy knows where his towel isSo this is what Douglas Adams meant\u201cDon\u2019t forget your bring a Towel!\u201d \n[-Towelie](https://youtu.be/mpRnqim9T5U)Don\u2019t forget to bring a towel!!/r/gatekeepingWhy be a nudist and blind?Glasses, hearing aids, braces, crutches, wheelchairs, and artificial limbs aren't purposed to cover exposed skin but rather to repair or to compensate for something otherwise not ideal.  I don't think having any of these precludes nudity.Do you know how to spot the blind in a nudist camp?\n\nCome on, it isn't hard.It\u2019s another way Tobias stays never nude.A question for r/rimworldSo you can go on the street naked but with glasses on? Neat.Great. Now everyone I talk to for the next couple days is gonna be mad at me because I\u2019m definitely starting all my conversations with thisEither way, they still make a spectacle out of themselvesWhat about contact lens, do they count?The real Shower Thought is in the comments.And you would want to wipe your glasses with that?Also, for drying off after baths and clothes in a bag in case it gets cold, or for the walk back to the car.I read too fast and thought it said shitting towelwouldn't it be more sanitary to wear the towel around their waist at all times so they don't have to hold the towel all the times ...... makes you think, don't itThis has got to be the stupidest thing. \"I REFUSE TO WEAR UNDERWEAR TO COVER MY ASS AND CREATE A BARRIER BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE SEAT, SO I'LL CARRY THIS TOWEL AROUND TO PLACE BETWEEN MY ASS AND THE SEAT TO CREATE A BARRIER BETWEEN MYSELF AND THE SEAT.\"\u201cHi Sharks....\u201d[removed]My glasses are dirty. Anyone have some foreskin I can borrow?What if they're a Jewish nudist?Or your penis.r/TIHII was gonna use my scrotum to do itAww man I got smegma all over my glasses.Tainted comment.You ever just wipe your glasses with your foreskin just to flex on circumcised nibbas?This. I never touch the lenses of my glasses with anything other than my microfiber cloth. The slightest touch from my finger makes them foggy, and using my clothes just spreads the fog around the entire lens.Microfiber cloths never actually seem to clean them for me, or maybe I don't know how to clean them. But they just do the same as clothes. I just use some glasses wipes with some type of cleaning chemicals in them, but those don\u2019t work all the time either. So I just wash mine with hot water and wipe them with a paper towel. It always does the trick.As an optician this whole comment thread makes me happy!  It\u2019s the first thing I thought when I saw this! LolSqueeze my terryfolds you son of a bitch[deleted]Just curious- is satchel style or backpack style more popular, or is it a mix?Yes, I too carry my nudity in a bag.you should carry a cloth in your bag, wiping with the towel you lay on or dry on is asking to scratch your glasses\n\nsame for phonesShouldn't talk about her like that. :)I used to carry my sack everywhere I went but then I noticed it was making people uncomfortable.So why are you doing this again? If not being nude is unnatural so is carrying a towel wherever you go.

Open reddit\n\n2. See this thread title\n\n3. Totally know what I'll see if I hit ctrl-F and type \"balls\"\n\n4. Yep. Here's yo comment. Take your upvote.Right in the ol prison pouch.If you wear clean clothes then they clean just fine in my experience.Can confirm. I only ever clean my glasses with running water and a couple drops of dish soap. Clothes only make them even foggier.It's probably because you use a lot of fabric softener.Ah yes, let me just keep a microfiber cloth in my ass>  most people who wear glasses  tend to carry some cloth specific for that \n\nno, most people use t-shirt[Sure](https://www.amazon.de/STRYVE-Sporthandtuch-Handtuch-Rutschschutz-Fitnessstudio/dp/B07Y8X3VTK). It even has *magnets*, so it's easy to attach somewhere metallic. It's just perfect! Btw, the linked towel was invented by some Germans, a country famous for [its \"free body culture\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism#Germany). They say it's very good for the gym, but it's also very good for going to a nude location.That's worse then being nakedButtholeUnder the doormat...Beach bag, just like everyone else.Typically, you would use your shirt to wipe off your glasses if they get smudged or foggy.Nothing to clean them off with. Usually people use their shirt.This might be someone who cleans their glasses on the go with the edge of their t-shirt or a wipe or small cloth kept in their pocket. Stuff a nudist wouldn't have on hand.Am chubby, can confirmWipe it to your ass it'll make your ass smells good like a cheetosOtherwise Big Hankerchief goes out of buisness, right?That depends on if you view glasses as clothing or medical assistive devices.A personDoes anyone ever take a shower and then accidentally dry off with someone's ass towelNot only for sitting, but as Ford Prefect said, always have a towel with youMight almost be easier to wear clothes like everyone else.Nor most clothes either. I always carry around a microfiber cloth only for my glasses.Wth does \u2018You\u2019re not a nudist if you didn\u2019t bring your hitchhiker\u2019 mean?Depends on the people around you, I\u2019d guess.How do you spot a blind man at a nude beach?\n\nIt's not hard.The same reason a nudist must be sunburned.They could just wear contacts? Would that be like... nude glasses?Attractive people are rarely nudist.The subtitle to my autobiographyI have only had one experience, but the one nudist beach I was on I would prefer the blindness. A hefty percentage of them are people you would prefer not to see nude. Also lots of children. Felt super uncomfortable.\n\nAnd if I\u2019m being honest you wouldn\u2019t want to see me nude either.From what I hear about nudist colonies, I'm not bring my glasses.  I can be naked without having to be constantly reminded of the effects of gravity.If you've ever been around actual nudists you'd wish you were blind.I just imagined a nudist getting lasik.Why wear clothes if you\u2019re blind?Doesn\u2019t being nude make you blindA budist...Vegetarian vs veganBlind exhibitionist?The blind usually wear sunglassesWhy be blind and not nude?Its a super power so you can't get an erectionThat's the only place that I would prefer to be blind.  In fact I think I'll grab my glasses and go feel my way around a nudist colony right now.Smell-o-visionWhy pretend like clothes are a burden and glasses aren\u2019t? If you\u2019re gonna be an idiot, go full idiot lolTis the questionMy clothes compensate for something not idealJust googled.  Nudists in Florida wear sun hats and sandals.  The sandals protect against fire ants. They carry a towel for sitting hygenically, and that towel often has a pocket for keys and other small objects. The towel can clean glasses.Jimmy Carr?No pants or shirts. Hats are fine.Rosette tinted glassesOne side for the ground, one side for your ass. You choose which is better for your glasses.Do y\u2019all take up the whole towel when you sit at a beach?It just seems almost like an excuse to just be naked all the time.\n\nClothes aren't just fashion or expected by society. They're a functional tool for getting through the world. We didn't make shoes to hide our feet. It was to make walking less painful and more efficient. Our other clothes protect our skin.\u201cHi Dragons....\u201d*\n\u201cOh hi shark\u201dim doneSorry, I forgot to bring extrasr/brandnewsentenceO-o-O-o-H who can take my sorrow... maybe its inside the towel? Maybe its inside the toWUel?Happy cakedayUse the labiaBonus - if you rub it you could use it as a towelNo need to take them glasses off just lean down and let me rub it all over your faceYou keep the foreskin in your ass to use it when neededDoes people with foreskins count nudist tho?A Jewdist?Didnt you see those foreskin tablets posted on here a little while ago?[deleted]Make sure you\u2019re cleaning them wet.  Don\u2019t use hot water it can strip the coatings.  You should\nBe able to use a little blue dawn soap and water.  Getting the stuff for anti-reflective glasses is best and keep the cloth clean.  If you\u2019re using the cloth only you\u2019re not getting them clean really.  \nNever use Kleenex or paper towels or toilet paper.  Those are made from paper and they will cause micro scratches which can lead to your costing peeling.  \n\nI work at a glasses place and I\u2019ve worn them since I was 3.  My mom also does this for a living and would get so mad if I cleaned my glasses with my shirt lolSuck my flaps you piece of shitI wanna take you to the terryfold dance.You're way too polite to be a Rick. Are you sure you're not really a Morty in disguise, or..... a Jerry?You\u2019ve got some big squanchin balls showing your face around hereDepends on where you go and what you plan is. I grew up in a nudist family and went to a nudist camp in France each summer. When going to the pool just a basic cloth groceries bag and towel, beach maybe one small backpack for valuables like keys and a bit of cash for icecream. The person carrying usually wore a tshirt.\n\nSatchel bags are not used often for various reasons. \n\nNormal *set* you would usually see: cloth bag with sunscreen some snacks and water, towel and often a sunshade.So... an empty bag?Because not wearing clothes is awesome and significantly more comfortable.I'm too foolish for the platform *sigh*Pretty sure I\u2019ve seen this \u201coriginal\u201d thought at least three times.They've always made it worse for me, regardless of how clean the clothes are (like, literally right off the drying rack and they still manage to cause smudges).Hmmm, could be actually.Or you could just keep it in your bag :pI have glasses myself, if I use any cloth to clean my glasses, it may appear clean but there are smudges and it's irritating to see that smudge on lens when you wear it.Always the latter.  Outside of costuming, nobody wears glasses just as clothing.Not in my experience. Showers are usually in your own room, not in public.My dad uses the hand towel to dry off.We don't dry off, at least not at outdoor resorts[deleted]Just don't panic and keep your towel handy and you'll survive anything the universe throws at you.You can clean them with anything made of cotton.Nudists bring towels. It\u2019s the etiquette for sitting anywhere.You're not a hitchhiker if you didn't bring your towel.  \nIt's from hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.Other way around: you're not a hitchhiker unless you bring your nudist.Can confirm.The real insight is in the comments.Yeah, when my sister is around me, I always wear my glasses.because they're a witch?depends how high you set the bar for attractive\n\ni'll grant you that most people look better with clothes on than offMagnets have \"issues\" as wellLeering, and finding faults in appearance is the exact opposite of the nudist movement. It's about being free with who you are inside, and out.Yes: exposed skin.  (Edit: which I also always wear and for the same reason.)[deleted]But they had their balls on that towelPink tinted eyes.\n\nEdit- hey! Thanks for the silver, whoever you are. You're alright. \ud83d\ude0esephia tint. if you got rose tinted glasses and you're a guy, see a doctor. if you're a girl, check a calendar before needing to see a doctorThe side facing up on the portions your ass didn\u2019t touch. Unless you skootch your anus over the whole towel like a dog with a rectal itch, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find a clean spot.One side for asses, one side for glasses.I have chosen a side, and since I\u2019m going to stick with my decisions. I now have permanent pink-eyeI do you one better. Folded in half, inside is for glasses, one side for ground, one side for ass.just like a hat, a turban, or a scarf isn't just a status symbol, it's sun protection for the head.I don't consider myself a nudist, but I'm always naked at home and I prefer to be naked as far as is practically possible. What is the cutoff point?*\\*looks back at both of you in Kevin O'Leary*I ate mine on the way hereTeacher says you have to bring enough foreskin to share with the whole classIt's fine I'm wearing mine as an anklet, you can borrow itAre you a biblical King if you usually walk around with a bag of foreskins.Good ol\u2019 prolapsed anus to clean a pair of glasses.It\u2019s like a turtleneck for your dickDoing the same with a microfiber cloth instead of a towel to dry it should help the scratching a lot. Like I said to the commenter below, you just have to wash out or replace your microfibers occasionally if they get too full of oil.>  Getting rid of that oily stuff is a nightmare\n\nTo comfort you a little bit, my skin is anything but dry and getting rid of that natural oily stuff is a nightmare too. \n\nThe only thing I am able to clean the lenses with are the special pre-soaked wipes for glasses (I guess a combo of a special cleaner and a microfiber cloth would work too).[deleted]Yeah, that you fill with your clothesNope, bag full of flesh.I'm getting used to it myself. It just goes to show how unoriginal human beings really are. It's nothing to be that ashamed of. We're survived in part because we're so unoriginal and copy each other all the time.Depends greatly on the material as well, works great on most of my tshirtsIt\u2019s because the grime on the glasses is too thick. I always clean my glasses with soapy water first. Then I wipe with some soft fabric. T shirts work great.My bag doesn't open unless I cut it with a knife, then I have to deal with the bleedingIf you wear a bag, are you really a nudist?when i use my cotton t-shirts, i dont have that problem, sure its not perfect, i shouldnt do it as i know it scratches the lenses, but i just dont ever have that little piece of micro-cloth on meExcept for that one trend that, thankfully has died down, when all the hipsters and emos were wearing fake glasses for fashion. God, I hated having to explain I actually needed my glasses in high school.That's kinda funny that someone would think that nudists just all gather under a communal shower... like it's prison or something.Do you ever have to do a smell test to determine which side of your ass towel should be touching the couch\n\nEdit: if y'all had as clean assholes as you like to pretend, you wouldn't need an ass towel in the first placeLook at mister money bags here with his private showerDo nudists also use toilets in private or they do it openly?What is your towel made of?I forgot bc I read the books ages agoNo wonder you\u2019re angryStep dad is that you?dad, is that you? did you get the milk yet??I don\u2019t know I feel like nudists have plenty of insight/r/HolUpDoes she float?Can confirm. I look much better with clothes on. I look even better if you are wearing a blindfold.You also always wear exposed skin?[deleted]Found the hypebeastWhat's the joy in being nude if you cannot freely perform a rectal itch confidently in the wild?Well done. You wear that diseased eye proudly. It tells the world you've conquered it's pitfalls.And sand protection in some cases.Doing anything physical outside of your home where your skin must make contact with the earth or other physical objects.\n\nI love being naked when I am home. But its way too easy to damage your skin outside.You win my love and affectionGet out of here, Jerry.Ehh, all creativity has a source. Creativity is all about manipulating what you know about in different ways. Though that\u2019s different than blatantly ripping someone off.\n\nBelieve Albert Einstein is sometimes credited with the quote, \u201cThe secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.\u201d And of course, simply being associated with that quote makes some people think he\u2019s hiding how he stole all his work from his wife... world is weird.Yeah that's true. Also the type of dirt that's on the glasses also makes a difference too. I don't know, maybe I've just been put off by the few times it's not worked out well. Not to mention that I'd rather not also make my clothes dirty :PSee comment in other comment about how bags aren't made to cover your body and so yes, you would totally still be a nudist if you have a bag :PThat was actually a thing? I thought it was just a meme or something.People really don't get it until you experience it. Most nudist environments are non-sexual and no different than any other resort or campground, other than you don't have to worry about current fashion or wet bathing suits. Honestly, nudists are some of the most genuine, least judgemental people you'll ever meet. It's almost as if clothing is a barrier for opening up to others. Once you have nothing to hide behind, it's much easier to just be yourself, without any pretense or expectations.Most nudist places I have been to do have a communal shower.Well they do have walls to keep them separate from the nn.Prisons don't have communal showers. There are individual shower stalls right in the dayroom, with doors that only extend from shoulders to knees.Primarily outdoors so no couches.I feel like the rule of thumb is; If your towel smells like your asshole AFTER a shower you need to clean your asshole a lot better.You won\u2019t have that issue if you shower...steel woolBut there was a movieHey they\u2019re surrounded by the comfort of family they\u2019ll be fine.truth be told, i was at a nudist campout, twice, and some people are not easy on the eyes. hence my ability to confirm lack of cleaning opportunities for my glasses - which, in that case, was just fine by me..possibly. let me check the crew manifest...not without glasses they don'tLike wood.Only if she weighs as much as a duck.Throw in some handcuffs and I'm there, DaddyTragically, yes.I live so far from civilization that my local Walmart doesn't carry Exposed Skin\u2122.  You're lucky!r/brandnewsentenceUnder nail poo.I hate sandThat\u2019s what it takes to win over your love?On reddit you can hide in plain sight, I guess that's the beauty of it.Nope. It was thing in the early and mid-2000's, at least where I live.Yea that's cool and probably very enlightening in a sense [but...](https://tenor.com/U5RJ.gif)https://youtu.be/_bBNyxqym-8Are you saying that there's nudist environments that \\*are\\* sexual? Asking for a friend.\"I've seen you without your clothes on... Never thought I'd see you naked.\"The wet bathing suit thing is real for me. I wonder if there is a nudist colony where you wear clothes everywhere except between the hot tub and your room, and you just use a towel wrap. \n\nIf it is late at night, I do this anyway, but I feel like I\u2019m going to wind up on a list or something.That makes sense and while I've never been to a nudist resort or community, I can see the appeal of the freedom. My question is, is there an orientation so that newbs can learn all the etiquette stuff? This is a situation where I imagine there are a lot of rules and guidelines. It'd be mortifying to screw up your bench sitting or food serving in a nudist social gathering context.Yup, can confirm. Almost every nudist places I\u2019ve been to in France had communal showers.Okay thank you, ass towel dynamics are intriguingHell yeahFor that frosted lookI didn\u2019t watch itLet's just hope he's not in a porno.Are you using a plural pronoun as a gender neutral singular for someone who's name already implies male gender?If the witch has wood it's a wizard.Stiff as a wood is how I felt last time I went to the nudist beachCan we still build a bridge out of her?Whose exposed did you wearYou really shouldn't be worried. I was worried at first too, but in most places no one is looking for sex. You really start to understand that the only difference between a boob and an elbow is the sexual value we place on it. Without that energy, everyone's skin is just skin.\n\nBut if you do get a boner, just get in the pool. No one sees it under the water.that was a risky clickI would give u a gold if I could...My dude. Best show ever.I shouldn't have watched it.\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afThey're means They Are. Not pluralThey is a singular pronoun. It\u2019s been singular for like centuries\"They\" is not inherently plural.If the witch has wood they\u2019re kicked out of the nudist colonyA witcherThe worst imaginable: my own.>  You really start to understand that the only difference between a boob and an elbow is the sexual value we place on it\n\noh I understand it, its just that I put a LOT of sexual value in boobs.Even when you get a boner, there\u2019s nothing wrong about it. It\u2019s normal and most importantly it\u2019s context dependent. Sexual-non-concordance is something many people don\u2019t know about, so they shouldn\u2019t judge about an erection in public either.Have been to hippie hollow in Austin 10 million times, this is true.  Also really helps with your body image issues to see we all have bumps and scars and skin and rolls....nobody is perfect and we're all perfect too.This is some solid advice.Well there is a different number of nerve endings in the nipple than an elbow, which is kind of why we place that value on itHow do you get to be in a nudist colony? My gf and I are basically always fully nude when we can be because we hate wearing clothes. We even have a couple of friends that will join us if it's kosher. Nothing sexual ever happens, nor do we want it to. It's just....freeing.\n\nWhere do I sign up to be nude in public?It\u2019s a good movie once you accept it\u2019s a different interpretation of the story in the book. \n\nStill isn\u2019t a great movie, sadly. But it becomes good rather than disappointing.The movie surprised me so hard. I thought people who didn't read the books would hate it but that's absolutely not the truth. Personally my biggest problem with the movie is that i don't like Movie-Marvin, he is nothing like the Marvin i had in my head.\n \nBut i always have a good time rewatching it. Usually with people that haven't seen it yet and they generally seem to like it all the time, which is surprising because i always wonder if it doesn't feel incredible chaotic and illogical.\n\nWhen i want the real experience i just randomly start reading somewhere to enjoy the audio books.you lost a limbyeah they're just asking which context they're talking aboutGone_WildHuntIt's hard to make someone understand without them trying it for themselves. You can find a woman very attractive without necessarily being turned on. It's as if the part of your brain that judges attractiveness and the part that turns you on were most of the time linked to each other, but they don't really have to be, and they each are their own.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are naked most of the time we're alone together. She can turn me on in 2 minutes with the right pose or the right touch, but otherwise it just feels normal, I'm not turned on like when I was a teenager and merely thinking about breasts. I can ever caress her without being turned on. But the moment I let the switch be flipped, then the caress activates something. \n\nIt's simple, we get rapidly deprogrammed to make nudity mean sex fairly rapidly if the context isn't sexual. The programming may never completely go away, but I can almost guarantee that you wouldn't have an erection the whole time even if you were surrounded by very attractive women.So if I'm just rock hard all the time in a nudist area, people won't think it's weird?I think it's important to distinguish that if you're just walking around with a boner just out there for everyone to look at, you likely *will* be kicked out. That kind of conduct is a huge no no as these places usually have families and kids.\n\nIf you're just getting into nudism, understand that there is a code of conduct that you should follow. A little self-awareness goes a long way in making sure you're not making others uncomfortable around you.Idk man, that funny bone has hella nervesFingertips have more nerve endings than any other part of the body besides the tongue, so I doubt that number of nerve endings is a valid reason to classify a body part as sexual vs not.[deleted]I have issue whenever multiple books are condensed into a movie, especially when the miniseries was so damned perfect. I think I couldn't get passed the characterizations of any of the main characters, as I had a very clear picture of each from both the books and the miniseries.People who complain because \"it's different than the book\" should realize that the original version was a radio play...I love the movie and I read the entire series. It\u2019s just as goofy as I wanted, and I\u2019ve seen it multiple times over the years, still believe it holds up!At least it\u2019s only one, not both",

Not getting marked so you don't need to worry bout making a mistake \n4. It's not going toward your grade \n5. Dosent have to follow TEEL or any structure \n\nIsnt that what those essays prepared us for? Where are u on the internet where people shitpost with citations and which format do they typically end up using? The power of being interested Social aspect. Your essays are seen only by your teacher. Social argument online is your last battle for life, likes, popularity and influence. One is forced, another is about something you like and willingly do itThis is actually a great incentive for students to write. I had an ethnic history professor one semester assign an 8+ page research essay and instead of giving us all the same prompt and leaving it to us to figure out the rest, he let us CHOOSE whatever we wanted to write about as long as it pertained to the structure of the class. I was an art major and wrote about visual propaganda/cartoons/music used to combat systematic oppression, a die-hard GoT fan student wrote about historical mirroring in Game of Thrones. We both went well over 8 pages and it was incredibly engaging. That is not Correct! BecauseAccordingToTheEncyclopediaOfliudfbshkudjbvnjlbiefwjkbhj[deleted]it's almost as if people dont like being forced to do something they dont like I don't like writing essays on the internet but always loved writing essays in school.\n\nCheckmate.PrioritiesHaha no I won't\n\nSource: fuck youI\u2019m great at writing essays. The problem I ran into in school is that I didn\u2019t give two tits of a rat\u2019s ass about the shit I had to write essays about 95% of the time.  \nThe only time I wrote good essays was when I could choose my own topic.  \nIt\u2019s the same way online; I\u2019m not going to write out a massive argument unless it\u2019s something I actually care about.  \nPassion is everything.  \nIt\u2019s the same way with reading. I love books, I love reading, and I\u2019ve been a voracious reader since I was a very small child. But you better believe I fucking blew ass at projects about stupid bullshit novels like To Kill a Mockingbird and Great Gatsby.passion vs perfunctory bullshit. \n\nI regret attending and graduating college. It was not what I wanted to do and it has not helped me at all in my life. It has only hurt. College degrees are about as valuable as high school diplomas were 25 years ago. Unless you have a STEM passion just save yourself the money and frustration go into the trades.[deleted]Who is living under the mistaken impression that we learn to write essays so that we can write better tedious essays about shit a teacher or school board picked..? The POINT of being forced to write those essays is to empower students in the long term to do exactly this--go out and be articulate about the things that matter to them, in the real world. This is evidence of success, not failure. [deleted]Spite is a great source of power.Choosing to do something and being made to do something are two different things.People would rather write about something they care about than some nonsense that doesn't matter.With sources?! Where can I find these type of discussions? I always tell my students to join Reddit and their writing skills will increase dramatically.Omg, this is literally me. Stayed up all night writing a five page essay defending something just to win an argument.because it\u2019s something they actually are passionate aboutYou're just assuming these two groups of people are the same.\n\nThe obvious is that people who are in the first group are most likely never in the latter group, and vice versa.One is forced & the other is by choice  it\u2019s because people hate writing about what they\u2019re told to write. it\u2019s more fun if it\u2019s for your own personal desiresYou don't choose the subject you're writing an essay about..If I'm told to do something then I'll probably hate doing it.It's easy to write about a subject you hold a great interest in. Most people aren't that interested in the specific topic, or at least the topic criteria required in an essay. Which makes procrastination much easier.It's the thrill of the fightThe arguments people have done while arguing over anime characters is fucking crazy. I've seen people trying to calculate goku's power using fucking physics to prove their point.Have we been getting Mr. Miyagi\u2019d by internet comment sections this whole time?Because one thing is more interesting the other is notIt\u2019s all about passion. Its a battle not a gradeAt school you\u2019re forced to write about things you don\u2019t give a crap aboutThe difference between being forced to, and wanting to. I wouldn't say that it's school students that write paragraphs of argument replies. I delete most of my comments after like half a sentenceThe essays we are given at my school arent that big of a deal but i still hate doing it cuz im lazyNobody checks you onlineEverybody press F for my college GPAShit thats meOne is for a topi which actually interests you, the other is about the meaning of the second line of a 250 year old poem which i will never ever again see.I have an essay due in 12 hr. It's only 500 words but i have been procrastinating for too long.. helpEverybody is pointing out that the difference is passion. Same goes for reading. I feel like school kind of ruined reading for me. No high schooler is interested in The Grapes of WrathYour not being told to argue with someone over something, For me at least it's the fact they say to do it.\n\nLike when you're going to take out the trash and someone says for you to go take out the trash, then you suddenly don't want to do what you were already doing. Or is that just me?What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. \n\nI am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. \n\nYou think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. \n\nI can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. \n\nIf only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.\nMaintaining good grades < Intellectual superiority on the internetThis is why I used to form all my essays rough drafts as arguments or debates, it was amazingly easy to write 10 pages - fueled on coffee late at night. From there on it's just trimming down and sources. (\u0e07 \u0360\u00b0 \u035f\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\u0e07 Teacher: ww2 was a lame war and had no significant outcome on the world...change my mind\n\nStudent(s): submits thesis.\n\nTeacher: omg it worked.It's all about personal motivation, and the difference between work assigned to someone and work created in someone's free time.it would be called a \u201cpreferred activity\u201d in education.\n\nif someone does something they enjoy or are intrinsically motivated to do (specifically, when they are given a choice between different activities or assignments)  they will often apply more effort.Would you rather write an essay using sources from a boring article from 1996 or an essay on why cheese wedges should be cheaper in Skyrim?It feels more rewarding to win an argument online than getting an A+ and that's a fact. of course. how else are people suppost to know how stupid they are :bIt\u2019s only fun when it\u2019s on your own timeCan confirm.In 5 minutesNo I won't. My sources are my ass and my imaginary expert friend's ass. We need to have a will to learn, not force-feeding us dumb shit like \"the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\"Yes but we do get the satisfaction of proving someone wrong And if you recall my reasoning in chapter 2 of my argument .....If only schools would let you use an internet argument AS an essay since the methodology and the literal actual lesson trying to be taught is being appliedIn school your essays had to be coherent, organized, and well researched\u2014 with sources.  Online, you get bonus points for doing none of those things.Here is how I can demonstrate. I support our president Donald J. Trump. no i wont, \n\nand here is why...\n\n(12 Paragraphs cause i can)Cause you never know the feeling one gets after winning the Argument, as said by you. There is no fun in school to write. Marks doesn't intimidate me. But Wining something FROM. Someone does feel good. & You all know that human species is the most evolved species in the world world (as listed by a fellow intellect, genius man called as scientists) . So we feel good after winning the Argument.Well yeah, I\u2019d rather write paragraphs about video games than I would the life of William Shakespeare This is me.that the other person  probably wont even readIf my teenage son could write school essays about gaming strategy, he'd be able to write voraciously.But then they have motivationThis is because when people write those paragraphs online it's usually because if something they care about in school on the other hand you usually don't care about the stuff you are writing about.If schools gave the students more freedom on what to write about and/or what they learn in general instead of just doing a cookie cutter curriculum to create clones, surveys would be a lot more excited about school.\n\nJust as an example, when I went to school for IT, one if the first lessons I remember, was about what you needed to know to work as salesperson/in store help at a computer shop, I was so freaking annoyed at that lesson. I wanted to code, troubleshoot, fix, manage, develop software and not sell some overpriced hardware to some computer illiterate peopleIt\u2019s about what they like. Why donuts are bad may be more interesting than the Cold War to them.It's all about the topic. Ask me to write a ten page paper about the advantages of electric vehicles Iver gas and I'll be all over it. But ask me to write one about chocolate chip cookies and I'll drag it out till the last day (source: just wrote a ten page paper about chocolate chip cookies for school)a 10 paragraph (which would be maybe like 2 pages) argument online about something you care about is a lot different than a 2000 word essay you _Have_ to do about some boring topicIt\u2019s not the same people Practice. No they wouldn't wtfI use wrote a paper on the crust that forms on the outside of a vaginaMostly people just tell me to do the research to support their arguments. \n\nLike bitch no.I wanna write essays in school, (lowkey beetlejuicing) but all we do is analyse stupid shit.Pretty sure those kind of guys like to write essays in school.Duh, they actually care about that topic.Context. There's no excitement or passion when writing an essay for school. You're just writing it because you HAVE to.School essays fucking suckWell yeah, school essays usually don\u2019t have fun prompts or things to write about, it has to be in some type of format/MLA style, you have to have works cited...there\u2019s just too many things that make it less interesting. That's exactly the point of writing essays in school, to prepare you for this moment.If it's an essay about a strong opinion I have or related to a strong opinion I have, it's usually more enjoyable. Doing something you're passionate about is always more enjoyable than doing something you don't care for.School work is bland and boring, destroying your internet nemesis with a well written and sourced thesis. only to show your smug sense of intellectual superiority, over someone you will more than likely never meet, is the best feeling ever.Typing doest hurt your fingers, unlike gripping a pen, which can cause your finger to be crooked. Believe me, my sister has a finger that is somewhat crooked (not noticeable at first) from over excessive writing That\u2019s because they\u2019re important god damnet!!! \n\nMan\u2019s gotta have priorities!!! That\u2019s because schools fail to harness the power of passion and curiosity. Or schools will always be inherently flawed as long as people are forced to go. [Throwback to that time I wrote a four paragraph response to someone calling me \"fucking stupid\" for asking for people to use the spoiler tag.](https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/b4iuhh/can_we_all_agree_to_not_post_spoilers_for_the/ej7om7u?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)Imagine the essays a teacher would get if the prompt was, 'find a comment that made you angry online and dismantle it point by point with reliable sources'. Would probably be more fun to read as well.Part of it is interest. I decide when someone or something ticks me off enough to write a max limit comment response to something.\n\nThe other part for me is not caring as much about the judgement, or at least caring about it in a different way. When I had to write essays in school, most of my thought wasn't given to the actual topic, it was given to worrying about how my teacher was going to grade it. My teachers were fucking petty. They'd take off points for just about any BS. So a huge amount of the stress of writing an essay for me was imaging all of the unfair ways my teacher would nitpick me to death over something I didn't even care that much about but which held a lot of sway over my life anyway. \n\nWhen I write a comment on reddit, if someone responds with grammar corrections I can just call them a grammar nazi and move on with my day. There is actual pleasure out of doing that, you feel like you actually achieved somethingYou choose the format and the position you are arguing for, you write about something you have had knowledge and opinions about beforehand and that you actually care for - all something that is lacking in school work. It is the same as with required reading in school - personally, I have grown to hate fiction and long prose, but with the choice of material, timeframe and conclusions up to me, I was able to find great enjoyment in many overly-long novels.Because I hate putting in so much effort just to receive a D-I'll gladly write a 10 paragraph essay about technology. Meanwhile, I would hate writing a short paragraph to argue about football or baseball.Yeah because thats something theyre interested in and care aboutPride is stronger than responsibility I can relate to this wholeheartedly. I do it for work all the time. When discussing best IT direction I'll spend hours creating flowcharts and collecting data to back my position. \n\nIt's because I care, I'm passionate about the topic because it directly affects me. I couldn't give two shits about how railway was constructed in the late 1800's. karma > gradesMotivation is the key. Theyre not gonna get anything rewarding for writing the best essay ever, but just a simple refutation of something obviously wrong on the internet gives you way more reinforcement. Shhhhhh, this was supposed to be a secret Most internet essays would get an F for bad spelling and grammar and obvious logic flaws, strawman arguments, etcBecause it's on a topic they actually care about.Internet points are at stake.More accurately:\n\n    works cited:\n    [1] Look it up yourself, you can find it literally anywhere!I care a lot more about Spider-Man comics than Old Man and the Sea.No I fucking will not.\n\nSource: I know meI grew up arguing with people online from a very young age and when I got to college l consistently got top marks on all my essays.   \n  \nI don't care what people say, trolling is productive. In high school I actually used a huge portion of a guys comment on an essay lmao.\n\nGood thing that teacher didn\u2019t check for plagiarism lol.Yeah, that\u2019s what good teachers try to replicate Not a shower thought. Hate is an excellent motivator. Ur goddamn rightI won\u2019t. I just call them a dumbass and I say that any negative reaction is just proving my point.yes. motivation is a strange conceptOne word... consent.Not an argument but if you get me to start talking about something I really care about we'd be here all day talking about how bad the crafting table reskin in minecraft looks and all the things it'll effect.It's because you're forced in school, but on reddit you choose. :)I hate how right this isDuhhhh you didn\u2019t know schools only teach essay writing so you can fight with people on reddit?Maybe thats how institutions should start teaching students. That just means they\u2019ve got to find better topics for their school papers. \n\nObviously some of the content is dictated by the curriculum but when you have the option, choose one of those online-type topics to write on. Fake internet points > good grades So true!\n\nEven though I debate people with different opinions online, I highly respect people who respond with valid scientific sources, even though I disagree with their viewpoints. I try to reply with sources in all my online debates, but I start losing all respect for the person once they start replying with Ad Hominems (personal attacks essentially).My biology teacher has these phrases he always says. I wrote an entire essay analysing the deeper meaning behind him and the phrases. I also write fan fiction that involves a battle between him and a character that I had I made up. The story is quite complex. There are twists and turns and a whole lot of sophisticated vocabulary that I have never used for school work. Both the essay and story are filled with inside jokes between me and my friends.I experienced this when I started university. I liked writing so much more because I had more freedom of what I could write about. In high school all our papers were on very specific topics, so much that I imagine that all of our papers were probably very similar. I can\u2019t imagine that would be interesting for teachers to read. Yeah, it's because we're interested in the subjects online, but never are with those boring school subjects.Some are willing to do whatever it takes when their pride is at stake.You just discovered how I achieved my doctorate. I argued online within my field of study. I literally had to edit down papers by pages in order to submit them. Everything is better when you're not being forced to do itThis is true on so many levelsOnce i wrote an argument in 20 mins 2k words but on my 2k word essay it took me couple of days. LogicI used that to improve my writing skills because in Greece's education system one of the things you have to do in order to be accepted at a university, you have to right an essay.\n\nI used to find controversial comments on YouTube about various subjects and respond with ridiculously long comments. I think I wrote about two to three real essays the whole year I was studying for the admission exams. It was a really tedious task. We're were supposed to write articles, speeches and stuff like that. Arguing with nutters on YouTube was much more interesting because they would respond and you'd have to come up with new arguments to support your position and structure it that way so that it'd more convincing. It was also a good way to spot logical fallacies and learn how to debunk them.\n\nIt worked quite well because I did really good on that essay. The only downside is that it became a habit that evidently I haven't been able to break since.I had an English professor once who just asked us to write a persuasive essay on any topic we wanted. I was amazed at how much I had to cut back on... I hate writing an essay but damn do I love talking about dogo's and why I believe there is a dog for everyone and how they can be beneficial to people. After everyone turned in his paper he let us know why he did this. \n\nOne, he hates reading the same thing 17 thousand ways... why not let someone potentially change his mind on something he knows nothing about and make him do more research into something. \n\nAnd two, every single student wrote about something they were passionate about, every single student met the minimum requirements and a good 90% exceeded it and encroached the maximum length limit. He showed that almost all of us had the ability to write about something we just had to find our passion in that topic. \n\nReally opened my eyes to my own abilities.This is why one of my teachers in high school would say just the most ridiculous things to provoke us into an argument. If you want people to learn a certain thing, troll them from the opposite direction. That's why schools should use that potentialPluto is and always will be a planet until it is blown up. I don\u2019t care if I have to write 100 pages. Me in a nutshellit comes down to choice... schools are there just to crush the motivation and passion out of students while the internet is where you can willingly go to ignore your parentsIt's because one of those essays matters. I think we all know which one.Expressing your own opinion vs expressing an opinion someone wants you to express. See the difference?If I put as much effort into my essays as I do in the pornhub search engine. I'd be going places.Especially when it's about religionI am passionate about optics \n\nI am not passionate about dickens.Pridepeople will happily eat food, but duck if i throw an apple at their face, jesus christ karenIt\u2019s different when your integritah is on the line. This just in folks! People like to write about what they care about on their own free will, not being forced to write about something random.I don't give a shit about what Shakespeare meant in the play Romeo & Juliet, but ill fucking roast your ass on why  the US can't afford to build a wall separating them and Mexico.People  will do anything for that extra DopamineOr people, more commonly, write 10 paragraph arguments based on nothing but opinion or popular myths and pass them off as facts in order to win an argument and cite nothing, or link to insane articles written by the same types of people in order to support their crazyness.\n \nI do see your point though. I just see more of this online than people actually developing sound arguments. Which is something they may be able to do more effectively IF they did those essays in school and learned basic construction of arguments and the requirement for a basis of fact. Just my opinion. \n\nHowever, I acknowledge that there are plenty of people who do argue things properly online with corrects citations and that is because a passion exists where it may not in a school essay. \n\n- this is coming from an English major who spends very little time on the internet and probably doesn\u2019t see near as much of it as other people commenting here. This is just based on what I\u2019ve seen. Interest. I don't mind writing, but if you *demand* I make a text a few hundred words long and force me to use some shitty topic that can hardly reach half of that without resorting to packing it with filler and replacing single words with multiple (for example, \"I'm going\" to \"I've been going\", just to be able to add an extra letter), then of course it's going to come out worse and only the bare minimum.  \n\nMeanwhile it's fun to have an honest discussion and difference of opinions, and when that's not the case, to show them when and why they're wrong. Of course that's not usually the case, more often than not they'll sidetrack what sparked the discussion in the first place and resort to only insults or outright lies, but the person also has to know when they're doing the first two and when they've already said what they had to say and is just wasting their time.It\u2019s not about learning, it\u2019s about sending a messageBut this is _important_. Someone is _wrong_ on the internet!Strawman argument and we all hated naptimes after lunch in Kindergarden..When the ego is at stake. Because online you actually have a chance to win while in school it's just luck wether the teacher likes you or not.Well if people online weren't wrong all the time I wouldn't have to! ^^^^/s Because onr is actually fun to doWe know our priorities.This is the beginning of a motivational poster. This is why I always give a grade on someone's rebuttal, so they fuck off. That's because I don't give a shit about Henri Bourassa.My issue with essays was always the word/page requirements. I always wrote a well reasoned, complete essay, and found out it was like half as long as the requirement. Then I had to go through the process of trying to turn my essay into an overly wordy convoluted mess that I considered objectively worse, yet met the requirement. Or just submit it anyways if I didn't think it'd effect my grade too much. I did that sometimes too.\n\nNow if this thread had a minimum word requirement of 500, I would absolutely not be making this post. It is because schools force you to make boring writing assignments when I would rather write about stuff that matters to meI feel like people generally dont cite sources in online arguments and just pull stuff out of their butts that they think sounds right.\n\nSource: noneWhen it's something ur interested in, ur gonna want to do it. Most topics in school spark no interest in people.And spend more time doing it instead of doing something more productive.I think we have the solution to improving the school system, guysMight be because school essays usually don\u2019t let you get away with phrases like \u201cyou festering cock-slime\u201d.Meh. I like writing essays to get a rise out of people. Went to a catholic high school and for an essay in my writing class, I wrote a 4 paragraph essay on welcoming the dark lord in the hopes of bringing down a society that worships the very things they call sins. Got an A- because I forgot to indent the 3rd paragraph. I feel personally attacked by this postI'm telling you English teachers just need to make each writing topic a debate between the class. Everyone would have an A.We live in a societyNot really, if I am losing in an online argument, I just tend to call the opposing side gay and delete my comments.You also forgot that peoples whole life will be dictated by those essays vs writing paragraphs online to argue arnt the same concept. But i digress, people do a lot of stupid shit easier School is telling you what they want you to think, while arguing on the internet you tell others what you want them to think.Isn\u2019t the point of school to prepare you for real life?coz writing essays might not interest dem... but winning an arguement seems juciy to many....Or\n.\n.\n.\n. \nin other words ...people do only dose things nd kick thier ass off... which they love to do Brother Because the first will be read, the second one will not.\nJust like this comment!Nah, people just hate being graded on their ability. We all know how to do it, we all dread it because we can all get the point across easily but hate having to fancy it up for no reasonNot once in school did I ever write an essay on something I cared about.  Okay, maybe once or twice, but I would have enjoyed those.Because there is no ~2000 word limit online for arguments And also correct our grammar because if there is one grammar mistake in that 10 paragraph,your arguement is automatically invalidIf essays for school were interesting and about something I wanted to write about, it\u2019d be gravy baby. If I ever went to university I would want to learn relevant things in class by a capable professor. Not be told to write essays constantly. I have a passion for learning things i'm interested in, not in writing essays about john doe playing with his hoop and stick.Thats why i have declared all of my professors trolls it\u2019s amazing what personal investment can do for a person\u2019s academic skillsThey\u2019re interested in one of them, not interested in the other.Because they care about the topic. If the teachers said \"write an essay about something you feel passionate about\" instead of \"write about this specific unimportant issue\", students would be willing to and happy to write.It's all about subject material. The type of things we had to write about on school were so stupid and boring. Like someone said, it's about passion. You could talk for hours about your favorite thing in the world, but you'd *hate* it if someone tried to force you to talk for hours about a topic you couldn't care less about. That's why you should always assign persuasive papers. Tell them to pick a topic they are passionate about and tell them to convince you pf their point of view. Some of the best papers I've read and written have been this way. Passion makes the difference, and a poorly structured argument online wont fuck up your GPA.Because I want to be validated by people I don\u2019t know because idk how to do that with people around meall about what youre writing about; id gladly wrote an essay about one of my hobbies, but would hate to write an essay about nasa (i dont like space science one bit)One is about something we couldn\u2019t care less about. The other is about something we really should care less about.who the fuck is willing to do that? ive never seen a ten paragraph long argument on redditComic book fans \u261dWell I know this isn\u2019t the point but I HATE writing with any sort of pencil\n\nIt\u2019s literally like my middle finger grows a bunion People care about online arguments. People don\u2019t care about schoolThat and writing fan fictionIt's like art class vs artists.  We don't hate writing, we hate being forced to write.Right off the back of people who hate reading books spend all day reading on their phone...I always write my papers with malice and scrutiny, this method makes school worth it....yeah, I did this a few day ago. In my defense, I am very passionate about my potential third game installments.I love writing essays for school, but I also love the second part, so your point still standsNobody wants to wrote a long essay about darwin or calculas, id rather write an essay on the topic of booty and why booty will and always has been and will be better than tits. Because you're not getting judged and graded on it and doesn't matter if you did good or not. Also no one wants to write a freaking paper on novels like to kill a mockingbird Ms. Harding.You\u2019re onto something here. You should start prototyping lesson plans that leverage this kind of motivation lol. Not even that surprising tbh. Take learning;\n\nI love to learn and will spend hours doing it when it is something I am interested in.\n\nIf it is something I am being forced to learn against my will? Then I will do the bare minimum and complain about it nonstop.It's almost like people are more willing to invest their time in topics they are personally interested in...Yes! I have also written enough on my favorite shows and characters to create a doctoral thesis, probably.Writing an essay on here benefits me and others. Writing an essay in school is against my will, and has limited benefit if any.The difference is consentI spent four hours putting together a post comparing the drafting histories of different NBA executives. No one asked, no one cared, but it was an interesting question to me and so I decided to answer it and had a blast tracking down all the picks and trades. \n\nI spent twenty minutes earlier working on geography homework and wanted to die. I could give less of a shit about the albedo values of different materials, that's boring shit.\n\nbecause we aren't told to do so Seriously? You're really serious right now? I cannot tell if I have sensory problems or if I actually just witnessed a statement with such an immense amount of sheer stupidity. You know, I have seen the most bizarre things from some guy in class jerking it to Ronald Reagan tentacle hentai, to people linking Chernobyl to penis-shaped aliens, but your comment is by far the most fucking idiotic thing I have ever had the kind of horrible fucking luck one requires to hear your stupid fucking post. From this point on, when I think of you, I will imagine a diseased turtle taking an enormous dump, with so much unbelievably large amounts of shit that all the protons inside of the methyl sulfide this horrendous crap contains spontaneously fuse into uranium-235 that I can use to shove a nuke up your sub-mental ass. You can write that off as an exaggeration but it is 100% true from the bottom of my already-empty heart. I legitimately think that you lack intelligence. I would say you're mentally unstable but then I couldn't blame the terribly ignorant fucking post on you. I literally cannot comprehend how amazingly dimwitted your dumb ass is. I have trouble understanding the laws of physics, space, and time as if all laws of reality have been devastated and disintegrated due to how dense you are. I could write a damn book on your lack of intelligence that is so long, one could read the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, watch the entire Godfather trilogy, and invent fucking time travel itself before it could even be published under a first edition. Half-Life 3 would be released centuries before I could finish the first chapter describing your purely pointless state of mind. I honestly cannot tell if you were abused too much or not abused enough, because you clearly did not go to school enough to get a proper fucking education. To quote George Washington, \"Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.\" In that case, I'm getting as far away from you as possible. Hell, I'm actually unironically considering moving to Macquarie Island just to be isolated from your brain cell-killing words for the rest of my now-miserable life. I would rather go insane from thinking about you to the point where I pull a Cast Away and consider sexual relations with a volleyball than actually spending time anywhere near you. There is honestly no other way of putting it; you're an irritating asshole who contributes absolutely nothing to this already dreadful planet. And that's saying a lot considering the fact that I've heard of carbon dioxide levels reaching 400 parts per million, Donald Trump becoming president, and toxic fucking comment sections that contain your stupid bullshit. And again I go, being confused by whatever quantum physics you are using to defy the laws of physics with your stupidity, to the point where I'm saying you are worse than yourself. I have nothing else that is most definitely as horrible as you to compare to except you yourself. How does that make you feel? Like a turtle taking a nuclear shit? I really don't have a single shit to give anyway, because you are living proof that there is no hope for humanity left. Really went downhill after that whole thing where Rome fell; that made a lot of people pissed off. But not as pissed off as I am after reading your stupid shit. No, buddy, if I should even call you that, I am not pissed off at your comment. I am FURIOUS. I am so furious that I will personally take that radioactive turtle shit myself just so I can rid the world of your baffling levels of unadulterated doltishness. You are more dull than oxygenated magnesium or even a samurai sword that hasn't been sharpened for a thousand years. And you better be glad that the sword is dull, because if it wasn't, it would be shoved up your ass just like the nuclear turtle shit. I am so fucking angry that even watching an Adam Sandler movie will make me happier than I am right now. If the Greeks made a god of stupidity, you would be the closest candidate to that fucking role. It's not a good thing when you're so fucking unintelligent that people like Socrates would get on their toga-wearing-ass knees to worship your dumb fucking ass. That's when you need to reconsider obviously pointless life choices. Read a fucking book for crying out loud, man! What the literal fuck is wrong with you? After this fiasco I will need at least 12 hours of building up sanity with my psychiatrist. After this she will need to prescribe Ritalin that I will have to take 5 times an hour just to prevent me from snapping because of your disgusting act of stupidity. Your post gave me type 5 syphilis, which I didn't even fucking know existed until I felt itchy dick. Thanks a fucking lot. That was sarcasm, by the way, if you're too stupid to understand what that is (you probably are). Is it even legal for someone to be enough of a dumbass to make someone experience these sorts of emotions? Witnessing your stupid shit was like crawling through the depths of Tarturus itself and Cleveland. I have no words to describe this unintelligible shit yet I have so many. Once more, a paradox caused by stupid turtle shit. I have the most uncomfortable urge to strangle you Edgar Allan Poe style, you evil-eyed, black cat piece of fuck. Put that on your fucking tombstone. For Pete's sake man, you have drained almost every last sane brain cell I have developed ever since my unplanned birth and made my life more unenjoyable than it has to be you fucking cholesterol-ridden shit. I already consider jumping in front of a steamroller whenever I look at my uglyass reflection in the mirror, and then you come along and do this stupid fucking shit. Making me think of turtle shit infused with uranium-235. I'll punch you so fucking fast the force of your damn teeth breaking will cause nuclear fusion to happen from all the damn kinetic energy and make you implode into your possibly nonexistent dick. You want to defy logic, I will too motherfucker. You're possibly the most ignorant piece of fuck I have had the unfortunate chance to stumble upon in the butthole of the internet. I hope that shittyass post was worth it because I am going to kick your shitposting ass if I ever cross paths with you. Eat nuclear turtle shit. I think a big part is English class makes citing your sources unnecessarily difficult. APA is the easiest but its still cumbersome. \n\nReddit makes citing so easy and clean. \n\nAlso  nobody on reddit cares if you cite wikipedia which is expressly forbidden in school. crazy what angry ambition can do to a personOne day, there was a man in a comment section talking about anarcho-capitalism who made a 82 pages-long pdf to prove the other that it was bullshit. Unfortunately, it's in french and despite me liking y'all, I can't translate it for you.It's all about what you're interested in, and when you've voluntarily researched a subject because you're interested in it, you want to feel like you know more than someone else.Sounds like Reddit. Man, I love writing essays primarily because I always find ways to fuck the teacher over. She gave us a simple prompt: \u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you\u2019re optimistic about and why?\u201d. I gave a documentary on the entire history of Respawn Entertainment, Apex Legends, Game code, game engines, and a whole variety of things. \n\nAnother one was like: \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite fantasy character?\u201d Jokes on her. I grabbed a psycho from Dangaropa 2 (great game btw), and she had to read five pages about the intricacies of a murder and how every part relates to the character. They probably think I\u2019m gonna shooting the school at this rateFormer English teacher here!\n\nThis is why I always taught students to find an issue or a topic they care about, because the will to engage the subject matter comes more naturally, and typically people develop better arguments for things they care about strongly.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the idea.I wrote over 2000 words about my disappointment with a video game in around 30 minutes, yet in that same time span I\u2019d struggle to write a single paragraph about anything else.Because APA and MLA are both annoying, I want to cite sources like Wikipedia does.\n\nOn reddit I can quote shit and just provide a link for you to find the info.\n\nCitation was created for the age of only books. We have the internet now, you can look up nearly anything.Because we are motivated to write about a subject where as in school we are forced to write about poetry, BCE or 19th century literature and pull some obscure reference or deeper meaning to which we can\u2019t even relate.Whoa, Reddit is full of GENIUSES.... it's almost like passion makes investing oneself in things easier. ... \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14Wait..... Is the point of a PhD NOT to learn to research and cite specifically to prove strangers wrong on the interwebs? Consent.Just goes to show that winning an online argument is far more important than the shitshow that is the public education system.That\u2019s because on the internet you argue about relevant stuff. Unlike at school where you have to argue about why we should use nuclear energy or some shit. Have you seen the poor grammar & spelling though. And let\u2019s not forget that college papers have to be written in MLA format or whatever. Ugh. People need to know that I am right and they are wrong.Yeah no this is trueThat's what there were preparing us fori think that is because it\u2019s something you want to do instead of being expected too for example for a price of religious studies homework i did about half a page but when we got to do a history essay about any event in history i did like 8 full pages so it really depends on the subjectFunny enough I'm on Reddit to get away from writing a history essay.I\u2019ve yet to see a long online response using sources that doesn\u2019t completely butcher said sources and completely miss the point. Most sourced comments are brief, because what they\u2019re linking to pretty much sums up the argument for them and usually disproves whatever bullshit they\u2019re replying to. I would watch out for the ones that are long AND sourced because there\u2019s probably a whole lot of re-interpretation. Ironically it\u2019s the kind of thing you see from Nazi sympathizers and flat earthers.On the opposing side, on the internet you have someone who is consistently attempting to argue against you, keeping the argument interesting, while at school, you are simply showing your thoughts on a subject with knowledge that your teacher most likely doesn\u2019t care.\n \nYes, I am willing to go ten paragraphs for this.I personally would rather write about something I'm truly interested in than why Frankenstein is the modern-day PrometheusAl least writing a well constructed essay in an argument online has the potential to change someones mind on a subject and make a difference in the world. Not like those essays you are asked to mass produce at school to please your teachers who don't bother to read and understand on topics you couldn't care less about.Those might be different peopleWell yeah no one's making me write about Jane Austin here lolThat's because at school some asshole you don't like gives you a subject you don't give a shit about and demands that you spend hours of your life researching this thing you don't care about so that they can tell you you didn't do good enough and give you a shitty grade on it.It\u2019s hard to write an essay on a subject you give zero shits about.Nope I usually just say fuck your mom and lose the argument I don\u2019t really care to win. You may have just discovered a new way to entice students to write papersBecause we all seek validity and importance in some way.Yes. Yes. A thousand times yes!Came here expecting a ten paragraph long essay. Any video game arguement ever.Unlike with school essays, you end up feeling so satisfied after writing an essay with facts when arguing with someone.I mean, if you think about it, it makes sense. If someone tells you your opinion is wrong and is being a butt online, you want to defend yourself. Essays are just boring for most people since it\u2019s something not threatening to their own opinion or something they like directly.Cuz no one likes losing.People hate doing things they don't like but will willingly do things they like, wowI don\u2019t mind writing a 10-paragraph essay for a topic I\u2019m interested inLast semester I took intro to sociology. We had an essay assignment that was \u201cpick a social issue you\u2019re passionate about and argue your solution\u201d but then said \u201call sources must be recent, no more than a month old\u201d like fuck! That pretty severely limits your choices, especially when any relevant scientific and research studies are unlikely to coincidentally have been released within the last month. Ended up with a somewhat weak article since I had to settle for a topic I really wasn\u2019t all that passionate about. Life goals of a millennial.That's what all those research papers in school were preparing us forGuilty as charged.I winTakes little effort to express your own opinion, but if forced to think about a topic, well, that there is a calorie burner. Because prideWith sources hahahaLife hack: copy paste your comments into your essays.I litterally opened a word document and wrote 2 pages single spaced for my last argument. Maybe next time I Ave to write an essay I'll pretend I'm arguing with some fucksock online. Arguments are selective based on your intestests, assignments are usually just handed to you.Because it\u2019s a matter of what I\u2019m forced to do to appease teachers vs what I am free to do in my own timeBecause I give a shit about what I'm writing about online. I couldn't care less about the literary effect of the inevitability of the main character's death on last month's reading assignment.Skill is nothing. Will is everythingThe ones that win are generally from someone who DID write papers in school, with sources, and didn\u2019t just complain the whole time. It\u2019s a valuable skill most don\u2019t have, and NONE of us expected to use in that fashion. Math, on the other hand, is something I\u2019m still waiting to use. Someday..More often, people will bullshit their way through online arguments, knowing they won't be graded.[deleted]And every argument ends with someone's source being deemed unreliable. I don't see how anyone can have the energy to go back and forth over Reddit. \n\n\nSource: eat my assholeThis is because when it comes to writing on something i care about, I can write all day, but if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t fully grasp or don\u2019t really care about it\u2019s slow and tediousI don't thing my incoherent ramblings qualify as an essay lmaoWhat a load of crap. I bet no one here, in 2000 words, could tell me about how the Industrial Revolution did away with cottage industry!I think it's safe to say those are not the same peopleWell yeah, one only determines my future and if I fail I\u2019m sure things could work out. However if someone is wrong on the internet.....Because grades vs wins Its a lot easier to write about why you're gay than why queen anne was gayMeanwhile professional news organizations publish stories at a 5th grade reading level and 0 citations or verified sources.If I was allowed to write essays about any topic I wanted with no rubric, I probably would\u2019ve enjoyed writing essays moreBecause essays have a subject chosen by the school, with some exceptions. Essays online can be anything you want. We\u2019re procrastinating I need to keep my pride it is the only thing I have leftIt\u2019s very much as though people do better at the tasks in which they see value. Probably not the same people.I wonder if there\u2019s an overlap between people who like essays and people who argue like this online, though.How do you know those aren't the people who did like writing essays?Because they are interested in writing that argument, useless essays will result in discouragement Essays are graded.It's all about being interested in what you're discussing.[deleted]Maybe teachers should start behaving like forumtrolls. Just get someone fired up with just a few words and then have them write an essay. Someone should do a study on this.I don't want to write my Thesis. I want to win an argument. Desire to do something makes a tremendous difference.Speak for yourself.  I once got docked *two full letter grades* for turning in a 10 page essay where two was required.  Then I wrote another couple pages basically telling the teacher he sucked.  My original essay was corrected to a 90% and he wrote back a page why some of my conclusions he felt were weak.\n\nIt was a pretty rad class that relaxed some of my more conservative views a little bit.  Class was called *The Economics of Discrimination.*  Literally an economics class on discrimination.  Obviously the class was biased but there were still some points none the less I had to concede. So your saying that if you force somebody to do something they will dislike it, but if they decide to do it on their own, they won't? How insightful.having to write an 8 page research paper on blockchain. Can agree hate the essay.HA.  Speak for yourself!You don\u2019t get clout with an essayYeah, because I fucking hate having to write about myself. How many interesting things can you really experience when for all of your memorable life you've only had two or three months of freedom each year?it depends on the decisionOne is forcedWhat if I told you that those are actually two different people...Because an essay for school is something that is assigned to you, you have no choice in the matter and more than likely it's on a subject you don't care about. Get into an argument online and now it's something you have a vested interest in, its something you care about. that's what professors should do to motivate students, read them internet comments that they know will piss them offit's because no one wants to write a paper about school stuff but everyone wants to rip someone else a new assholeNo. The people who own your argument online in 10 paragraphs are the same people who don't mind, or who enjoy, writing essays for school, because they are capable of thinking critically and know their essay will be good. For some of us, essay-writing was easy. Your dumb arguments are sticks of butter and our knives are hot. Do not try to conceal your embarrassment at being refuted with such weak psychological projection.Doing something for a reason you\u2019re invested in is always easier than doing it to merely avoid negative consequences. Both is probably the most potent combination though Being forced to write a paper with guidelines =/= writing an argument over something you care about. its all about passion It's almost as if... People will do something... If they like it.... And won't do it.... If they don't like it. .. D:. \n\nOr they just hate being told to do it. Was told to pick out two books and read them then compare them. Even though I love reading and those books, I didn't read them. <insert what the fuck did u fucking say about me copypasta>Protec teh repBecause I care if I'm taking the time to argue.It's all about passionWell, you get to choose the topic of the essays you write online.Not the same people.I think you mean 'Gamers hate... 'Teachers could state their controversial opinions and let students submit essays that argue the opposite viewpoint. Instead of assigning essays about topics that nobody in the class, teacher included, give two shits about. Because it\u2019s something they care about. People put effort into things that interest them.These are probably not the same peoplepeople hate writing for school because usually its a subject they have no intrest writing about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nonline they choose to argue about subjects they like to talk about and therefore its way more enjoyable to argue about it even though most online arguments turn in to a shitshow because the other side of the argument starts flinging shit when they run out of things to say.People hate writing executive summaries for business reports, yet will craft a tl;dr: of a long post that is so exquisitely succinct that you want to print it out and frame it.Its how i learned to type. Thanks r/magictcgNot meThats y i love persuasive essaysAnd I thank those people for writing my essays for school. You guys are the true heroes. I think you're describing two different groups of people.ye because winning an argument has a lot of satisfaction, what does school esaays offer?Mozambique here Different people i used to write long essay like responses to people who didnt like shion uzuki from xenosaga showing why they were wrong\n\nit never changed anyones mind at best they agreed she was well developed but still didnt like herYou get a trophy for that, so why not?Well that makes one of us...I wouldn't waste my time to write an essay about a stupid argument.Funny I did this just a week ago ahah some girl in my class actually beloved the government controlled the weather came in with a 4 page essay to prove her wrong.I love essays for school if i care about the topic. it\u2019s because it\u2019s not about RoBerT FrOSt or some bs poetIt's same logic as in the quote \"people run from the rain but sit in a bathtub full of water\". It's about consent. When something is forced on you, you don't wanna do it. That's cause arguing with people is fun. Even if you know what you post won't achieve anything some part of our lizard brain feels that it will. We feel like we can make some form of change when posting online but school work feels like it doesn't matter. So people put the effort into online posts and not their school work.Just shows you that education must start to be geared towards real life experience and enable the learner to be invested in something that is important to them. How many books and topics were you forced to care about?!ConsentI use them as papersSomething something consentActually there are only so many 'arguments' that would actually warrant a 10 paragraph essay on, and you can hardly call them arguments. But there was a research group in Ireland that found a direct correlation between being forced to do something and wanting to do something for yourself. There was something like a 34-42% increase in productivity. Cant remember the name of the project but im on my phone rn so give me a couple hours and ill get a link to the actual article after work.It\u2019s about taking pride in your workYes, because one topic they care about the other one they dont. It's the main reason most people dont try in school, they dont give a fuck about page long division with letters in it, it's useless, that's what post secondary education is for. all in the name of online street credSchool takes all the important things adults think kids should know and teaches them to hate those things.It's all a matter of passion and motivationEgo is a strong thing  The secret is, writing an essay about stuff you argue about online!Well , it's one thing to write something you actually enjoy and research , that also allows you to place your thoughts and opinion in it , and totally something else to write a few page essay on a book with arguments that are only valid if a critique said so ; also your opinion is called \"wrong\" and your mark is low , altough your argumentation was fineNo.That's why you post the opposing viewpoint for your persuasive essay and wait for someone to do your homework for you on /changemyviewWhere are you having your internet debates?Yea I wish my papers were 10 paragraphsHonestly, teachers have said this to me, but the difference is, if I am arguing with someone about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure that is something I care about. Usually when school asks me to write an essay on something, it has to be a topic they picked or approve of, and usually I couldn't give a rat's ass about it. These are usually not the same people.Because I don't give a fuck about the shit they teach in school.its like sleeping 10 hours and waking up tired for school to sleeping 2 and energized for some fun activityI fucking love writing essays, bitch! The difference, one is completely meaningless and the other is due tomorrow.The overwhelming majority of posts aren't 10 paragraph essays with citations. It's about consent Being forced to write about something and wanting to write about something make a world of difference.Its a lot more enjoyable if you choose the topic.Well that\u2019s because you don\u2019t get graded for quality and credibility online.\"It's weird how people do what they like to do and don't want to do what they don't like to do.\" What a shower thought. Why have so many of them lately been this bad?That\u2019s because they care about the topicSource?I'm passionate about not writing more than one sentence.Yeah school is boring and most topics suck, especially in English class where they have been making students write essays about the same dumb topics for 50 years. Whereas when your on the internet you are talking about your interests. People are passionate about what they are passionate about. Who wants to write a boring essay on issues that are obsolete?So I did my job then.\n\nLooks like we produce something after all...No joke, I\u2019m a beast at writing essays now because of internet arguments.>\u201cWin\u201d\n\nPeople don\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d or \u201close\u201d arguments on Reddit they just end up hating the other side even more.Its easier to write about something your passionate about. I could write essays about video games for hours but if i have to write a 12 page essay about prison slave labor with ties to your local community its gonna suck dick. Sub 2 PewDiePiework vs playBecause we care about the argument more?? Don't see how this is strange.\n\nIt's like saying, \"oh, people hate eating some food they dislike, but they eat a lot of their favorite food! Do they love eating or not??\"Lol no I won't. If you don't believe me then fuck youNo one is grading us onlineI have spent more effort in researching, editing, formatting, and articulating my comments on reddit for useless internet points than for what I submitted for school.

People hate writing essays because they need to. People can write so much online because they want to. Maybe because they enjoy what ever it is they are arguing about more than chemistry.I _wish_ that were true. Instead we have people that will absolutely not cite sources, will not talk coherently, but keep on babbling that they're right, even when presented with evidence that is against their belief. \n\nIf there are people who are typing 10 pages to win an argument with logic and reasoning, I say we fucking encourage it as much as possible.

The problem with school is that there are always such strict standards that say \"you need to write an essay about this,\" \"no you cant write about that,\" and \"no you need to consult this source, not that one.\" Thus, kids have no motivation or passion to write those essays, so they loath it, whereas with things such as arguements online, the person writing is actually emotionally invested in it and cares about it even if just a little, so they're more motivated to do it, do it good, and put effort into it.I used to like reading until it became punishment for school so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afWinning online is was more important than education your argument is invalid. How is this a shower thought? Don't you think about deeper things? When you actually care about something you'll obviously have the motivation to do it. ConsentI mean I hate both so I begrudgingly do one and just write short answers for the other (this might be the longest thing I have written I will need to check)At least in school literature essays, no teacher or other grader is going to look at your bibliography entry for the very novel you were required to read and cite, only to scream \"Fake news! Unreliable biased propaganda!\" before dismissing you from the classroom and giving you a failing grade.All schooling should be in the form of Reddit posting something wrongIncorrect, I hate bothConsentThese are often not the same peopleFor real though, 10 paras, sources that aren\u2019t what you could find in a five second google search? Nah, more like one overlong para and like 2 sketchy sources. I don\u2019t want to do either of thoseHow is this mind blowing. It\u2019s all about being passionate and caring about what you writeIt\u2019s because no one is grading the shit you post online. If you\u2019re writing an essay for school it better be right. People love writing and academia. People hate not being allowed to write whatever they want as true regardless of factWhy assume they are the same people?I myself have taken long reddit comments, fixed them only a little and subsequently submitted them as writing samples for a ghost-writing side gig. nopeMs.Holland is that you?

They'd much rather do something for themselves rather than because of someone else.Exactly. Do what you\u2019re passionate about. Yea I don\u2019t give a fuck about The Scarlet Letter, but if you wanna with me about basketball or politics, I\u2019ll write a novel.Pride.  Yeah, Even essays can be fun if it\u2019s something worth writing.Fun fact the original (or older) meaning of this word was to suffer or suffering i.e. Passion of Christ. Of course language evolves and words change meaning but this new meaning of passion appears to be so unrelated to the original. nimrod did the same thing going from the name of a great hunter to meaning idiot all thanks to a misunderstanding of bugs bunny. I say all this because 1. etymology is my passion and 2. it's funny that even with the older definition this word still applies. How come people will put more effort into reddit essays than academic ones? suffering.Giorno?(e)egoNow with the points you just made, write an 10 page essay about Moby Dick due today in 2 minutes that will be worth 100% of your grade.

Pretty intriguing one way or another.This is the real answer If my social arguments online would influence my popularity and life I would\u2019ve been dead or homeless by now.LOL not even that. I just don't care about the topic in class or being told I have to write about it. [deleted]People willingly go to batting cages but get mad when i throw baseball sized rocks at their face while they sleep. I wonder why.I had an English professor in my last semester of college do that with an essay plus a presentation to the class. From what I recall, nobody half-assed it and they all seemed genuinely interested in their topic.I would KILL to have that choice. I have no desire to write about if it mattered that Othello was black...this, this is itthank youDepends on the topic. If it's a forced topic 95% is probably a good number. But when you get to choose your topic, I'd be willing to bet that number drops by quite a bit. Even if you hate *having* to write the essay, writing the essay can be enjoyable. I had to write a 10 page research essay for a class last semester, but we got to choose the topic. I did mine about marijuana, enjoyed nearly every second of it to some extent.There is more than one!\n\nSeriously though, essays became a lot more fun once I realized that (decent) teachers aren\u2019t looking for a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer, but a good argument.

While Wikipedia itself is not a source, it can provide links to real sources. Don't use contractions.Math teaches critical thibking and problem solving skills. But yea, I don't think I'm ever gonna use Side Angle Side in the real world.oofI would accept that! If only I wasn\u2019t under deadline to finish a rough draft for a class. (Went back to college [online] after 25 years away, and all this writing is making my brain mushy.)I wish I had a passion for something Yep. This year for school I had to write a five page research paper for my British literature class. I hate writing in complete sentences half the time, never mind a research paper. We got to pick our topic from a list, and I chose David Bowie, which I narrowed down to symbolism in his music.\n\nIt\u2019s the best goddamn thing I\u2019ve ever written, and I had a blast doing it.How does one narrow in on their passions? \nReading is one of my hobbies. And the Scarlet Letter is the most boring book I have ever read. Even just thinking about it is putting me to sleep.

I gotcha. Ahem, let me write a ten paragraph essay to prove you wrong...Ours is PEEL - Point, Evidence, Explain, Link to questionTopic Sentence, Explanation, Evidence, LinkYes, this is caused by a variety of reasons. Please allow me to explain why someone would have a more enjoyable time writing an \u201cinternet argument\u201d essay than an \u201cacademic\u201d essay.\n\n\n First, you are allowed to construct an argument and comment all on your own time. You can take as long as you want! Here I am, an hour late, and I\u2019m typing this comment anyway for some karma points.\n\n\nSecondly, the topic of your \u201cargument\u201d is usually on something you care about and not some shitty novel that you couldn\u2019t give a damn for. I will definitely explain to you how you should have 360\u00b0 no-scoped that bitch into oblivion instead of camped like a pussy and switched to your sidearm in a game of Carl of Dooty, but I will need some motivation and reason to write something about \u201cMoby Dick\u201d. I don\u2019t care about dick, Moby.\n\n\nNext, you generally don\u2019t need to worry about making mistakes. Unless you\u2019re like me, where I acknowledge potential flaws in my argument but then turn them on the poor sap I\u2019m dropping this nuclear strike on with my comment, there really is nothing to worry about when you make an \u201cinternet argument\u201d. You don\u2019t need to spellcheck, or even know the meaning of some words. Hell, use those words anyway to give your argument some more pizzazz!\n\n\n This also leads to the next reason where there\u2019s nothing going to a \u201cgrade\u201d when arguing on the internet. It\u2019s all about them scores in school, but who gives a **fook** about whether you got an A or B on an argument? All that matters is in your mind whether you won or not, and screw the other guy/girl (impossible situation cuz =/= exist)\n\n\nFinally, and probably the most important and deeply felt reason is that you don\u2019t need to follow no shitty formatting structure. MLA? Nope. Chicago? Fuck that. TEEL? HAH! Person asking for your sources? Tell them to **google it**, *loser*! \n\n\nThis has been an essay on why it it more enjoyable to engage in internet arguments than in writing an essay for school. There\u2019s a certain sense of relief in getting out that sudden surge of anger or excitement you feel after reading a comment and making your own in reply, while an essay is basically always stress.thank u ilyHappy turnip cake day! \ud83c\udf70What\u2019s this for? [deleted]That is presuming that people writing 10 paragraph arguments online are the same people who actually put effort into learning essay writing in school.Name checks out?I\u2019ve seen a guy get up mid argument to go walk to his apartment to get his programming book to make his point. The answer is tabs.I have a WhatsApp group with all my buddies from my engineering program. I get thousands of texts when they spark you an argument on the best graphics card.Wait are you saying people indent with spaces when they are programming. How do they do this and why?What sort of neanderthal uses spaces to separate their code? Whoever it is I hope they have to fix their own code.Might as well argue over Vim vs emacs. (the answer is vim)I tell you what, I'm a pretty big nerd when it comes to a lot of my hobbies, I *really* get into what I'm doing. Hardcore LotR fans are on an entirely different level though, and often I go into threads asking questions about Tolkien's work that I don't even care about just to read some of the answers. Those guys go hard in the paint, and the passion is clearly evident.Tom Bombadil added nothing to the story and was nothing more than a severe annoyance, don\u2019t @ me. So then out of curiosity, is it a good economic safeguard in your opinion? No you wouldn't![deleted]I really like this creative thought process. \nAt some point in high school we had one of our first totally open projects: break down a song and what we thought it meant. My teacher was worried when I chose Comfortably Numb, and thankfully rather than saying \u201cno,\u201d she just requested that it not be all about drugs. I kind of wish I still had a copy of that work.\n\nA while back I took written comm in college... totally open as long as you did the right format (instructional, descriptive, researched, etc.). There wasn\u2019t a single thing I wrote for that class that I wasn\u2019t proud of. Instructor even asked if she could use one of my pieces as an example for a future class.*Good, A. L., Samaritan. (2005, May 3). Fuck you. Retrieved April 7, 2019, https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fuck%20you*They're good books, but not remotely interesting enough to a teenager to write essays analyzing them.  There's no passion involved, even if the book is good.  I love Frankenstein, but I don't want to ever touch another essay about feminism in Frankenstein.  It's tired and frankly annoying.  \n\nLots of the themes pushed in books that are meant to enrich the maturity of its students just aggravate them when they're forced to write about them for a grade.  Like, I get the messages, I've already digested the book.  If you want to teach me to write, teach me to fucking write with grammar and show me good writing and make me summarize shit - don't play on the pretension of artistry and research.  These books are interesting to think about, but not nearly interesting enough to pick apart.Honestly though those books teach good lessons and Gatsby at least to me was a really fun read Different books tend to speak powerfully to different people, at different life stages.\n\nAnd a forced read+essay can taint the experience.Yeah, if you\u2019re only good at writing when you\u2019re heavily interested in the topic, I\u2019d argue you aren\u2019t a good writer.I felt similar in school, but if you can whip up a paper in 10 minutes while another kid has to take hours, you've got time to explore other things while your peers slave away to get the same degree. It's just a hurdle. If you're a strong writer already, you get to sprint while they have to pace. Not a bad spot to be in. All I\u2019m learning right now is bullshit I\u2019ll never use and stupid formulas ill never remember out of high school, Start exploring hobbies. Who knows what you\u2019ll find. Hey! One time my friends and I were having a discussion about passion. My friend said she didn\u2019t think she was passionate about anything, but I told her that that was crazy! She didn\u2019t strike me as a person with no passion, and some of the things I personally thought she was passionate about was being a good person, her family and her animals! We realized passion wasn\u2019t just about being super into a hobby and making money off of it one day, but it\u2019s the things that keep us going and wake us up every day! My cousin is obsessed with video games but recently she\u2019s been the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen her be. She collects old consoles, plays a bunch of games with her equally nerdy boyfriend, and even built a pc with her brother! Society may think she\u2019s wasting her time but i think if she works so hard at work why shouldn\u2019t she be able to enjoy the things that really make her happy? You may not know it but you could be passionate about so many things! Maybe Do some brainstorming :) - Until you find your passion, your passion is finding your passion\n\nsome Buddhist guy probably, 2019Eat passionfruit. i have a passion for eating.

If you just disconnect for a little you'd be surprised what you'll start enjoying again.One of the finals for a film class I was taking was like an 8 page paper on classic American cinema, but our thesis could be anything we wanted, so I wrote a massive paper about shitty terrible z-movies and how z-movies are today and it was my favorite paper to write of all time Take away the apples, grapes, mangoes, kiwis and you've narrowed down to passions and maybe a few others?hey that chapter about a door was so intense so much going on!> And the Scarlet Letter is the most boring book I have ever read\n \nPreach it brother!  We should get together and do something about it but it's like once we escape, we leave that crap for the next generation.\nOh you know.Pride in your passion.Passion fruit?DefinitelySorry the correct answer was \"no u\".Timeout corner for 10 minutes. Go think about what you just said. I really *really* want to slap some of my professors and say this. Like, You gave me two days and I completely analyzed the entire topic in almost as many words as the original text. Suck my fuckin dick. Then do 10 pages on the cat in the hat.

I would've never passed anything if I couldn't. But it takes longer and isn't up to the same quality I can produce from works of passion.  \nA lot of that is just a matter of inspiration and investment.

I've wanted to be a game dev since I was a little kid playing Pokemon Sapphire, but it took me until my internship last summer to realize that I desperately don't want it to be my job. I though I was super passionate about programming and I was really excited to get to work and do it for a living, and then it just drained me. I love problem solving, and I get a crazy high from figuring something out and learning something new, but the spark I had for the actual programming got snuffed out. I don't want that to happen to gaming and development.\n\nHowever, I did learn that my absolute favorite part of working was learning, so it led me to figuring out that I want to teach. As soon as I have the capital I'm gonna go back to school so I can teach college, because I want to share the high I get from learning new things with as many people as possible. \n\nSome people do great making money off their passions, but in my case making money off of it kinda ruined it. Just something to think about.Inspired, thank you I really needed to hear this. Thank you If your passion is finding your passion then you've already found your passion...No you don\u2019t\"Pride in your passion\" - title of your sex tape\n\nis deliciousLost marks for not demonstrating technical controlhttps://ibb.co/xS3g88cIt\u2019s only been an hour give the man some leeway will you In high school English classmust be feel freaking greatWhat is going Hitler?I once called a kid a douchebag in class, the teacher walked by and overheard me. She stopped, and decided an appropriate discipline would be to assign only me the homework of writing an essay about douches and how they\u2019re used as a cleansing product. \n\nI proceeded to come back the next day with a letter from my Mom telling the teacher she was being a petty jerk essentially. \n\nThe teacher dropped it and never mentioned it again after that. What a douchebag. What a wonderful time.How do you align if you don't know how many columns your indentation will consume?\n\nGenuine question, not intended as a gotcha. Commas for indentation, new line for alignment, got it. TBH I use the 'centre text' option in Word 98 for mine.I am an absolute monster, I double dog dare you make me not use tabs in python...? Isn't that more typically an argument against tabs? I don't wanna be that guy, but that just sounds objectively wrong. Can't you just adjust how much spacing the tab button does on most IDE's?I would say nearly the same, but add that learning to distill liquor is also a safe bet. So long as there are people walking the Earth, there will be people getting fucked up, so you're guaranteed a market. Plus it makes a great sanitizer/antiseptic. I wrote an entire essay, but then I realized that it doesn't prove anything because the user might be a bot.\n\nI'm telling you, since bots took over the internet, there is no way to know if someone is real or just some virtual existence tricking you into having a conversation.Probably something about the monster being given intelligence and agency but being villified when he attempts to use that agency. I guessThat\u2019s fairSure. Start animating. [deleted]You forgot your [source.](http://salmonofcapistrano.com)Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.Also, it was eye-opening for me to realize that my work doesn't need to be my passion. I like my job as a nurse, I'm good at it and most days I feel good going to work. But it's not my passion. I'm not a shining hero in scrubs sweating tears of Florence Nightingale, taking care of the weak and wounded with all my heart and living off the wellbeing of my fellow humans. I'm just a dude who works as a nurse and tries to do good job. It pays decently, employment rate is excellent, I have nice co-workers and it's a fulfilling job. But my passions lie elsewhere and that's okay. What I do 38 hours 45 minutes a week doesn't need to define who I am. Oh shit...He will fucking eat you with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. Fabulous!Can I redo the assignment?[https://i.redd.it/9wgsq6g46lyx.jpg](https://i.redd.it/9wgsq6g46lyx.jpg)[deleted][deleted]Idk, I'm kinda with the teacher on this one. Seems like a pretty clever punishment.I don't get the question. Indentation is completely determined by the structure of the program above (especially easy in C-style languages, just count opening and closing braces) and the size of your indent (usually 4).Oh god oh fuckJust use an IDE that adds 4 spaces when you hit tab. Assuming an average tab equates to 4 spaces, pressing tab 3 times vs 2 times is a lot easier to differentiate over 3 spaces vs 4 spaces.Even Vim has this feature, there's no reason not to use tabs for indentation. If you're aligning stuff that doesn't follow normal indentation, you tab to the right level and put spaces for the rest.If you are writing to fixed line lengths, you then also need to specify tab width, and the defaults (80 characters, 8-spaced tabs) can really limit your nesting capabilities. Which may actually be a feature depending on the language, I concede.\n\nAlso, there are styles that place brackets at half-indent, which would mean two tabs for each indentation level, and that is definitely too much. Although I think that people who use those bracket styles should probably not be given much consideration.[deleted][deleted]Making memes about any subject can be a passion. It's best to not have such a narrow focus, even in a single community. It's best that a larger audience can be reached. I try doing that with anime, and sometimes, even outside the anime community, it's a hit. I stand corrected No, you obviously didn't try hard enough so i am ignoring a school policy that says you get a second chance.No fuck that person, you did the right thing! Putting someone in their place (when they\u2019re wrong) is always worth it and, I\u2019d argue, necessary.God I hate it when people don't acknowledge that I'm right. It's petty, but I proved you wrong, at least give me the satisfaction of acknowledging that!I got into a full blown argument with one of my college stat teachers. He was explaining something and the example in the book had a wrong answer (I forget what the issue was but it was essentially teaching the wrong way to solve a problem, not just a calculation error). \n\nI pointed this out. He refused to believe me. He told me to stop questioning him. I absolutely refused. I said \u201cIf you\u2019re so sure you are right, then go through the problem and tell me the answer.\u201d \n\nHe did so and was proven wrong. He then said \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have questioned me anyway.\u201d Some people suck. [deleted]Same. I thought he would return with a well written essay that would surprise the teacher, but nope.why is it bad to use tabs in python?That usually don\u2019t last so long from my experience. Only once.Well, that's where you're wrong...Python can only compile one type of white space (aka either spaces or tabs). But most IDEs just make 2 or 3 (edit: usually 4 actually) spaces when you press the tab button so that python doesn\u2019t break.r/suicidebywordsPractice makes perfect, or just go slowerWho said your not the one making itUnderrated. Why is it that way? Hahaha. How long are your orgasms. If mine were any longer I might die. I\u2019m talking about the actual orgasm haha. It's been 10 minutes[deleted]Well it\u2019s to stop you from using tabs at all because tabs can be different sizes depending on what text editor you\u2019re using so it can fuck with alignment, whereas spaces are always 1 character wide. But there\u2019s a lot of argument for both sides and I\u2019m not going to take a stance on if it\u2019s better in principle, just that using spaces is the agreed upon style and how python works so you should do it too.Spacing matters in python since it doesn\u2019t have brackets, the \u201cbrackets\u201d are interpreted by the white space. I imagine this is why it can only accept one of tabs or spaces.I think maybe for projects where multiple people work on it. I use tabs, but the guy who adds more could use spaces, which would mess up the code. Mailing it all jus one thing makes that easier.",

    "Comments": "I worked in child development. Lots of people who take parenting classes were definitely the ones who needed to take parenting classes. Some of them had no idea of really simple things like, don't give your newborn soda, don't cover your baby in blankets, don't prop a bottle up so it just drips into their mouth.\n\nEdit: went to see Hobbes and shaw. Was wondering why my phone was vibrating nonstop. Turns out it was all you people lol.\nI'm going to sleep now. Tried to answer as many replies as I could. Y'all made my night.The fire stations by me used to provide free car seat checks for new parents, to make sure it was installed properly. They stopped doing it for exactly this reason. Everyone who was worried enough to get it checked was worried enough to have done it right in the first placeNew parents need to find out about  burping and swaddling etcSad but true, too bad the people that should be taking them usually don\u2019t want toIn all fairness, the people who voluntarily take parenting classes may be well-intentioned, smart, and cautious - but there is still valid information and tips they can get from parenting classes.  \n\n\nIt's basically a matter of taking 85%-good people and bumping that up to a 90% or 100%, while anyone below that is just sort've a lost cause that won't cooperate anyway.I took a parenting class before my daughter was born.... I now feel like it should have been much longer. Like 4 year course, with yearly therapy sessions afterword.OR... some of the people in the parenting classes signed up for them fully after they'd abused and neglected their child for 14 years and think that the token effort of them going to the class exonerates them from being shitty human beings.  They will go on to proudly display their \"Parenting Class Certificate of Completion\" as proof of their parental supremacy.\n\nIf you guessed \"that sounds like someone's actual personal experience!\" it's probably because it is.I mean in spirit you're not wrong, but if you feel the need to take a parenting class there's probably good reason for it.A bit of a catch 22? Take a class and you wont need it, dont take a class and you will need it.I had a friend once tell me something similar: The fact that you\u2019re willing to buy and read books about how to be a better parent means you\u2019re probably doing great as it is!Its like seeing the \"be a good dad commercials\". Dudes who are good dads don't need them. Dudes who arent good dads dont give a fuck and will just ignore them like they ignore their kids.I was required to as part of my divorce. It was the biggest pile of condescending bullshit I\u2019ve ever experienced.\n\nYou should feed your children EVERY DAY and don\u2019t assault each other in front of them? Who knew?As someone who has voluntarily taken a parenting class......thanks?Me and my wife took a prenatal class. Went twice. The level of ignorance in that room was painful.All parents need to take parenting classesThere was an unpopular opinion thread that mentioned the idea of needing to be licensed to be a parent and I agree.Imagine how mad I got when they sentenced me to mandatory anger management classes. I don't fucking need that, you stupid judgemental motherfuckers, I'll fucking kill all of you!Probably too late to get any eyes on this, but this post reminded me of my wife and me attending an early morning prenatal class. I had been up for probably 22-ish hours the day before working and had gotten just a few hours of sleep before going. There were about 10-12 couples there. \n\nWe watched a film that followed two couples as they progressed through each couples\u2019 pregnancy. One planned to use anesthesia while the other opted for natural birth. Of course, most people there were first time parents. \n\nThe film ended with a real-life birth, culminating in the delivery of the afterbirth - the bloody amniotic sac that held the fetus. The film abruptly ended and the lights came on. Most people were stunned, sitting slack-jawed. After what felt like an eternity, I clapped my hands loudly and said, \u201cTime to take a break for lunch?\u201d Half the room laughed while the others retched. My wife did not approve, but it was one of my prouder moments.One morning listening to the radio and they were discussing a case where a woman fell asleep at the hospital with her newborn baby in her arms.  She rolled over or dropped it or something, I forget exactly what happened, but anyway the baby died. \n\n  \n Callers were putting their two cents in arguing whether it was the mother's fault and she should have known to never sleep with a baby like that, or it's the doctors and nurse's fault for not telling her and letting it happen under their supervision.  People arguing whether that it's common sense and that the mother was a stupid bitch, or whether it's something you are expected to learn from watching your family handle babies.  \n\n  \nI'm horrified and this added to the pile of reasons why I'm never having children.  I wouldn't have known not to sleep with the baby like that and killed it.  I also grew up with no extended family around so I have no examples to follow for this or anything else.  I wouldn't know this kind of thing is learned at a parenting class either, reckoning common sense or instinct or something takes over when you become a mom.Parents who worry about their kids\u2019 screen time are also usually not the parents who need to worry.I'd disagree. I'm sure there's people that are aware they need help and go looking for it.\n\nThe people that need them the most are also probably some of the least likely to go though, I will agree with that.[deleted]Idk I\u2019ve already taken three and still feel like a fuck up.\n\nI have ADD. Consistency is so hard for me.\"Studies show kids who drink more sugary drink, get lower grades in school\" or maybe, just maybe they have shittier parents?Yes I am, all parents should seek out extra support be it classes, family, doctors, friends or more structured support including education.\n This showerthought perpetuates to stigma of getting help like parenting classes. \nPlease, if you are a parent and you feel like extra help or guidance would be useful please seek it out.I went to daddy boot camp. It was like 2 hours. My daughters are 8 and 6 now. I def didn't need the \"training\", but I got a certificate \ud83d\ude01 I shoulda took a class on staying married   lolI teach at a preschool. This is 100% truth.Every parent can benefit from parenting classes. First time parents benefit from them simply because they may know what to do.I'm not entirely certain about that. Today we just found out our baby is likely to be born with either a genetic disorder or a mental disorder, or both (he has mild ventriculomegaly and we don't know the cause, yet). We are planning on going to parenting classes to learn how to best care for him since we have no fucking clue how to parent a kid who potentially has schizophrenia to be a happy and healthy adult. All we hope for is supporting his wellbeing and happiness, but I really don't think we will have that ability unless someone teaches us how to do that.Yup, I was so worried about becoming a dad and being a good dad. A lady I worked with said I had nothing to worry about, because the fact that I was worried meant I was already a good dad.My wife and I saw a parenting class being offered in our city, and having just had a baby, we decided to sign up for fun. The teacher had us all introduce ourselves and say what we hoped to get out of the class. We were the only ones there who didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m here by court order\u201d.Along a similar vein. When anything is being discussed at a work meeting/training. All the wrong people go \"oh shit, am I doing that wrong?\". And the other half go \"nah...he isn't talking about what I do.Yep. It's a corollary of if you're worried about being a shitty parent, you're probably not.Everyone *should* take parenting classes but those would be the people who are responsible enough to get buy without it fineSimilarly, the people who want kids early and often are the ones who shouldnt have any. The ones who wait til they are financially and emotionally stable with a partner before having kids, are the ones who should have all the kids.\n\n\nThis predicament is the reason our society is coming apart at the seems.And those who seek power are the last people who should get it (see: politicians, middle management)I just signed my husband and I up for 6 parenting classes today.... should I cancel? Jksimilarly, people who question if they\u2019re crazy are less concerning to me than people who are confident that they\u2019re notShould have to get a license to parent. Pass a course or whatever child you get will be taken away until you passKinda like students who attempt extra credit don\u2019t need it\n Those that need it don\u2019t bother attempting.This is a funny, real-world \"proof\" of the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). Well done!This isn\u2019t necessarily true. The nurses told us pretty much everything we needed to know after the delivery and gave us tons of information up until the time we left the hospital. Plus, the amount of prep before the baby is born, advice from friends/family, the internet, there\u2019s a ton of help out there other than parenting classes.I would say the same thing about parenting books too.Similarily: most of the people that are worried about the world being overpopulated and choose not to have children weren't the problem in the first place because they are generally people in countries where the norm is 1-2 children anyway, and have shrinking populations.This is true for almost anything: managers who (voluntarily and on their own volition) take HR courses on how to be a better manager are NOT the ones who really need the courses; students who opt for extra credit work to help them practice skills are often not the ones who desperately need the additional help.Random but true story: my gf at the time (wife) had her water break about 15 minutes before we were leaving to a class hahah. She \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop peeing\u201d, as she put it. Next morning I had my first born son!All parents should take parenting classes.Yes we do, and we know it! That\u2019s why we take the classes!Wife made me take a class because she says I'm not doing rightly fatherly things with my kids.   First class, realize I'm the only one in class not there by judges order...I don\u2019t think this applies to all people, my dad raised me the hardcore Japanese way and decided it was enough, he needed to take classes, it\u2019s a lot better now but I think this statement is wrongGood parentals want to be just that.What about court ordered?There is a quote I heard from an expert about this subject that stuck with me..  I can\u2019t remember the quote or who said it and I\u2019m not a parent but the sentiment was the same and can be applied to lots of things..Kinda like parent conference night... most of the parents I need there, don't show up.If they think they need them then they likely know themselves and know they lack some knowledge.Fuck I love this subVery true. My Dad(#1 dad on the planet ) took extra classes in college that did not even apply to his major to better prepare for those sort of things like finance and child psychology. Blows me away. At that age most people's main concern is just on their own career path and getting a degree.Parents that show up to parent-teacher conferences are seldom the ones that need to show up.I took parenting classes before my daughter was born at my local planned parenthood. I learned so much about childcare and how to take care of a newborn. In the process I also earned a crib, bassinet, and a ton of diapers. I highly recommend parenting classes to everyone.\"If you worry about being a good parent, you're already doing better than a lot of parents\" -My fathers advice to my brotherI took parenting class in my school because I\u2019m gonna need the experience when I have kids and it sure helps I recommend it for everyoneJust like the men who ask for the father's blessing for marriage don't need it.Just like parent/teacher conferences. My dad was a teacher for over 30 years. He said the only parents who came to parent/teacher conferences were those he didn\u2019t need to meet with because their kids were doing well in class.There was a lot of stuff I didn\u2019t know about babies before I had one. \n\nYou can\u2019t feed them honey until they\u2019re 1. Honey is the only food that never expires but it contains bacteria that can cause botulism. \n\nYou start doing tummy time at 1 day old so they don\u2019t get a lopsided head. \n\nEverything is a suffocation waiting to happen. Newborns don\u2019t know to move their head so if anything is close to their face, they can suffocate on it. They only need a tight fitted sheet in their crib and just swaddle them. The crib looks huge and oddly empty with just a tiny swaddled baby in it. \n\nBreastfed babies need to take a vitamin D supplement but formula babies don\u2019t. \n\nBreastfed babies drink the same amount of milk until they wean off but formula fed babies will need more in their bottles as they get bigger. \n\nEtc. there\u2019s more I just can\u2019t think of right now. But those are the main things I learned from having a baby.Call me holistic but anyone that takes a parenting class is helping the world.I get what you're saying, but the people who take those classes are essentially admitting that they want to be good parents but don't know how.Aww thank youWrong. Accepting you've got a problem with your parenting and seeking help is the first step, but is not the only step.This reminds me of that part in Freakonomics where they ask \u201cDoes reading parenting books make you a better parent?\u201d\n\nThe conclusion was that parents who voluntarily read parenting books were better parents, not because they read something profound in the book but because they were the type of parent who would buy parenting book.Took parenting classes because the first newborn I ever held was my own. Didn't know anything about a newborn but learned enough for it to survive long enough to google everything elseTotally disagree.\n\nI took voluntary parenting classes...and I needed them.\n\nAlmost no one \u201cjust knows\u201d how to care for a newborn baby - I sure the hell didn't. And I learned a lot in the classes.I think they should be mandatory and if you fail you lose you're right to have a kidShort story: everyone needs parenting classesAnyone having a baby would be stupid AF not to. You're making a human. They don't come with instructions and your instincts suck. Trust me. \n\nIt's the hardest job you will ever do, short of maybe fighting forest fires or something like that. \n\nTrain for it, dummies.Your logic is bunk. Counterpoint:\n\nAnyone who volunteers their time to learning parenting skills become more suitable for Parenthood. Try not to overcomplicate a simple idea.Not truethey may not need them the most, but they still need them.Other than the ones in court ordered parenting classes.What? Being self aware that you're not ready to be a parent means you don't need to take a parenting class?\n\nWhat kind of logic is this post lolOh... so true... for a long time I have been saying that we should cut out Shakespeare and trigonometry from high school and replace it with parenting classes...Children\u2019s case manager/social worker here. Can confirm.The people who voluntairly take parenting classes do need parenting classes. As well as a substantial amount of the population. It should be a mandatory class IMO.Our hamster raised 5 kids to adulthood. Parenting \u2018skills\u2019 are over rated.But parenting classes are fun and interesting!I even paid money!Kind of wish we did, but I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.Nah man, I definitely needed that classThere\u2019s a weird paradox going on in that thoughtJust say no\nThey\u2019re not...socketing.Parenting classes should be mandatory[deleted]... or... you know... they have enough free time and money to be able to do such things.And people who absolutely should not have children breed like crazyYes well this goes for most things. \nLike people having kids for example... most shouldn\u2019t be... and the ones who should have kids  just don\u2019t.Same with a psychologist...?People having kids are usually not the ones that should be having kidsMy mom took them twice before adopting me. Once because she had too and a second time because she met my dad and he had too so she did them again :)I saw a statistic that showed if you purchased a parenting self-help book you had a 90% chance of being a better parent by some metric than someone who didn't. However actually reading the book had little to no effect. Just caring enough to purchase it, or in your case attend a class means you'll be a good parent.Everyone bemoans neglectful parents, but no one wants procreation to be regulated. We regulate everything in our lives except how many new people you can make. In fact, the government encourages you to make as many babies as possible!I don\u2019t think that\u2019s mathswife and I took a parenting class. I didn't learn a whole lot of new information, but we gained 2 things from it:\n\n1) It normalized the process.  It really helped us get into the right frame of mind that the baby was coming imminently.  The sooner you start accepting that reality the less of a shock it is when you're standing in the hospital holding a brand new human and realizing that its well-being is completely up to you.\n\n2) We met some great people.  We regularly have meet-ups with the other families that were in that class, and can trade-off baby sitting for an afternoon.  It's been especially great for my wife to be able to meet up with some other moms and their kids to go for a mid-week walk or hang out at the playground.Yeah it's just an ego problem. the bigger the ego, the harder it is for you to admit you don't know how to do something or can't figure it out on your own. The truth is, we all kindof know how to be parents instinctually, but we dont know the psychological differences between our brains and a kids brain. And people think that parenting class is all about raising a better child, when in reality its about having an easier and more enjoyable parenting experience. Because most of what that kid will become is out of your control.Completely disagree. I like to think I'm a good responsible parent and I took classes which were hugely eye opening.\n\nReading and taking lessons on a subject are the best way to learn. You think you know everything about caring for tiny humans because you *were* one once or maybe saw your parents do it.\n\nYou don't. I would no sooner try to parent without reading/taking classes than I would attempt to fix a major part of my motor vehicle without getting some help first.\n\nDo not listen to this shower thought. If you're considering taking classes, go fucking take them so your kid has the best fucking shot they have at a good life.Are there parenting classes specific to goddamn two-year-olds?  Because I need one!not necessarily true but it certainly shows a good attitude toward itSome parenting  classes are court orderedI mean someone has to take care of these kids that have absent/shitty/careless parents who refuse to properly educate/vaccinate/care for their children. \nThese classes have real-life application too. \nTeaching and daycare, pediatrics and some social service workers all benefit from the class's teachings. \n\nI've always been fond of \"It's better to learn a skill and never have to use it than it is to need a skill and not have any of the knowledge to use it\".Have you taken one? Some of those people *definitely* need to be there.I\u2019d have been utterly lost without them. I had no newborn experience whatsoever.Actually, everyone needs it. My degree is largely based on childhood development and I learned a lot. It's different as a parent vs a clinician.Couples who say, \"we plan to have kids eventually but aren't quite ready yet,\" are way more ready than most people having kids.Catch-22Lol no in many cases they are. I see what you mean, I just don't believe itnot always true, i chose to go to a parenting class with my girlfriend and im a shit one :(Well maybe not the ones that need it most but most every parent could get betterI remember hearing about one study where people who bought parenting books had kids with better outcomes, but there was absolutely no difference between those who actually read the books and those who didn\u2019t bother.The parents who attend parent teacher conferences are not the parents who need to attend the conferences.This happens with students in college too. As a person in student affairs, I do various workshops for students (study skills, consent/title IX, etc.). The students who come are doing pretty well anyway, but the students who should be there are not. So we have to find other ways to inform them.....but they won\u2019t even watch videos wahhhThis is why we need to teach child development as a required course in High School.  This is our best bet to reach potential teen moms and dads and to stop abuse and neglect.\n\nThere are huge societal costs for wasted human potential.  Costs in education, welfare, foster care, drug rehab, crime, law enforcement, health insurance, law enforcement, prisons, to say nothing of the cost of human misery.  Better pay for teaching than prisons.A bunch of you are taking this literally to mean there's nothing you could learn from taking the class. Obviously everybody could learn something from a parenting class. This is basically saying that: \"those would benefit from the most from parenting classes are least likely to take it voluntarily\".\n\nThis is true of most things in life to be fair. If you care enough to better yourself at anything you're usually in the top percentile.\n\nThe guys who are paying attention to the Me Too movement aren't the ones who need to be told don't rape. The people who spend their free time reading programming books are usually not the ones who need the information.Ironically enough, we're expecting our 4th baby and the hospital that we're delivering at is making my wife watch all of these parenting videos online before we go in for the delivery, and the hospital will not discharge us until she does. She's annoyed because she literally knows all of this stuff already.Put the milk in the refrigerator...or lacking that, a cool wet sack.\n\nAnd put your garbage in a garbage bag, people. I can't stress that enoughAnd for gods sake people, when the milk goes bad throw it out.This works beyond parenting. For the most part, the people that seek out classes in order to better themselves are the type of people who could probably manage on the own.My father wanted custody of me and was ordered by the court to take parenting classes, he didn't. I was ordered to go with my father every other weekend, I didn't.\n\nHe really did need to take parenting classes.Willingness to take a class to learn how to do something properly does not mean you already know how to do that thing properly.  Nor does it mean you will be successful even if you do take the class.I am gonna take it to learn  how to deal with kids when I'm older\n\n(In in highschool)Most people having kids shouldn\u2019t be having kids. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02There was an infant CPR class offered at the hospital my son was born.  Totally free.  Two nurses volunteeted to teach the class at the end if their shift.  \n\nI was the only one that showed up.  \n\nI learned the shit outta infant CPR that evening.   Gave them both a hearty thank you and a firm handshake for being such great teachers.I often feel this way about people who want to be managers.Hahaha! So, so very true!Realizing you are unqualified does not make you more qualified. No.give this redditer gold!More accurately, parents who are engaged during parent-teacher conferences aren't the parents that need to be there.Having been to several, this is not true at all.Can confirm. Taught parenting classes. To their credit though the parents wanted to be better.There are likely a few have the self awareness enough to say to themselves \"I am really screwing this/these kid(s) up. I need help.\" and even fewer who have the resolve to follow through with it. I would say the majority of people taking parenting courses it has been ordered or at the very least recommended by a professional.Actually, everyone should take parenting classes.Everybody needs parenting class. This sht is hard.It\u2019s like the students who come to me because they wanted their A to be an A+. I just want a couple of C students to drop by.Parenting classes should be mandatoryIf I could give one piece of advice about parenting classes it's that if your wife asks you to go to them, go. \n\nThey're not necessarily going to teach you anything, as most of the information is basic as shit but chances are your wife is crazy excited about having a baby and is likely looking forward to the classes herself. \n\nMy wife knew that I was hating life going to the classes but still appreciated the fact that I went there with her and she really enjoyed them. \n\nJust don't be the dude sitting there raising your hand every time the nurse asks \"any questions?\". Everyone hates that guyJust like people who read books about organizing your stuff are already well-organized.when i read this i actually thought about therapy... people who voluntarily go to therapy don\u2019t need to NOT go to therapy. they realize they could benefit from therapy, which is why they go. they may not have all the tools they need to manage whatever they\u2019re dealing with.Parents who show up to conferences are not the parents who need to be there. \n\nParents who help their kids with their homework are not the parents whose kids need help. \n\nUs teachers have many. More like the thoughts that keep us up at night, rather than shower thoughts for us, unfortunately. \n\nSorry to be such a bummer, guys! It\u2019s day 5 and I\u2019m already stressing about my batch this year! Shoutout to all the teachers out there for surviving the first few days/weeks! \ud83d\ude05What if one day we need to attend parenting classes to get the approval to have children?Never overestimate the logical reasonability of an emotionally compromised human whos never felt a soft human head before.I took some relationship course thing in high school. we talked about good vs bad relationships, what's healthy ect... purely optional, these boys were excellent men who just wanted to be even better. The papers that were talked about, given scenarios always assumed that boys were the violent ones and only wanted sex. Every day the leader of the group was always low key ashamed that this is what the paper contained. She knew damn well that we were well meaning boys. Before every reading paper she apologized in advance.My husband is going to have to take a parenting class as he's an only child and never even baby sat a family member's baby before. He can't hold, feed, swaddle or change a baby at all; and he's terrified of how fragile babies are.\n\nEven though I know all these things, and have nannyed through high school and college, I'll be taking the class with him. I may not think I need it, but there might be something new that I don't know about that could benefit me.My wife is a teacher and every year during parent teacher conferences she tells me similarly that the parents who show up are never the ones who need to come. Parenting isn't easy anyways but parents who care should never be told they're wasting their time by being there for their child, be it parenting classes or parent teacher conferences.I probably could have skated by without parenting classes. My husband on the other hand had hardly even looked at a baby much less cared for one. So we went for him and I learned so much I never thought I didn't know. I highly recommend it to any first time parents.Before I had a kid, I was so scared of screwing up my future kiddo with my own craziness. When I would talk to my best friend about my fears she would stop me and say \u201cyou know why you\u2019re not going to be a shitty parent? Because you are actually worrying about screwing up your kid! Calm down!\u201dThis reminds me of when I got divorced and threw myself into counseling because how could I possibly raise a child in a one parent home when my (now) ex was away 6 weeks at a time for work /s. I learned some kick ass skills, became a better mother and didn\u2019t freak out (like I was previously doing) counseling is such a good thing.No. Everyone does.I voluntarily took a parenting class with my wife and I definitely needed it.Coincidentally, I went to my first parenting/prenatal class this evening. Mostly for the social aspect because I have no friends and I feel like I should have \"mom friends\".Especially when theyre banned from schoolsProtip: If you just don't have kids, then you won't have to worry about any of it.Not entirely true. I need to improve on my parenting. I also need help to do so.no one is ever ready for parenting. everyone needed parenting classes.It's people that don't have kids and want kids, but if you've already got kids then your fucked.It's not an ethics classlikewise the parents who show up to parent teacher conferences are not the parents who need to.That's what I tell my wife when she wants to buy books or go to classes. I'm like, \"you didn't do crack today, we'll be fine. We're ahead of at least 50% of the population\"Uh, what? Willingness to learn more is completely unrelated to your actual knowledge. \n\nI know literally nothing about kids. If I all of a sudden was given guardianship over one (not sure how that\u2019d happen, but whatever) is definitely need a class.Look at any inner city in the US or Europe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion answered.Guilty.I always think something similar to this when I take my dog to the vet. I\u2019m always worried that the vet will think I\u2019m a bad dog dad because he cracked a toe nail or has a skin infection. Last time I was there I vocalized this concern to the vet and they assured me that the fact that I take my dog to the vet proves I\u2019m a great dog parent.Said a parent who took the classes who now thinks they didn\u2019t need them but likes to shame others.This is dumbI took a prenatal class, bought the books and still felt unprepared when the baby got here. But he\u2019s six weeks now so I\u2019ve gotten the hang of itIt's the same as the parents who need to come to parent teacher conferences don't.As a foster parent that is unable to have kids of my own, I can say my husband and I have had a similar conversation many times addressing this. We did everything right, graduated high school, got married, joined the military... everything except have kids. My totally irresponsible friends and family went about getting pregnant in high school, using abortion as a form of bc, losing kids to the system because they didnt understand what not to do as a parent. Meanwhile my husband and I jumped over so many hoops, tried all the things to get pregnant, became foster parents, and are now waiting to adopt. It makes me so mad that we have gone through all the training we have, but kids are barely being taught about reproduction, not even a second is spared for how to parent a child. We are constantly told we dont know what we are talking about because we dont have kids of our own. The reason we have all the good, well behaved kids is because we got lucky. It had nothing to do with structure and boundaries and routine. It had nothing to do with knowing how to effectively communicate with children. Nope, it was clearly because we were lucky.yup, My best friends brother doesnt even have his own life together, and thinks he can take care of  a child at the age of 20..\nwhilst he has a huge drinking and drug problem. I told him don't be shy to ask for as much help as he can... and he has all but looked for help assuming everything will work out perfectly because now that he has a child, he is \"Automatically\" a man.\nI don't doubt his capability, he is a good person. But he knows nothing when it comes to raising a child, and unfortunately, I fear that he doesn't realize how easy it is to make a mistake when it comes to it. I truly hope he proves me wrong, but if hes not willing to learn ,and continues with his drug/alcohol problem. I only hope the mother will be brave enough to seek help.I assure you, I will voluntary take those classes and I currently have no idea to care for a baby.\n\nJust because you're aware that you're ignorant doesn't mean that you know enough to do well without help.Same as the parents who ALWAYS showed up to Parent-Teacher conferences. \n\nLike...I don't need to see y'all, your kids are perfect. Save me some time.In the same way Elmer David Davies has stained all Democrats. People remember what they want and forget even more.Every person needs to take parenting classes if they'll have a child.And then there\u2019s those other people doing life hacks to trick the doll, like if you had a real child would you tape a paintbrush to the back of its head?Not your thought.My daughter once asked me why you say yes to whatever I asked and I said because you are my daughter. My friend once said let know she can\u2019t get everything she wants so I told him she has her whole life to learn the bitter lesson no need to start this young.\nWhat I mean is, sometimes people make me feel as if I\u2019m being too protective and after consideration I conclude I\u2019m right amount of protective. She is sweet not spoiled , listens , follows and knows exactly how naughty she can be.\nAnd I took many classes like how to give bath. How to cook baby food. How to teach her stuff. What games to play with her. I started taking classes before she was born and I didn\u2019t even know need to make children burp and I\u2019m surprised how many people don\u2019t know this thing that I now feel is a basic knowledge. \nI\u2019m for classes through and throughThat is true of most things in life around personal development eg financial management, cookingI thought the same shit in the \"coping with anger\" class in which I was one of two voluntary participants (in a group of 10). Let's just say you could tell within a few minutes who was there because the judge insisted.2 girls in mine were pregnantThe people who voluntarily become President are not the people who should be PresidentIt's nice to meet people who are in the same boat as you though.[removed]A teenage family of mine and their partner have a baby on the way. Money, planning, and human care, are not things they're good at. My wife found parenting classes they will be able to attend and offered to pay for it in full, all courses, start to finish.\n\nThey said \"thank you for the offer\". And haven't done anything to follow up.\n\nI have *concerns*.I failed my class because my mom tried to pick up the \"baby\" I had to take home for the night and broke its neck.  \nShe wasn't expecting it to do that.After 14 years I still don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing as a parent. Thank God for my wife. She\u2019s the half that does. :)I would rephrase this. Parenting classes make bad parents better, but make good parents worse.People who work with children, have children, should all take it regardless. No gate keepingWell they are, but so is everyone else. Having a will to learn is step one, but until you take step two, you aren't done.The same reason motivational classes work. If you're motivated enough to get up and go to a motivational class, you will probably do great.Parenting is hard.One of the things which saddens me the most is how many irresponsible people have babies (who will doubtlessly grow up in a bad environment) at the same time so many very good couples have fertility problems and need to shell out an extra $20k to $50k in legal and/or fertility treatments. It\u2019s such a sad equation.Chyea right I have NO *FUCKING* IDEA what I'm about to be doing. Like none. I need ALL the classes.Eh. Just cause someone is responsible doesn't mean they know the nuances of parenting. Have a kid then try to post this again.Um, yeah that's not true.  My wife is currently 20 weeks pregnant and I've begin taking the classes.  While I wouldn't have been an awful parent, I'll definitely be a better one with my new knowledge. if youre a great parent, been a parent already, or even grandparents.  There are proper techniques that to learn or relearn.  There is literally so much to learn that everyone will benefit.Thousandth commentI think this needs to be said to more parents: You are not that great, the world does not need more copies of you, stop having kids. It's so narcissistic.itt: Maaaaaybe none of us should have kidsAt the same time, people who pay attention in school are not the people who *need* to pay attention :DI'm getting a divorce.  Where I live, if you are getting a divorce with minor children, you are required to take a coparenting course.  I can confirm that the people who showed up were the people who probably didn't need to take it.I\u2019m guessing OP has never been to one of these classes.I feel like there should be a name for this type of issue.\n\nSimilar example: birth control pill work most effectively if you're responsible and can take it at a dedicated schedule. So, the responsible people who can manage a pill regimen don't have kids, where those who are more irresponsible and take their pills erratically have a higher chance of having kids.\n\nIt's like the solutions to some problems don't provide much benefit to those who probably need it the most. There has to be some term for this.I\u2019m a responsible person who decided to take drivers ed because I wanted to be safe. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a perfectly fine driver without taking the class.Applies to everything really: \n\nIf you say you are an idiot - you're not. \nIf you think you're a bad person - you're probably not. \n\nEtc. As it is said in Buddhism: evil is simply ignorance. With awareness, comes the possibility of change.*most, some people are mest up but know to look for a change. I think this should become a ask RedditSome people who them are unaware others are intentionally ignorant.Most of them probably do. Basically everyone should, at least with your first.That's the biggest problem with the stupid people. They don't even know they're stupid, but if you tell them they going full mad.I took a class voluntarily when I was going through some custody problems. My lawyer felt I should 'tick some boxes' and get on the good side of the judge, if it came to that. Up until that point, I felt I had a good handle on things; the kids were well fed, we had routines, there were no real problems socially, medically, educationally etc.\n\nThe class was weird experience for me, maybe that is how it is laid out, I learnt a lot. A lot of what I learnt was from the other parents talking about what worked and what did not and their struggles. I learnt a lot from the course leader, too: I can now get my kids to agree to anything (without tricks or bribes), the kids negotiate their own issues (even though they are only 9 ears old), they share all their shit without jealousy or tantrums, they are respectful and honest and polite even to strangers. I'm not saying they wouldn't be all these things without the class, however the class definitely helped and made it real easy to implement the new changes and routines.\n\n10/10 go to a parenting class even if you think you don't need it, even if you think you have a handle on things. A few tips from other parents that have different life experiences or challenges is what you need to hear.Yeah make sense. People who voluntarily take classes to better themselves already at the point where they know a lot by the time they are parenting.Good intentions don't automatically translate to being a good parent.\n\nI've known a lot of well meaning parents who put their child at extra unecessary risk.  Luckily no harm came to their kids, but small percentages of chance that your newborn will die aren't something to be lax about.A lot of those parenting classes, triple p for example are well researched and developed by experts in the field. Every parent could benefit from them. \nIf I had kids I\u2019d do one.They should force people to do a short course on the basics and be marked as competent. The same for people purchasing animals as pets.\n\nExample:  \nScores under 50% would receive monthly checks and support.\n\nScores under 5% would have children taken into foster care?Especially court ordered parenting class.Bad parents should be euthanised like dangerous dogs are.I did, and I did.Some people are just idiots. You will understand one day. (Sucessfull father to 2 healthy children with little teeth problems compared to the rest of their age groups at school.)My husband and I split a year after our daughter was born, and went to a bunch of parenting classes to \"look good in court\". Yet , while pregnant and after, he refused to go to any with me, like the CPR for babies and toddlers class, things I thought would be beneficial for first time parents. Like . Okay.Husband and I got removed from one of our parenting classes because the instructor was blowing up the dummy baby doll... the piece you blew into was right on the baby\u2019s groin... we couldn\u2019t hold back the laughter.Unless they voluntarily take parenting classes as soon as they realise they need help.\n\nI\u2019ve made a lot of big mistakes in life - but I\u2019ve also done what people told me to do when it was clear I had screwed up.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s why my kids haven\u2019t had a smooth ride but it\u2019s been good enough that they could be reasonably whole, healthy and happy.\n\nDon\u2019t give up when you are responsible for a disaster. But do be teachable.\n\nWe are really fortunate that there are so many people willing to help - even when we are addicted bankrupt mentally ill with personality disorders - especially if you are a parent trying to do right by your kid.\n\nBut they can\u2019t help you if you can\u2019t be a little humble.Very true. I feel like  some people and its usually in my experience young single moms or poverty parents get very adamant that their parenting is perfect and they scoff at any courses or instruction. I had a  young single mom friend who got really mad when after a near choking incident in her child I suggested she take a child/infant CPR class. She took it like I was insulting her parenting because her powers of momdom would prevent her child from ever dying. \n\nShe was also the same mom that made fun of me for childproofing but then  her son almost died when he fucked with a high voltage outlet (like the kind you plug a dryer into) and almost got electrocuted to death. \n\nLike the very idea that maybe she was not 100% perfect and could use some advice or classes or ideas was insulting to herIf they didn't take the classes, they would be.Yes they are, but they are the people who should be having kidsIt's common for professionals to suggest parental counseling.  Lots of people are far from forced to take parenting classes but they need they badly.Confirmed. We voluntarily took newborn classes during her pregnancy and we're both healthcare workers. Baby's are fucking scary. The kids attending only to fulfill aid requirements and watch YouTube videos at the back of the room scared me worse. Still do.think you should have added \"the most* at the endHold up... There's TRAINING for this shit?!?Garbage in garbage can......makes sense.People who voluntarily take parenting classes are usually Dads that get forced at gunpoint to go there by their wivesThis is very untrue. Not everyone is a shitty person. Some people don't have family around. Some people like me who have decent common sense and a college degree will still take a class, I'll do it if and when I decide I want to start being a father. Not everything is inherent and some people learn better by example and in person.I saw this man backhand is five year old and then tell his wife he didn't want the boy being \"a pussy\". He knew EVERYTHING about parenting.People who voluntarily take parenting classes recognize that they have flaws and take such classes to improve their parenting skills. It's like saying people who take any classes voluntarily are not the people who need to take those classes, which makes no sense.\n\nNext time, think about what you're going to post before actually posting it.I guess people who take Parenting Classes feel like thier own parents fucked them up so instead go to them for help take these classes.Clearly you\u2019re missing the point and importance of parenting classes.\n\nParenting isn\u2019t just something you figure out or are just inherently good at.  Even good parents need guidance.I mean at least they realize they need the classes in order to take care of a child properly. There're people out there doing these exact mistakes but are too ignorant to even consider the possibility of a parenting class.I shudder at pictures of kids with soft drinks in bottles, I don't know how I would react if I saw it in the wild.Here in Poland the classes are provided by the government and go over the basics like birth, diapers etcI don\u2019t have any kids and don\u2019t plan on any for 5-10 years but I plan on taking classes.\n\nWhat do you mean by don\u2019t cover baby in blankets? Like don\u2019t bury them or something or should they have no blankets at all?There are people who think it's ok to give soda to a *newborn*?! \n\nI'd question their ability to take care of themselves as well as a baby![deleted]how dare you suggest i can't feed my puppy human donut holes & sprite, you know sprite is made with lemons & limes, right? donut holes contain nuts.. your rationale has been squashed, thank you food pyramid!I think a better way of phrasing OP\u2019s shower thought is \u201cParents who buy and read parenting books are the ones who don\u2019t need it\u201d. Though the information they read may help them, they are prepared parents who just want to get down the minute details. Most of the time people who put effort into raising their children in a formative and loving way produce quality kids who don\u2019t have long term issues.Why can\u2019t you put blankets on your baby?Teen here. Why is a bottle dripping into a baby's mouth bad? I would be scared that it would fall, but is there any other reason?I think my point is that the types of people who are that oblivious arent the ones concerned with learning how to be a parent in the first place.  That's why I said voluntary.  Pretty much ALL the people forced to be there need to be there.When I had my daughter I was worried I wouldn't be a good parent because I wasn't prepared. My mom told me if that's what I'm worried about I'm already on the right track.How was the movie?> don't prop a bottle up so it just drips into their mouth.\n\nIf you want to do this properly, make sure you cover their face with a wet cloth. It prevents the milk from splashing on impact.I'm piggybacking because I had already raised two infants when I heard about this one and I was mad as hell no one had told me, even though it's in small print on the container.\n\nNever give a child under one honey, one in 100,000 will die from it, and there is absolutely nothing the doctor can do to save them.So what you're saying is \"Everyone, please take classes.\"?The fire station near us will straight up install the car seat(s) for you. They are a pretty good group of guys/gals.That was a life saver. My baby was a month early so we didn't have time to install and inspect the car seat before she was born. These two young firefighters were fawning over my week old baby and we finally got the car seat installed correctly. Which was great because it wasn't installed correctly when we left the hospitalI know the one in my wife's car isn't all the way in right\n\nthat fucking thing will not tighten properly, I've done in 3 times now, seat belt is in there to compensate, but the anchor belt just won't properly tightenI find stuff like this so interesting. Like Freakonomics. Something which sounds totally sensible at a surface level which turns out to be useless.Can you just wander up to a fire station and ask for a car seat check, or is that a class kind of thing? I'm a babysitter and parents will just leave them for me without an explanation.I did everything I could to install our kids car seats  correctly. The people that checked them found a way to make them more secure just because they had done hundreds/thousands and I had done 2. Never hurts to get a sanity check from pros.I caught my best friend with a loose carseat strap on  baby yesterday. It's their first kid any they didn't know. They actively search for scientifically correct information but there's just so much information they need know.How did people learn to do that before \"parenting classes\" were a thing?Hospital teaches you before you leave anywayMost of that is done before you leave the hospital. At least it was with my kids.I was the burping and swaddling king... Everything else I was shit at, but when it was bedtime and he was getting his arms out like a ninja, she came to me. When she couldn't get that last burp out no matter how long she tried, I did my magic and got it out, sometimes before he even hit my shoulder.Soon to be new parent. I learned how to swaddle by looking up tutorials and practicing on my cat. [I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it!](https://imgur.com/a/YzFcbsM)Same with co-parenting classes post divorce.*don't think they need them. I\u2019d sayThe only thing my mother got out of the court ordered classes(multiple) was the exact wording needed to say to make the cops take my brother away in handcuffs.Yeah willingness to learn doesn't mean they already know everything. In fact I'd argue it shows self awareness that they *don't* know everything and need whatever the course is teaching.I knew nothing and took all the classes in a panic my last month. Good thing too, for one, breastfeeding is not at all intuitive and there are actual learned techniques involved, also, there are so many dangers I would have never thought about. If you have never held a baby or have been around children these classes give you a little bit of confidence and some knowledge to build on. Reddit filled in the rest (sorry baby).There are also more specialised parenting classes, like those for parents of kids who've been through trauma, and things like that. Those are definitely useful, and often voluntary.This person parents.This should be higher lmaoI\u2019m there with you. Mine is now 5 the best thing was when her teacher came up to my wife at pickup the other day and told that our daughter is a pleasure to teach. That she always is the first to pick up her things and helps the other kids in her class.\n\nShe\u2019s still a terrorist, especially when tired but that comment was really nice to hear. My wife and I both spent a lot of time wondering if we were doing it right. I still wonder if I am.\n\nGood luck with yours. It never gets easier just different.The only proof the parenting went well is seen much later in life when that child becomes a parent too (or not).r/suspiciouslyspecificCan confirm. Former visitation specialist.My wife and I took the first time parents and infant CPR classes for our first child. Then we did it again for our second child two years later. We were worried that we had forgotten too much since the last time. No regrets.Its not that it would hurt you to learn some things.  But the very fact that youre willing to try and learn means your instincts and intentions are probably fine.I feel that its more of a breakdown in traditional parent to children relationship that was meant to be a mentor-student relationship when you have your own kids. What I mean is that your parents were supposed to teach and guide you when YOU have your own kids. But the decline in this relationship in the US due to industrialization, urbanization, the size and the culture of the country and generational gaps have all contributed to many new parents having to learn from get goYeah, caring about how your kid is raised and wanting to do everything you can to do a good job, that's the reason we wentNah that's bullshit. I took a parenting class because I wanted to do everything possible to be ready to look after my kid. I'll take two hours off watching TV to maybe learn something that makes me a better parent.\n\nThinking you're above sitting in a room for two hours getting free advice about something that have no experience with is more of a red flag to be honest.If it's a good class, you don't need it after you take it. :)\n\nWhether you need it or not generally depends on how much experience you have had taking care of small children (siblings, baby sitting, day care worker) rather than your intentions. A class is not going to fix your intentions, either.Everybody needs the first time parents/infant CPR class.I don\u2019t recall which book I read this in, as I read a few... but children of parents who own parenting books do better than children of parents who own none. \n\nFor this study, it didn\u2019t matter if the parents read the books or not. Just owning the books was the difference. \n\nWhich matches what you have said. It\u2019s not the books that matter so much as the desire to be better parents.These commercials break my heart. Those and the \"read to your children\" commercials. I was shocked when I saw them the first time, and my best friend (she's a children's social worker) told me that I'm not the target audience, but some parents that she works with have seen the commercials and actually change their behavior because of it - so they're doing their jobyou'd be surprised by some parents>You should feed your children EVERY DAY and don\u2019t assault each other in front of them? Who knew?\n\nProbably not the adults who were abused/neglected as kids and don't have a good example to look toThat's the \"court ordered class\" class.  We took Circle of Security and most parents were obviously there voluntarily and it wasn't like that.  There were a few really sketchy looking parents who stopped coming, presumably they weren't forced to go but found it too abstract and huggy feely for their liking.a) you'd be surprised\n\nb) half the reason for that is so that if you're shitty to your kids, you don't have any \"how could I have known?!\" argumentYeah it\u2019s in a custody agreement for one of my buddies. He\u2019s just trying to get his 50% as is due to him (Nevada) and the mom brought it to the judge that he should have to, do now he does. I keep telling him to make her do it as well; it\u2019s only fair.My course was in a rough area of town. I can assure you there are people who need to be told this. \n\nI'm sorry your course was shite, mine was rough going too. In that group event, I heard from mothers who have partners in jail for all kids of things and their kids are out of control, joining street gangs, trying to be like their 'tough' father in jail.... There were ladies in there from abusive backgrounds, poor or without education or support, some of them trapped in the cycle of welfare and their kids out of control while they try to work or find direction. I was the only male there, I guess that about 80% of participants were unemployed, stay-at-home or just welfare dependents.\n\nThat course gave me a wake up when I saw how easy it is for kids to get involved in violence or gangs and hearing from those ladies how they deal with it was also pretty horrible. No wonder the kids are out of hand.\n\nHowever, if you can learn a negotiating technique for getting kids to understand street gangs are bad, you can learn a negotiating technique for getting your kids to eat their veggies and bath themselves without issues in the house.\n\nThe course, like any, is what you decide to take away from it.Never underestimate the stupidity of some people.Thank you for seeking advice and information about how to raise a child.I don't like thinking of it that way. I'm glad they're there to learn and help their baby. All of us had to learn somewhere.I mean, isn't that why they are in the class?It's not really ignorance if you're doing something about it.Now think of all the parents who DIDNT go :/It\u2019s not specific to parenting, my wife dragged me to this seminar thing on how to do a destination wedding when we were doing our planning.  One of the presenters mentions casually that if you get married in Mexico then your marriage certificate will written in Spanish and you shoukd consider the implications of that.  The kicks off an HOUR of stupid questions like \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t the Mexican government use English?\u201d or \u201cwhy would I need it translated?\u201dI took a new dad's class at the hospital given by a guy who I guess is on local radio. All of the materials said it would be a class on practical advice for dads.\n\nIt was two hours long and he spent about the first hour and a half high on his own farts talking about how you have to show up as a dad, and be a man and lead by example. He even made fun of a guy for saying he came to the class to learn to change a diaper. \n\nThe whole thing as him on an ego trip, it was embarrassing. I wanted to grab him by the ears and tell him that if we showed up we're already not hugely likely to be deadbeats, now teach us the practical stuff that was the whole fucking reason we came to the class.Yeah, if you adopt you have to bend over backwards to prove you\u2019re worthy; if you can biologically produce your own apparently no one cares if you\u2019re worthy.  Weird.That'd work just fine if we didn't constantly force people to become parents.\n\nLike if contraception and abortion were both free and accessible to all, sure, that's not the worst idea anyone's ever had.Wow was just about to write this. \n\nNo license = no family tax benefits, higher health insurance premiums and school fees. \n\nPeople need to learn to drive and get a driving license for the safety of themselves and other drivers. \n\nShouldn\u2019t raising a child be looked at the same way.It's a truly awesome experience to get to watch your s/o give birth to your children. I don't get why its so shocking to people. You know there's A LOT of blood, tissue and fluids. There's also feces and urine, from baby and mother.\n\nI watched the entire show from the foot of the bed for both of my daughters. I delivered my first because she was so premature (20 weeks) that it was an easy birth and she was given no chance to live. She lived for 5 hours after birth. \nI almost got to deliver my second but she was bigger than anticipated and was going into distress so dr performed an episiotomy and delivered. That was a bloody mess, for lack of better words. \n\nFunny story: My second daughter pooped on my wife's chest immediately after she was born.Ronaldo also didn't have a cryptic pregnancy.It honestly depends on the country too. Japan, for example, does promote cosleeping and their death rates are much lower than the US\u2019s (who takes a very firm position is if you so much as *think* about cosleeping, your child will die).>  I wouldn't have known not to sleep with the baby like that and killed it.\n\nThe thing is, if you're getting regular prenatal care, your doctor will straight up harass you to take the classes and avail yourself of other resources where you can learn things like this. \n\nBesides, the reality is that she probably wasn't planning on falling asleep anyway, and the whole thing was an accident. Accidents happen, and it's really shitty of people to bang on a Mom who likely already feels awful.The point is that you're taking the class because you have the intention of raising a child safely.Just keep in mind how much better off you are than the people with ADD that dont even bother.My cousin has anxiety and ADHD and her husband has dyslexia. They made an absolutely wonderful child and they're raising her well. My mom has panic disorder and my dad has OCD and they raised me and my brother well. Don't sell yourself short.Schizophrenia usually doesn't show signs until the early twenties. Long after parenting.This has nothing to do with schizophrenia. They're either wildly misinformed or there was an autocorrect accident. 90% of babies with mild ventriculomegaly have a typical outcome, however there is an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down's Syndrome. Baby may have disabilities once they are born.Don\u2019t leave your kid in the car when you run to the liquor store.Everyone can benefit from learning.  But the fact that you even had the forethought to sign up puts you miles ahead the parents who didnt care or think they know better.\"I'm a very stable genius.\" - President TrumpWe'd need to have a working foster system for that to be implemented.And how it's easier to make money when you already have money. If I already had money I wouldn't need to make more of it dammit!Ya thats why I specified voluntary.  My school has this new program to teach parents how to \"parent\".  Its voluntary, but I assume some of the people there have been \"highly recommended\" to attend.  But if youre self aware enough to realize you need help parenting, you probably dont need to be told how to do it by someone else.Yeah, I think a better way to put it is \"people who would never voluntarily take a parenting class are the people who most need it\" .Also I have met bad parents that were forced ti take classes. Also some that I thought sucked who took them willingly. I only found out they sucked after becoming friends and seeing how blantatly neglectful and downright dangerous they were. Ended up dropping then soon after can't deal with that shit or ill end up yelling how unsafe it is and telling then to stop.Son, let's stop the fussin' and the fuedin'.I think maybe you need to think about the definition of \u201cvoluntarily\u201dI'm not sure you understand the statement.  Everyone can benefit from learning.  but if you have the forethought to sign up for classes, you are already better off than the people who dont care or think they know better.Definitely yes. And I mean they would have most likely learned through trial and error but still.... Some of their thoughts. ShudderBut at the same time research has shown time and time again that it's pretty hard to fuck up a kid for life. Generally speaking if you're middle income or above a kid will turn out fine as long as you're not beating it or completely neglecting it.I think that's the point. Fact is no one is completely prepared to have a child. The people who sign up for the classes at least know they have plenty to learn. The opposite would be the people who think they have it all figured out but dont know their elbow from their asshole.My sister does it with her 2 and 1 year old. \"They like it!\" she says. Yeah, no shit it's liquid sugar. The parents themselves have soda to drink with breakfast so it's not surprising. She sees nothing wrong with it.I had a former co-worker tell me about his then ~4 year old son.  This poor kid had to be surgically operated on to cap, remove or somehow repair all but maybe 3 teeth when he had mandated preschool dental exams.  I was shocked and asked if he or his wife had any idea what had happened to make their child's teeth in such need of repair.\n\n\nApparently it never occurred to them that chocolate milk, sweet tea, or Kool-Aid at bedtime in a baby bottle from 12 months to the kids current age was actually pretty fucking unhealthy.The parents who do that are psychos so you just stfu and mind your own business. I've seen it a few times on the bus and just pray to god and satan both that the cavities don't hurt badlyIt's ok, I give her heroin to stop the cravingsI saw a toddler at a store once, in a stroller, with a half litre can of energy drink.\n\nI thought that bullshit only happens in America, but guess not.My wife worked at a hotel restaurant back in the day and had to get essentially infants soft drinks. She did not enjoy it, but was also shocked at how often it happened.Ha!  While I don\u2019t think it was ever in a bottle I remember drinking coke as early as 4 years old. I think that was par for the course in the 80sMy grandmother on my father's side used to give me coffee in a bottle... to go to sleep with.\n\nTo this day, if I'm in the right state of mind, a cup of coffee can help me fall asleep, it's strange.I actually knew a kid who had black baby teeth because their parents allowed them to drink soda nonstop no water no milk.I had a mom friend who was always giving her toddlers/preschoolers aged children sprite. I knew there was a problem when her toddler referred to sprite as \"juice\". I mean giving kids juice all the time is bad too but when a kid calls sprite \"juice\" wow[deleted][deleted]There is no requirement of qualification to be a parent, merely functional genitals.\n\nI think about this all the time and it really puts things in perspective and helps me understand why the world is the way it is.My mother, unfortunately was victim of this when she was a newborn. Her mother gave her cafecito because it was cheaper than a full bottle of formula... So it was coffee with a bit of formula mixed with milk.\n\nDon't ask why my mom wasn't nursed, it was the height of \"DOCTORS KNOW BEST, GOOD MOTHERS ALWAYS GIVE FORMULA IT'S THE MODERN SOLUTION\" craze.Are you talking soda water as in regular water with some carbonation or do you mean the highly sugary carbonated drinks like coke or fanta?[deleted]No dad, that's the lead pipes talking.[deleted]Yeah, boomers have lead poisoning and low key brain damage like that.Survivor bias, the kids without carseats who died can't argue why car seats are so great.\"\u00a0Blackroot! Didn't you ever hear that you never ever give a baby blackroot?\" \n\n\n\"\u00a0Nonsense! I was weaned on blackroot! It's good for her. Puts hair on her chest. Doesn't it Nibs?\"\n\n\n\"Her name is NOT Nibs! It's Elora Dannen, and she's a princess. And the last thing she's going to want is a hairy chest.\"Yeah, sprite's got electrolytes, it's what babies crave.[deleted]If I had gold I would give it just for human puppiesI think there's the risk of the baby rolling around and being suffocated by the blanketSIDS ( sudden infant death)is reduced by not using blankets for sleep.You can't even put stuffed animals in a crib. Nothing goes in the crib but baby.Everyone already answered you correctly but here is a link in case you wanted a source. \n\nhttps://consumer.healthday.com/environmental-health-information-12/environment-health-news-233/babies-still-sleeping-with-soft-bedding-despite-sids-risk-cdc-694118.htmlIt was a voluntary program that I worked in. None were forced to be there, all of them wanted to be.The Dunning-Kruger effectI think that's a really harmful view to have of society, really. I took parenting classes because fuck if I know how to take care of a baby before I had one. But as soon as I knew I was having a baby I knew I needed to get prepared.Awesome. So ridiculous and funny.like waterboarding?r/shittylifeprotipYeah. Honey, no matter how pasteurized, contains the chance to give botulism to infants.Yes. Pleaseours won't, due to liability reasonsMy baby was also a month early, before they would release her from NICU I had to prove the car seat base was installed properly. They had a nurse at the hospital who did installs/inspections   And of course mine wasn\u2019t in correctly either. I still refuse to take the base out after watching her put it in!Occasionally a garage will help you or there can be other services around that might.I wish I could show you, but like. You gotta cinch the straps before you click them into those little car seat brackets so they don't easily reach the bracket. Then using your knees to provide force push with your whole body until you can make the clip reach and click into the bracket.\n\nBut honestly you don't want it to be super taught. There needs to be some give in it.Have you consulted the user manual? I\u2019m not trying to be an ass, I was just surprised to learn a lot of seats recommend an actual pool noodle underneath to stabilize? Maybe they have some troubleshooting to recommend for that problem.You can just show up. Maybe call on your way so you can be sure they're there. Firefighters just hang out a lot of the day some places because they're (thankfully) not needed as often.I think it varies a lot, but it's definitely worth calling and asking. And good for you, you must be a great babysitterFamily that isn\u2019t always nearby anymore. Parenting isn\u2019t easy even if you do a bunch of preparation.People used to live in close-knit communities that spanned multiple generations. There were plenty of babies around and and taking care of them was everybody's responsibility. So the older generation would teach the younger. It's definitely not like that anymore.My mom works as a post-partum nurse (healing after the baby pops out) and the hospitals usually have required classes they make you participate in while you're still stuck being cleared to go home. Stuff like how to breastfeed and burp and change your baby that they know you're probably useless at since you've never had to interact with your own child before that point. They even have classes for husbands about what's going on hormonally with their wives and how to handle that. Pretty cool stuff actuallyHave 19 kids. Use trial and error.Usually a midwife would teach them.Homes used to be multigenerational, grandparents would stick around for a while.Parents and families but such support structures have disappeared for many. \nYou seem very ignorant about parenting.Family.\n\nIt used to be rare to have no family support. You were taught from your parents how to be parents. That's why some crazy shit \"wives tales\" got so common.\n\nAlso kids dying was super common.You might want to learn when you're not brutally sleep deprived though.36 weeks pregnant here and I'm taking a class tomorrow. Personally I'd like to be taught it before I'm sleep deprived and recovering from a major medical event like giving birth. They told me I need to spend most of my short hospital stay sleeping and trying to figure out breastfeeding and that will be plenty.Umm, not at my hospital! There was NOTHING! Not even a Lactation Consultant.That big burp letting loose. Such a great feeling.That's quite a patient cat there. Our cat doesn't mind a blanket over her, but she hates being stuck.Is that actually a thing? If not, it should be.Often they are court mandated\n\nSource: my mother does intake for and runs them for a livingI went to take them but I went into it all 'my wifes been reading a ton so I'm sure we're good'\n\nNope. Was super blown away and was furiously taking note. It was super focused on preventing SIDS. And they said with the current philosophy and techniques to handle baby - ex: Back is best and stuff.. SIDS was down like 70% or something crazy.\n\nSo it was very interesting to have to tell the grandparents, 'no this is how we do things now.' They even offered a class specifically for grandparents to learn the current methods.I can't even begin to imagine the twisted shit you must have seen.  Thank you for your service to children, one of the most poorly represented groups ever.  Women were liberated and the slaves were freed but children are still treated as property.  Any two trailer park crackheads can shit out a human being which becomes their \"property\" to care for.  It's a sad, sad, sad state of affairs for children.I would argue intentions yes, instinct to do right by the kid, yes, but instinct to actually parent properly and effectively not necessarily.You cannot simply parent on instincts.  There are actual things you need to know.Lol no it's more like parents 20-30 years ago did a lot of stuff that everyone thought was fine at the time but now we realize was pretty dangerous, so getting some up to date advice from experts is a really good idea.\n\nSource: multiple people have told me my two year old only needs to be in a car seat on long drives.Wow even just owning them. It's like they give off a magical parenting energy :p . But to be real, I understand what you mean, the intention to buy the books are enough to make them a better parent than those who didn't try to learn at all. Hell we're not even trying until next month but I've already bought two books, so I hope this is true \ud83d\ude05This is from FreakonomicsThis makes me feel better about owning a bunch of parenting books but only having read a couple of pages from like 2 of them...Yup. A lot of kids don\u2019t even know they\u2019re being neglected or abused. Especially if they live in a community where most parents are fairly absent or highly mobile due to work or... other things. \n\nOne of my high school students (who is happily now in a good foster home) was joking the other day about he had no idea it was illegal to leave little kids at home alone overnight with a dog. He seriously thought it was like Wendy and her siblings in Peter Pan.exactly, that's the point of the class lolRight? It's not ignorance if they're trying to learn betterThat's why I was in the class. I knew jack shit about babies. My wife and I didn't have any younger siblings. No nieces or nephews. None of our friends had kids yet. I never held a baby. Now I think of it, I don't think I ever really met a baby besides ones in public that would maintain an awkward level of eye contact.Doing something is a remedy to correct ignorance, though. Willful ignorance, now *there's* a problem.Wow I had no idea there was a cultural difference with this, and still have trouble believing the stance against co-sleeping in the US is supposed to be obvious.We were advised against it, but Sprog 1 couldn't sleep alone. In the end we wheeled her cot over next to our bed and dropped the side, so she got the impression she was in with us.Good point. Thank you.We do make amazing entrepreneurs so there\u2019s that. My kids been making money selling things at school since he was pretty young. \nI make lots of money because I\u2019m an obsessive networker and impulsive so hey \ud83d\ude18I wrote that down. Okay but what if I leave the keys in the car? Still no? And is this just the liquor store or......Aw thx.Ahh I completely spaced and didn't see voluntarily(Finger rubbing on leg)\n\nCome here you!Let\u2019s not get into a debate on free will>trial and error   \n  \n\n\"Well fuck, there goes another one.\"I would think you would find your work meaningful and feel you are making a huge difference in the world.  Do you?What is fucking up a kid for life tho? Irreparable damage or just self loathing and axiety?I feel like fucking up a kid for life is alarmingly easy if you're a terrible person.There is also a lot of research that shows the opposite. \n\n \n\n>The\u00a0[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_Childhood_Experiences_Study)\u00a0(ACE Study) is a research study conducted by the U.S.\u00a0health maintenance organization\u00a0Kaiser Permanente\u00a0and the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[1]\u00a0Participants were recruited to the study between 1995 and 1997 and have been in long-term follow up for health outcomes. The study has demonstrated an association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (aka\u00a0childhood trauma) with health and social problems across the lifespan. The study has produced many scientific articles and conference and workshop presentations that examine ACEs.[1]Source?\n\nSounds like an odd studyUmmm no.  Neglect in the first 12 months of life is irreversible.  Loss of ability to empathize.  Look up the causes of severe antisocial disorders.[deleted]My parents were upper middle class, raised me right, and I've been hella fucked up my whole life.I\u2019m not sure I buy that. SIDs, obesity, and self esteem issues can be pretty lasting and can be caused unintentionally.I'm going to go out on a limb and say \"middle income\" has nothing to do with it. You can be poor as shit and as long as you ( A ) treat your kid well/spend time with them ( B ) keep them clothed/fed, they'll be fine.Yah tell that to my perpetually pissed off brother haha. He got all the attention and turned out like a bastard.I don't know what research you are referring to but no.  Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are the most prescribed in the country.  Look at our opiate and alcohol addiction rates.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/acestudy/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/acestudy/index.html)Unfortunately there\u2019s still a large portion of the population that will beat/emotionally abuse/neglect their children because that\u2019s what their parents did to them.  \n\nI agree with you. I think a better wording is that it\u2019s hard to fuck your kids up if you are financially secure and a generally decent person. It\u2019s a whole lot easier if you\u2019re a shitty person (or the result of the cycle of abuse). Then it\u2019s going to be hard to raise your kid correctly, because you have to actively fight being shitty to your kid. And if you\u2019re shitty enough, you really won\u2019t care enough to try. \n\nA study done in 1997 indicated that only 37% of children faced no common childhood traumas before the age of 18.Besides abuse and neglect though, over-coddling a child and doing everything for them can mess them up for life too as it prevents them from learning important life skills and independence.Let\u2019s raise our children to be excellent *because* of their childhood, not *despite* their childhood.Functional /= not fucked upThey\u2019re banned from r/hydrohomiesI'm always awed by parents that don't realize they're forming an entire human with a lifespan that will eclipse theirs (hopefully), not just the small child they see before them. That they can't look past this (possibly) cute, sticky little flesh gremlin, which is a temporary stage, and see that their child will one day be an adult... an adult that they have fully and incomprehensibly failed on so many levels by treating them like this.\n\nYou don't raise what will be a person on the basis of \"what they like,\" if you go solely by what they like then they'll never brush their teeth, never take a bath, and only eat candy and chicken nuggets. Kids are idiots. They're all id and self-gratification, they literally cannot conceive of the long term. That's why adults make decisions.The thought of drinking soda as soon as I wake up is nauseating.I got so mad at your sister that I downvoted your comment. Had to come back and change it after the red faded from my vision.The worst part is it's easy to 'trick' your kids.  My 2 year old get 'dessert' almost every night. She thinks an apple or other piece of fruit is dessert.  \n\nThere is just no reason to give kids that young crap.On a scale from 1 to 10, how fat are these people?My grandma bottle fed me Sprite and to this DAY (young adult now, mid-twenties) I have a terrible soda habit that's been virtually impossible to kick. I could also drink soda with breakfast if I chose (try not to, lol).Your sister is definitely unfit to be a parent...... I mean I don't even know what to say. My kids are nearly 5,3&2 the younger 2 havn't even tastes soft drink, while the eldest didn't like the bubbles so we are just riding that for as long as we can.\nThey only get juice or milkshakes at most once a week and the juice is only 100% juice that's watered down.[The truth](https://pics.me.me/actual-photo-of-me-trying-to-change-my-kids-diaper-32041346.png).This is why you pin it down with your wives hands. Or your forehead.They never doThey should just use cats.Not even a single knitted or crocheted baby blanket that\u2019s filled with holes?It is idiocracy in the making dude.Yeah, \u201cquite fine people\u201dHa, yeah.\n\n'Yes, gramps, but of nine siblings only two thirds of you made it to adulthood, so forgive me if I don't follow your advice to the letter.'Yeah, lead pipes are only a problem when you are pumping highly acidic water through them, which will also destroy the pipes after a couple years. The main reason we stopped using lead pipes is because of plumbers who would be continuously exposed to fresh lead on a daily basis in large amounts whenever they did any work.Ugh yeah, some people might even suggest water! The thing in toilets! Disgusting.I was wondering what a human donut hole is.Are you just supposed to keep the temperature good so that they don\u2019t need covered up?Guessing that's 'mericaProbably for the best. It's way better to teach the parent how to install it. I've had to switch our car seat to another vehicle a good few times. What would those parents do in this situation? Best to actually learn.It seems like it's kinda going back to that in some places. There's a few families I know of - including my own - that pretty much agreed to stick together. Everyone has a job and/or pulls their own weight, but still remain at home. It's a lot easier and more productive than trying to make it on your own.Also even learning from your own parents might not be a good idea, things change, we learn new things, new products are developed. What your parents did 25-40 years ago might not be best.Good thing as well, some things the older women in our families tell us are... Well outright ridiculous if not harmful lol.\n\nMy favorite is my aunt telling me that we had to throw a diaper filled with poop onto the roof and let it dry so that she poop wellAnd people used to have more kids so the old kids (older girls really) would take care of younger siblings and cousins etc. so they would just learn as part of all the other household responsibilitiesLol, I hear ya with my mom and MIL telling me to rub whiskey on my son\u2019s gums when he was teething... pretty sure when my kid shows up to daycare drunk on whiskey, I\u2019m getting CPS called on me!They aren\u2019t really classes, they just have specialists that come by and help you with things. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s required by you to attend, it\u2019s that they are required to come by and see you and teach you this shit. \n\nSource: by my third child we were just sending them on their way and asking where the AMA form was.This is a decent answer. Also, I would recommend listening to nurses at the hospital. Generally speaking they are solid as well.So when they're 10?Please be very careful!  I took the \u201chow not to kill your baby\u201d class at 36 weeks, but they kept making us get up and down on the floor.  About an hour in, I was struggling, so my husband helped me up, pulling me slightly off center....and I heard a loud \u201cPOP\u201d.  Turns out I tore the ligament connecting my pubic symphasis (the joint at the front of your pelvis).  I was on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy and did physical therapy for a year afterwards to try and learn how to hold my pelvis together manually so my hips would work correctly.  Stairs were excruciating, it was difficult getting in and out of the car, and if I sat too long my left hip wouldn\u2019t work right.  It was even worse with the second pregnancy...bed rest from about 33 weeks, the baby almost fell out because my pelvis was too open, caused his placenta to rupture, and I had to be rushed for an emergency D&C and a couple of transfusions from the blood loss.  Took 1.5 years of physical therapy that time to walk without pain, and I still have trouble with my hip seizing if I don\u2019t foam roll every day (glutes & core get really tight from holding my pelvis stable all day).  There are still some things I can\u2019t do, and I don\u2019t think that will ever improve.  I\u2019ll probably have to have hip replacement at some point.  You have a LOT of relaxin in your system at this stage, so all of your tendons and ligaments are extremely soft.  Please be careful <3 and congratulations on the upcoming baby!My husband was required to take a parenting class when we went to court to get full custody of his son. We won our case and we went stemming from a founded COS case against the mother, but nonetheless we had to pay for and go to a parenting class. It was honestly very helpful and I went with him to the class as support for him, but also cause being a stepmom to a 6 year old is fucking hard. 6 year olds are fucking hard.Yah, here in AZ it was mandated.They are. At least where I am. I love them, and look forward eagerly to the updated classes. They've enabled me to create a radical bond with my kids. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I try I can't get my ex wife to take them seriously. \n\nBut she is a professional, apparently, considering her friend sent her a video that she used to diagnose me as a narcissist.My ex-wife and I were required to take a co-parenting class during our divorce.  (We didn't take it together.)  It wasn't much of a class, maybe 30 minutes long, mostly spent watching a video on why you shouldn't bash each other infront of your child.  Common sense stuff.It\u2019s required in UtahTbh the social workers deserve most of the credit, being on the front lines, seeing the worst, coordinating the fall out. I just made sure parents were following visitation rules after removal and documented whether they were actually learning something in parenting class. Saw my fair share of shit too, but nothing compared to what I heard from the first responders. Had the chance to move on as a social worker but had to say no, since just supervising visits and teaching classes had fucked me up a bit. I will say, being in the field definitely changed my stance on abortion.> Wow even just owning them. It's like they give off a magical parenting energy... the intention to buy the books are enough to make them a better parent\n\nAlmost, but not quite. Part of it is definitely that if they're buying the books, even if they're not reading them, they're probably doing _other things_ that make them better parents. Interest counts for a lot, if it's followed up on at all.\n\nBut part of it is also that buying books about things is a pretty good proxy for wealth and education, both of which result in more free time to spend with kids, which is a big part of positive outcomes.Or they have disposable income to buy books.It sure was. Great book.Well, ignorance, as I've always had it explained, is by definition willful as opposed to being uninformed or uneducated.\n\nThis definition from Wikipedia is how I've always taken it:\n\n>The word \"ignorant\" is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being unaware, and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts.\n\nThe key word being \"ignore,\" however I'm aware that this is not necessarily the definition commonly used.  I think most people use it interchangeably with \"uneducated\"People believe a lot of things about raising children. One of the things you should learn about life and children is that honestly, as long as you're not a dickhead, they tend to be pretty resilient.For almost three decades in the US there have been huge promotions of safe sleeping habits with newborns and when you go to prenatal visits, social service departments, etc you are given hours and hours and hours and stacks and stacks and stacks of information about how you will risk killing your child if you don\u2019t have them in a safe sleep space and what it is that safe sleep means. People get so pissed about this because when you\u2019re in parenting groups (mostly on Facebook) there\u2019s so many people who have been given this information and respond with, \u201cI coslept with all of my babies and they\u2019re fine!\u201d Neglecting all of the statistics with anecdotal evidence. I even saw someone call a woman a dumb bitch for saying please practice safe sleep, turns out she had lost a baby and didn\u2019t want others to lose babies as well.\n\nOf course there\u2019s exceptions where parents don\u2019t have this information, which is unfortunate. And I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m pro, or anti-cosleeping; I think there\u2019s exceptions and circumstances for every parent but I would never encourage it and 90% of the time it\u2019s needless deaths and injuries from not ignorance but resistance to medical advice.My cousin's husband who has dyslexia is a part time beekeeper, full time guy who builds exhibits for science museums across the USCrack the windows on hot days.I was mostly just sticking to \u201cif it\u2019s forced then it\u2019s literally not voluntary\u201d\"Well now we know for the next one not to use it as a hacky sack\"Damn I guess I gotta vaccinate the next oneThat's pretty much how humanity worked until just a few short decades ago, still is how it works in poorer places.r/cursedcommentsThat's why you have 10 or 12.

I just made a comment about aces.Source: It's me im the study... i turned out fine i guessThat's half the wealth, not half the population. PM Me Your Dark Secrets comment is even crazier than you realize.That refers mostly to living at a level where your parent can\u2019t (or refuse to) provide for your basic needs (clothing, food, shelter, etc.). Poverty and physical neglect are huge stressors to children and make it much more likely for them to engage in risk taking behaviors or have poor mental health as adults. \n\nThink always having to worry about where your next meal is coming from or if you\u2019ll have electricity this month, or if your mom can afford to buy you shoes that fit. \n\nLong term stress is super bad for young, squishy brains.They would say that you would have been fucked up regardless then.Now would someone who is self-proclaimed to be fucked up really know the difference between good and bad parenting?I like your comment.\n\nHere's a simplification to help people get the idea for others.\n\nMore $ = Less issues = Less Stress\n\nLess stress = Less negative feelings\n\nLess negative feelings = more happy\n\nMore happy = less shitty you'll be to others and family\n\nless shitty you are to family = happy family\n\nhappy family = less stress \n\nrepeatYou also shouldn't give newborns up to about 9/12 months old water either. Not until they're getting a larger portion of calories from solid foods, otherwise the water just displaces room for the milk which is all the calories they get. Giving them water can starve them. sticky little flesh gremlin\n\nLOL too accurateJokes on you, my kids love baths. lol>They're all id and self-gratification, they literally cannot conceive in the long term.\n\nYou're talking about the parents here right?I love so much of what you just said.Well most people dont realizing they are driving a raging death machine and the only thing keeping it from killing people is their attention. And that has a direct immediate impact on their day and life. So...\n\nI can see how they cant see far enough ahead to conceptualize their crotchgoblins will one day be crotchety orcs.They are mormon and choose not to drink coffee. How else are they gonna get their caffeine? Wish I was joking.Unfortunately, this stops working when they go to school :( my kids ate so much better before they realized it was \u201cstrange\u201d to eat vegetables.But it is. You don't need cake for dessert.To be fair, fruit also has a high sugar content and tastes good. Definitely better than candy or cake though!Same here!  I love that my 5 year old hates anything carbonated and when my 1 year old gets juice it's actually 2/3 water.  My sister gives almost 2 year old Dr. Pepper and tons of just crap to eat.  She has failure to thrive and is in a diaper size smaller than her 8-month-younger cousin.I'm so thankful that as a kid my parents never introduced me to soda and wouldn't let me drink it. Now as an adult I still don't drink soda and I never plan on starting. I just drink water 90% of the time.[deleted]Nothing at all is safest. We don't know what causes SIDS, but preventing accidental suffocation and strangulation is important.  There are baby sleep sacks to keep them warm if needed.Our pediatrician told us our newborns crib should look like \u201cSoviet Russia\u201d. Tight fitted crib sheet and nothing else.Realistically you can have stuff in there.  It does increase the chance of SIDS/suffocation but really the internet acts like it\u2019s instant death for a baby to have a stuffed animal.\n\nIf you want to minimize risk you put nothing in the crib.  Everything you put in adds risk.  Personally with my son we\u2019ve been fine breaking some of the rules.The issues with it is that newborns & infants have very little head/body control. That slowly develops over the first 6 months but until then, they can unintentionally roll over, pull a blanket to their face, wiggle into a stuffed animal, etc. and lack the body control or know-how to get out of it and not suffocate. Baby cant cry out much at that point so unless your're staring at the baby 24/7, you may not know until its too late. Putting nothing in the crib with the baby also reduces risk of SIDS, which has yet to have a specifically defined cause. \n\nCo-sleeping it is also heavily advised against for the same reason on the parents bed plus the added risk a parent rolling onto the infant. Middle of the night breastfeedings are easier with the baby right next to you so people still do it, despite the significant safety risk. Survivor bias, i.e. my mom did it and I lived/I did that with my last kid and he was fine, perpetuates this willful denial of consequences despite the research showing co-sleeping is dangerous. Just like leaving kids in a hot car; \"That will never happen to me.\" Until it does. Happens more frequently then we all realize. \n\nSource: I'm a FA CPR, car seat and new parent fundamentals instructorFish shit in itActually, water really isn't good for babies. Infants should only receive breast milk or formula.Sleep sacks are a safer alternative.That, and if it's chilly such as in the winter, you put warm pajamas on them. They also make a thing called a sleep sack now that's like a wearable baby blanket, a baby snuggie if you will.Another alternative to the sleep sack is a good tight swaddle. Once baby can roll around this isn't an option, but it's great the first few months.I live in America and my local FD and PD will do it for you.More like a shitty local representative, but you do you.Lol its a clusterfuck of battling ideals here. I married and moved into this mess, and I'm about to lose my fucking mind.Maybe we're not in the majority, but our families are 6-8 hour drive away and we don't have space to house them, so our families only see our daughter via Google Hangouts/ in person twice a year max. I think it's pretty common in cities. Frankly we're lucky to have a two parent home,  loving (but distant grandparents), money for daycare, stable jobs, and a decent house, but it's still hard with no family close by. We do have parenting groups and friends, but again we see those people once per 2-3 months.\n\nI can't even imagine being a single parent with a job and no family. My wife went away for two weeks internationally (our daughter is over 16 months old) and I about had a nervous breakdown trying to do everything myself and work. I guess you can get used to anything...\n\nPoint blank, it's hard no matter what I think - but preparation, money, family, and friends make it way easier.I guess it depends on personality. I have siblings that I could easily live with, and others where we would go crazy if we were together too often.Yup, my parents and I have agreed to live within reasonable driving distance. We have both forgone some career opportunities because of this, but this has helped us immensely to stay close, and in child rearing.What?>Good thing as well, some things the older women in our families tell us are... Well outright ridiculous if not harmful lol.\n\nA friend of mine has a great rule of thumb - ignore any advice from anyone who hasn't had a kid in 10 years.\n\nWe've got two kids and I find it to be broadly accurate. Even my sister in law who's super clued in thought back sleeping was \"whatever's trendy now\" until I explained how effective it is.People do the same thing with horses. LolA few drops wouldn't get then drunk. Also wouldn't help much, but it wouldn't get then drunk!Our local hospital had actual classes that my wife and I attended before our baby was born. Things like \u201call about childbirth\u201d, \u201cbreastfeeding\u201d, and \u201ccaring for your child\u201d. \n\nIf you take three you get a free car seat.We had a nurse teach Pa how to swaddle properly before leaving the hospital. We got very little sleep but what tiny sleep we did get is credit to the nurse\u2019s expert swaddle.Yay only 5 years to go!Yeah I know parenting classes are a thing but I meant co-parenting.\n\nAlso, I'm glad you had a good outcome. Becoming a step-parent to a kid beyond age 2/3 is extremely difficult, I am glad you are there for him. 6 year old are definitely not easy at all, I'm not stoked for my niece to hit that point in a couple years, her older sister was a shit head at that age. (I still adore both of them to bits tho)I've been a pretty involved uncle, and honestly I started liking my nephews a lot more when they turned 5 and 6. Definitely a lot easier to deal with at that age.You're a good person.The post assumes anyone well-meaning has all necessary skills. I know that's not true, especially if people didn't watch younger siblings.  \n\nMost people do manage to muddle through and raise their kids without lessons, but I've know people can use advice on child psychology, handling medical issues, and nutrition.  I don't know how good Arizona's classes are.I wonder if we have it here. Such a good idea.We were required to do it because i filed for child support. Its been 8 years and he still makes excuses in court every time for why he still hasnt done it.Crazy! It sounds like it's a good thing your relationship came to an end then. I'm glad you had the resource, I'm going to do some research and see if we have something like that here. My brother and his ex are terrible at the co-parenting thing and my niece is suffering for it.Sadly a lot of people don't understand that though.\n\nAlthough they are usually the people bashing each other in front of the kids during the relationship so I suppose that's not surprising.> I will say, being in the field definitely changed my stance on abortion.\n\nI bet it also influenced your thinking on overpopulation, sex ed, and a whole bunch more.  I can't imagine working in a field like that; it takes a sort of gravitas that I just do not possess.  I have enough trouble with the douchery in a white collar office job that manufactures meaningless garbage.Umm, I think you missed part of what you shared.\n\n> describes a person in the state of being unaware, and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, **or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts.**\n\nSo what's the bolded part of your definition, decoration?And that cosleeping is usually ok as long as yours not drunk or high.Something tells me you are neither married nor have children \u2014 could also just be a lack of humor., though.\"And that's how we lost your brother Hacky-sack.  Now will you go grab me a beer Knife-accident.\"~~Football~~\n\n~~Basketball~~\n\n~~Hacky Sack~~\n\nI'm starting to think my sports genes didn't pass on.Goddamn.*aggressively marks off list*r/cursedcommentsIs that why he stopped moving? I thought he was just tired.Had to learn that the hard way with my second one\u201cDo we?

We are the result of thousands of generations of animals that managed not to get themselves killed in time to breed.THAT'S why lose the ability to express anything when I'm angry... or sad.Our generation has the best pranks.That's the best thing that has happened to me. I have a reputation at work as a stone cold killer because anyone who yells at me gets stared down for a minute and a half. They usually get awkward by that time  and start back peddling. In reality im completely frozen that entire time and by the time I recover the client is cowed by my dead eyed stare.I try to not do this to my son, when he is angry or crying I tell him to calm down and talk to me and tell me what's wrong.  He's a kid, he is going to have bad days and I want him to know its okay and he can talk to me about it*That's not fuck up at all*And depression, they've forgot depressionIs it reallyFace tattoos is another.Perhaps very well indeed.That's really good to know, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks!Was trying to figure out what's so bad about giving kids *old water* to drink.  Then I discovered reading comprehension.Well fuck, looks like I\u2019m enrolling in parenting classesDef saving this in the unlikely chance I become a parentLike giving ducks bread. Man kids really are just animals. I cannot say that enough. I mean adult humans are too, but the parallels when it comes to young children to many animals is very solid and numerous.Every child of a certain age I've ever met has been sticky, their face, their hands, at this point I'm starting to think they secrete some kind of adhesive, for what purpose I do not know.I think the idea is that it's not about what they want, but what they need. It's an added bonus if they also want to do what they need to do.Are you sure your kids aren't amphibian?How is coffee not ok but soda is? Is that a mormon thing?Ha like the Mormons from South Park that adopted Cartman and only had Dr pepper to drink. How do they always hit it spot on?Rail crushed NoDoze like a normal person?Oh wow that is both heartbreaking and rage-inducing. I want to kick your sister in the shins and then lecture her *firmly.*What about when holding them? Blanket okay then?\n\nSerious question since I do want a baby someday, just don't wanna screw them up.I\u2019ve heard various things about baby sleeping positions.\n\nI was thinking when I had a baby to have some kind of incline under them and have them on his back. Head just up right, or do you turn it to the side so if they spit up they won\u2019t choke? That\u2019s a big concern of mine.Ok, I didn\u2019t know this thing about blankets at all but I\u2019m  glad I do now. Maybe it would\u2019ve come up once I was pregnant though.\n\nSo just keep heat on a comfortable temperature in the house and a baby onesie. Are hats ok while they sleep? I\u2019d think it could slip off and become a problem though.No one acts like it's instant death. Instead, we listen to careful science which has shown there are factors that can increase the risk of suffocation or SIDS. Having stuffed animals in the crib is one of them.\n\nPersonally, I don't see any reason to choose to increase risks for your child dying. A newborn doesn't care either way if there's a stuffed animal in the crib with it or not, so I don't see any compelling reason to do it.Sleep sacks are the shit. We had three that we just rotated out. So simple and very safe.Same sameSame here in texasDifferent people have different needs. Hope you sort it out or are able to cordially move out.My husband is military and we live a 10 hour plane ride from our closest family.Exactly.\n\nAlso it's \"mandatory\" to burn the umbilical cord when it falls, because if you throw it in the trash and a mouse takes it your child will become a thief.\n\nBUT WAIT! There's a cure! You need to capture a live mouse, make a soup  with it and feed it to your child!\n\nI tell ya, the community thing about caring for children is awesome in many ways, but boi am I glad there are professionals now who actually know what they're talking about and why, not just dogmatic superstitionIt's such an absurd taste for the baby it normally distracts them from whatever was making them cry in the first place. It's usually not teeth anyways so they assume it magically worked.[deleted]My step dad came into my life when I was 6. Within 6 months, I had suffered a serious injury (2nd & 3rd degree burns on my foot). My actual father got thrown out of the hospital for causing too big a scene. My step father held me until the ambulance showed up, and stayed in the room with me as they had to clean the burn, when my mom couldn't watch because she couldn't stand to see me in that kind of pain. That day, my step father became my father. That was 21 years ago, and last year I named my first born son after him.5 and 6 are great ages as far as their wit, fearlessness mixed with a lack of self-awareness, and run-on storytelling. I think the part I find the hardest is that 6 year olds are new to school still, and are going through so many changes that your dealing with a lot of emotions. And the littles feel all the emotions but can't really process them appropriately, so it takes a lot to figure out what's wrong and help them deal with it. They also ask some very complex and profound questions that make me ELI5 a lot. We learned about levers and fulcrums last weekend when he helped me change my tire. Boy over here asking \"why is it easier to use the pipe instead of just the black thing?\" (I use a hollow pipe for some extra leverage to loosen the lugnuts cause it's easier and I don't like jumping on the shortass wrench that comes with the car cause I'm not trying to break sweat ;)Big ups to dope uncle's. Funcles over here>The post assumes anyone well-meaning has all necessary skills.\n\nNot in the slightest.  This post is the exact opposite.  Everyone can benefit from more learning.  But if youre the type of person that cares enough about your kids to try and be better youre already SIGNIFICANTLY better off than the people who dont care or think they know it all.Absolutely it did. That\u2019s hilarious though. Not to belittle your problems in the office, I\u2019m sure your complaints are totally valid. But I\u2019m actually trying SO hard right now to transition to a nice excruciatingly boring office job where people\u2019s lives or well being aren\u2019t on the line. After six years of losing hope in humanity I\u2019m at my limit. No bites yet unfortunately.That's the part I was saying most people refer to, while the section prior to that is the definition I useSound advice.Wrong on both counts actually.  Could be that you\u2019re just not as funny as you think.I love how we name our current child after the way the last one died. I miss bus tire.I only have a poop knife. \n\nAnd don\u2019t call me accident.It helps if you are 6\u2019 9\u201d and covered in tattoos.[( XKCD cough )](http://xkcd.com/573/)Also for the love of god, don\u2019t give them honey.I'm a bit stoned and yeah I just spent a full minute thinking \"wtf is old water? Is there new water? How do you know?\" \n\n\nI need to go to bedI\u2019m wondering if you also thought the water was 9/12ths of a month old!\nAround 22 to 23 days.\nI guess I wouldn\u2019t drink it if it\u2019s been sitting out that long either!The one we took was a weekend course (9-5 Saturday, 9-1 Sunday) that also included a tour of the facilities. About half of it was parenting, half of it was the birthing process. Definitely worth the time just to ease some of the nerves. Looking back, it doesn't help a ton since there's just so much to know. The real thing is basically just learning on the fly and trying to find sleep. All that said, worthwhile especially considering the time involved. Pardon any typos or confusion, I'm constantly mentally exhausted :DI only know this because I have a 5 month old and learned it in a parenting class put on by the hospital. Quality class, already knew most of what I needed as I have a dozen nieces and nephews, but it really did help in many ways.oh totally, I was just joking around.Because coffee, tea, tobacco, and alcohol are officially banned by the church. Caffeine from other drinks is newer and so is just advised against but not outright banned.\n\nI was originally going to say they had a stake in pepsi or cocacola, but decided to check snopes first.[deleted]If you're holding them (and you're awake) that's totally fine.[deleted]Unless baby is sedated with something sleeping in their back is fine.  Humans have a reflex that stops them suffocating like that and you have to drink a lot of booze or do a bunch of downers to suppress that reflex.Choking is less of a hazard than SIDS. Babies have reflexes to deal with spit up, but babies do not have the neck muscles to lift their head of they need more oxygen from sleeping on their stomachs. \"Back to sleep\" is the safest way to put a baby to sleep.\n\nNo blankets, pillows, toys, stuffed animals, bumpers.New dad here of a 3 month old. Our parenting/birthing classes were all pretty clear, dress the baby the way you'd dress. If it's cold enough to wear long pants, baby should probably have long pants. Need a jacket? So does baby.\n\nFor sleeping, you can swaddle them in sleep sacks to keep them warm and comfy. Hats are ok on newborns, our hospital has knitted ones donated from local knitters.\n\nOur little one wears footie pj's and his sleep sack and is sleeping great. We keep the house around 70-74 and haven't had any issues. \n\nI'd highly recommend looking into birthing and parenting classes once you're pregnant. If you're not used to taking care of a baby, they cover all the basics and explain the whole process. Was a huge eye opener for me and helped put my wife at ease.[deleted]Hats are definitely a no no.Babies don\u2019t need hats indoors.  They release most of their heat through their head and they don\u2019t sweat so there is a risk of overheating.You can get little baby sleeping bags (ours were all from Slumbersac, but others are available, I'm sure) with arm and leg holes. Keeps the little buggers warm but doesn't have enough freedom of movement to slip and smother them.One reason to break the rules is that your child doesnt sleep longer than 30 minutes following the safe sleep rules and you are going insane from sleep deprivation. Thats one reason.I live in Dallas and you can\u2019t here. They have some special place you can go run by the city, but you just can\u2019t go to the local station anymore.Wtf traditions are these from lol\u201cIt\u2019s usually not teeth anyways...\u201d\n\nAmen!  Dear Lord, my MIL tried to blame everything on teething. Even when there was a plainly obvious reason why the baby was crying, like if I saved the cat from his sticky clutches. \n\nNever once was it teething.Ok, I have to admit this- I just posted on a thread where people complained about seeing breastfeeding women and telling them to cover up, and I mentioned my kid would scream because he couldn't eat under the cover.\n\nI was REALLY trying to figure out what the absurd taste was in that situation! Did my boobs taste different in the dark?Sorry I'm in the bathroom, the only place I get privacy, so that would be weird.I'm so sorry you had to go through all that but I'm really glad that you have a great step-dad.\n\nMy step-dad came into our lives when I was 12. He's been the only Dad I've ever known and he's gotten our family though so much, we're all so thankful for him. I can only imagine how hard it was for him, going from being a single guy to essentially the only parent to a 12 year old girl and 18 year old guy for months at a time because our mom was in the hospital.Wow, that's amazing. I hope my stepson can look back and see how much I've loved him since the day we met. When I got with his father the mother was a monster meth head and alcoholic and my husband (bf at the time) was working 60 hours a week to provide an amazing life for his son while bio mom is out getting high and doing all sorts of crazy things you'd expect from someone on meth. When I moved in with them I encouraged my boyfriend to go to court to get custody and set some very clear guidelines. Baby mama has been sober for a year now, is still a nightmare to deal with, but now I feel like my son isn't in danger like he definitely was before. I'm so glad you have a great relationship with your stepdad. It's very hard being a stepparent, and you recognizing what he did for you and reminding him that you love him will mean everything for him to hear. I'm tearing up just typing this thinking about the way my baby sounds when he tells me he loves me. There's no greater feeling in the worldI'm not gonna vouch for any group, most especially humanity as a whole, but I will say that I know well more than a handful of people who are really worthy humans.  Hang in there.\n\nGood luck with the job hunt.  That's a game I'm basically incapable of playing.No one will ever be the child Lost-In-Hospital-Parking-Lot could have been. She had real promise.It's unfortunate that his '13' tattoo was drawn as a '31' by the artist.I did know about honey. I have a niece and a nephew, so I probably know more about babies than I should for my age!Coo, coo... I'm a pigeon. ;pJoking isn't good for kids, you're messing up your flesh gremlins.Thank ya. I know that sounded dumb, but I've never had a baby and only held a few in my life for a short time.But would I position their face so they\u2019re looking at the ceiling, or do I put it so they\u2019re kind of facing the wall? I think that would just be a concern or issue when they\u2019re newborns and the neck muscles are weak.Ah ok. I just knew it could happen to babies sometimes but I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how it happens or how I would do my best to prevent it from happeningThat reflex takes a while to kick in. Which is why there\u2019s rules about placing babies on their back and no soft bedding. Because they can\u2019t move their head away if they are smothering. Which is one of the biggest causes of SIDS.Parenting classes are my plan. I don\u2019t want to have a kid until I\u2019m in my 30s. My mom is bipolar and she also got schizophrenia when she was 27 and I was 3, parents separated at 5, and divorce finalized at 7. My biggest fear is ending up like my mom, and an even more concern is having a child when it happens and having to leave them like how my mom had to leave me and leaving my boyfriend/future husband alone to figure it out himself. My main goal was to get out of high school without a pregnancy, and that was achieved. My current goal is to hit 30 without a pregnancy lol. I\u2019m 25 now. So far I\u2019ve skipped the bipolar but I do have pretty severe depression and anxiety and other stuff. If I do end up getting schizophrenia I\u2019d rather have never had a child in the first place then to just say \u201cfuck it let\u2019s play mental health lottery\u201d and get pregnant on purpose between the age of 25-30. If I get pregnant accidentally I would do my best with what I got though. If I didn\u2019t have this concern I would probably attempt to have a baby with my boyfriend/future husband within a year of being married, whenever we decide to do that.Those postpartum sweats were brutalHats are still given to newborns at hospitals. They're OK to wear as long as they fit properly.I figured as much, after a few months they\u2019re able to wiggle while they sleep and I know babies love taking off hats and socks when they\u2019re awake.\n\nI just know people always say \u201cbabies need a hat on to stay warm\u201d so I wasn\u2019t sure how that also compared to \u201cbabies should have nothing on them while they sleep\u201dBabies don\u2019t sweat? I don\u2019t think I really knew that eitherI dunno but I live in Portugal lol.\n\nAnother one is that we can only dry her clothes outside after she's baptized lol.\n\nAnd she can't go out at night unless she had an angel in a necklace thing (I guess this one might have been a marketing ploy haha)I was talking about when people suggest putting whiskey on a babies gums to help teething..\n\nBut in your case, maybe the baby is making sure the boob belongs to you lol and just wants to see your faceYou still get privacy in the bathroom? Lucky youWhat about the garage?I ended up with my step dad around the same age. My bio father was useless. While my step dad actually cares. He may not be perfect, but at least i know he cares.Face facing the ceiling. They should be completely on their back. No blankets no pillows. You can use a sleepsack to keep them warm.I consider myself a reasonably smart guy, not a genius or anything but i'm well read and i retain information pretty well so i'm often the Trivia Guy in any given group, but I learnt SOOOO much from birthing/parents classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe wife and I were almost not gonna go.  We'd read books, we both had family that had kids before us, the wife had baby sat extensively, we felt pretty comfortable... but there is nothing like being in a room full of first time parents and some of them are asking brilliant questions you'd never even thought of and others are asking things that are so braindead you're amazed but when the midwife explains why they're wrong it's for reasons you've never even considered!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone having a child should take advantage of every resource they can get and in todays internet age I think it's important to remember you can learn much more from people in person.Source?\n\nBaby has slept on it's back from the very first night for us.   That's what was recommended and our whole birthing/parents class was (at least supposedly) all evidence based and focused on best practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***1. Put babies to sleep on their backs***  \n*This is the  safest position for healthy babies. Babies are more likely to die of  SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents if they sleep on their  sides or tummies.*\n\nOnce your baby can roll over (at around 4-6  months), keep putting him to sleep on his back, but let him find his own  sleeping position.\n\n[https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/sleep/sleep-safety/safe-sleeping-tips](https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/sleep/sleep-safety/safe-sleeping-tips)To sleep in?\n\nWhere may I ask?\n\nMust be a difference in thinking then because we were directly told it's a bad idea.Hats are for outside is the advice we got.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd we \"swaddle\" our baby as per instructions which basically means onesie with a singlet underneath if it's cold, then wrapped in a blanket like a burrito, making sure the blanket finishes no higher than the middle of their chest.\n\nThat's plenty of warmth in most situations, but it's been really cold where we live so we occasionally wrap her bottom half in another, thicker blanket.  Again making sure it's secure and wont \"ride up\" over night and get in her face.They do sweat a bit but it doesn\u2019t really work properly for a few weeks/months to actually regulate their body temperature.\n\nThey struggle to cool off and even more to keep themselves warm.Where should I get the mouse from, know anywhere good?Did any of these aunts write a parenting book I could possibly purchase for my perusal?That would be hilarious. (And I eventually realized which post this was. Eventually. I really shouldn't be this sleep deprived... My kid isn't ACTUALLY a baby anymore, he'll be four next week.)Gotta lock it, bro.  And ignore the pounding on the door.I'm really glad. It's a shitty thing when people create babies and don't give AF about them.I had the same feeling.  Grew up as the eldest in a huge family so I had plenty of baby experience.  The biggest thing I learned was infant heimlich/ CPR, which I went on to use on my son 5 month later.  Without that knowledge I have no idea how I would have reacted at that moment.My baby was given a hat at birth in an NHS hospital, but the NHS doesn't recommend them for sleep (they didn't mention this at the time).The pet store sells frozen pinkies for snakes.  Or rent a cat and have them fetch it.I got some near the rabbits lmaoI hear you can use an umbilical cord as bait.",

It's mortifying as everyone stares and asks if you're all right.Today I was talking to my hot coworker and I accidentally spit on her face soOr accidentally drooling mid sentence. How does one even smooth that over nonchalantly?\n\n\"Haha, well, there I go again. Clearly I still need to practice the simple biological functions we expect of children over 5. Pardon me, I suspect my diaper is also full.\"Or in the middle of class when you have hiccups and you yawn and hiccup at the same time and everyone looks at u Ever breathe the wrong way?I did this the other day while on a conference call with my boss.  He gave me the rest of the day off because I was coughing and gagging.  Sure I sounded stupid but I got the rest of the day off.What about slipping a disc trying to suck your own dick?When I eat in public, I'm sometimes a bit paranoid that I'll choke on food/drinks and embarass myself by having to make some rapid movements in such a calm setting, which will surely draw people's attention.\n\nThis causes a moderate, constant fear that, in case I choke, I won't be able to remove the problem in the most effective way because I wouldn't want to embarass myself. Then I may get too self-aware and really struggle with swallowing every bit of food.\n\nAnyone else having that kind of anxiety sometimes?A ghost just came in your mouthI have a random minor gag thing that happens occasionally and makes me create faces where I look like I\u2019m about to throw up. I can be on an empty stomach, it just happens. I wonder if it\u2019s some sort of tic or whatever. I\u2019ll be in the middle of someone talking to me and I make these have to puke faces and they think they\u2019re saying something to me that upset me or got me sick. It\u2019s fun. Women totally love it.\n\nA wet fart doesn't do much for your self-esteem either.Unexpectedly gleeking, too. Most embarrassing shit ever.How about aspirating into your lungs during a surgery while you are under and causing a double lung pneumonia for the third time, after already being in the hospital for 2 months in the MICU and causing you to spend over another month in the hospital while having to get a lawyer to be able to be released so you can die at home? (I lived)\n\n-Edited for completeness and to answer questions-\nFirst, I have many chronic disease which exacerbated my condition, which was precipitated by a botched surgery at the SAME hospital I was in the MICU. Without getting into all the legalese, the hospital did everything in their power to keep me in their facility which is why I had to consult a lawyer to understand my right to go home to \"recover\". In fairness, I already had contacted the lawyer to draw up paperwork to update my advance directive/DNR, but I was given fairly low odds by the multitude of doctors and I really just wanted to go home to be with my family and die. The attorney facilitated my release but it was thwarted by multiple issues, one of which is the aforementioned aspiration during surgery causing me to spend longer in the hospital than anticipated. \n\nMy partial list of conditions include: systemic sclerosis (diffuse), pulmonary fibrosis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Raynaud's... the list is long and distinguished. As a result I have fibrosis and dysmotility of the esophagus and stomach, which is directly related to the reason for the aspiration into my lungs (and 8 years of not eating/TPN/enteral feeding). TPN necessitates a Hickman catheter which HAS to be replaced if it gets infected and is inevitable over the period of time I had such. I had one such routine surgery to replace my Hickman, but the facility neglected to put the safety clips on the dual lumen and when I got up to go to the bathroom at 2 AM half my blood was on the floor and in my bed. I was losing consciousness, went into respiratory arrest, had multiple strokes and was put into a coma for 4 days at THE SAME FACILITY that botched the routine surgery. While under their \"care\" I contracted MRSA 3x, double lung pneumonia 3x, intubated 3x, ventilator, nasal gastric tube and every machine you can imagine. I should also mention I lost use of my entire right side (I'm right handed) so all my communication was attempting to write with my left hand as I was intubated for most of the 3 months. I can't tell you how difficult it was to look into my children's eyes and to only be able to squeeze their hands and shed tears, thinking it would be my last form of communication with them...  I think I hit all the important highlights... \n\nThis was not my first rodeo, though, so don't feel too bad.\n\nAnytime this happens, I always try to get a laugh out of people by doing my best Ricky Bobby impression and saying \u201cI\u2019m chokin on my own spit!\u201d\"It's my first time.\"Yeah, when you realize you\u2019ve screwed up breathing, it\u2019s hard to be very proud. That's just your body sensing that you've grown too confident and reminding you who is in charge... I don't think I've ever done that, actually. I've choked on water before, but not my own saliva.[deleted]Stupid epiglottisBreathing is hard.Humans are so fragileNothing takes me up an notch in confidence knowing that everyone has done this at some point and we all feel equally as stupid. God damnit I hate it when that happens. I don't know, non-pubescent voice cracks are still pretty confidence destroying for adult me.30 fucking years and my stupid body hasn't learnt to deal with its own saliva.\n\nFuck.Unexpected effect of getting older #152:  All your flaps and gaskets wear out and you randomly breathe spit a couple times a week.I'm pretty absent-minded when I eat and drink.\n\nI'll frequently inhale my drink and start coughing. Or tip the cup back too far and spill it on myself.\n\nI'll swallow food without having chewed it much, if at all. I'll sometimes start to choke on food and have to focus hard to keep it from going deeper.The random saliva choke is worse than anything. It makes you look like you have been cryingHumans are so poorly designed, I swear lolReally makes you think about how tenuous life is. I could literally die for no reason other than that nature decided that linking the digestive and respiratory system with nothing but a flimsy flap separating them was a good idea.Or when I'm chewing and bite the inside of my cheek.  From then on I can't not bite the inside of my cheek.I do this way too much, and I wonder if I actually have a problem. I seem to be trying to kill myself via choking on my own saliva.I do this on the regular and I can attest to the fact that accidentally drooling in front of people is worse. I have drooled in front of my coworker recently. Not just a little bit, but a whole long line of drool came out mid conversation. There is no coming back from that.Especially while drinking hot coffee while talking to your manager It was never a big deal for me. Until now...It\u2019s kinda like falling off your bike while stationarydroolin is cute if u hotNot being able to get hard with a hot woman might be worse for some guys.It's one of those things that do 1hp of damageWell, gotta say though that I'd rather choke on my own saliva than someone else's.Choking on my own saliva is my ever day. This is how I'll die.Fuck. This happens to me all the damn time. Some of the most aggressive coughing I've experienced in my life. I was feeling really good, having a jog on the treadmill and stupid smile on my face thinking about someone, then this happened \ud83d\ude12... wait I'm not the only one who does that?Did this at my own grandmothers funeral a few weeks ago. I died that day. Real faxI sat coughing for a good 15 minutes at 930pm at work at our slowest quietest time of the day. Like FML up in this place. No one even bothered to ask if I was okay. ESPECIALLY when someone answers my call... \n\nThem:  hello?\n\nMe:  gag... cough,  cough,  cough... gah!!!!I have dysphagia and this happens all the time. I have never done thisI expected to come in here and find a doctor telling everyone that doing that is a symptom of some horrible disease. I dunno. Being single for 30 years will really bring your confidence down a few notches. I refer to it as \u201cI\u2019m fighting evolution\u201d\n\nBecause survival of the fittest is trying to kill me offHappened to me this afternoon \ud83d\ude22 for a second there I thought I'd never been able to breath again.Literally one drop of saliva just fell into my throat and it's fucking killing me. My eyes are too watery to see through and trying to take a breath sends me into a coughing fit. Someone please send help.George W Bush almost choked to death on a pretzel while watching football alone. This was 3 months after 9/11, after the invasion of Afghanistan but far before the invasion of Iraq. If he croaked, his VP Dick Cheney may not have had the support necessary to go into Iraq because he was always seen as a war hawkReading this nearly made me choke on my own saliva. It was a very weird feeling. I made sure I swallowed lolThis is the type of thing that however embarrassing or inconvenient should be easily shaken off and explained away. As it literally happens to everyone I do this all the time!! \ud83d\ude31Just trying to exist and barely managing to survive is my way of life.God damn this happened to me mid conversation today. Almost passed out.Always when I\u2019m cashing a customer out or have to answer the phone at workOr tripping over nothing I\u2019ve choked on my own saliva while asleep. Had to get up and constantly cough while walking around the house. Then I developed aspiration pneumonia. What a miserable time. Did this yesterday, can positively confirm. Yesterday I was studying at the library and the room was quiet af. Not anymore after I took that one single breath.I questioned my own competence at life when I was sucking on a tic-tac and accidentally swallowed it. Like it was at the front of my mouth and I felt myself starting to swallow it and I couldn't stop it and I don't even know how it got to that point and then the tic tac was just gone. I miss that tic tac.Honestly one of the worst feelings everTruth.  I mean seriously, choking, sputtering, thinking 'is this it, is this how I'll die?  WTF will my obituary say?!?'This is the unusual super power I'd want. Make other people choke on their own spit on command.Or accidentally punching yourself in the eye trying to rub it. That litterally just happened to me.Lol thought it only happened to me.The last time this happened to me it was my 3rd day at my new job and the first time i sat with coworkers during lunch in an attempt to socialize. I ended up trying to hold in the cough/choking and that resulted in a gnarly amount of boogers coming out of my nose and landing on the table. Ya...i havnt eaten lunch with anyone since. You will stop coughing immediately if you simply blow your nose. I don't know why, but it works every time.Yesterday I took a really long nap after a bad day, and then I woke up dehydrated, took one small, careful sip of water, and then proceeded to choke on it for at least 5 minsI read another post about this recently, and i have to ask - choking on your saliva?? Is this an old people joke that i\u2019m too young to understand? (22)Or forgetting to breath..I do it way too often these days. I've had a guest at my job come in complaining about being temporarily barred from seeing her newborn after choking on her own saliva when she was at the hospital. (infant was preemie in nicu) Staff didn't want to take any chances of course, and it was prime flu season. That poor woman lived for the moments she got to hold her baby every day but her body was like nope, time to choke on some spit for no reason That's a good point.That\u2019s just your inner you keepin you in checkI\u2019m confident that I do this on the daily. Wait...how did we even evolve into something the harlem globetrotters?Ah, medical aspiration my old enemy. can confirm, spent weeks focusing on avoiding this in my university classes because it happened frequently (3 times in the span of 6 weeks). Haven't done it since. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nother people do though \\^u\\^ huehuehueh...Then add in stress/exercise induced asthma and you got yourself in a nice pickle. /r/Funny\nIt\u2019s like your own body is trying to kill itself. Like, wtf, after all these years of evolution and developing protective mechanisms to survive?!!! Every time I do this I have to act like I was eating something or have phlegm in my throatI have never experienced this but I have, experienced, tripping over my own foot way too many times. I choked on my own saliva one time where I was eating a mento. Long story short, my grandma administered the heimlich maneuver. Also vaping in-game when already self-conscious and then trying to say something while exhaling and hocking like a dog coughing up a dead rodent Happened to me on Tuesday, in the middle of sex. Was not SmoothWhen that happens it takes 1HP from your healthbar After this thread I don\u2019t feel so alone anymore.I know, I know, I know......Just choking on some random ghost dick \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6And then your eyes tear upI was in the middle of talking with someone when I started choking on my saliva and the guy told me to get away from him if I'm sick.Can relate everyday of my life False. I choke on my own saliva all the time. I also choke on food all the time. The only way it has affected me is that I'm greatly confident in my ability to perform the heimlich maneuver on myselfI always tell myself this is the end this is my death and then I stop coughing and I'm fine always expect the worse people If you find that happens a lot, you might want to mention it to your doctor. It can be a symptom of certain diseases, particularly if the gag reflex is impaired, and especially if you're older.\nI once did this in an exam hall. I was sat at the back so everyone turned around and looked at me because I broke an hour of silence with almost dying. [basically this future painting right?](https://imgur.com/a/RiOc7wP)\n\nHow does that even happen? I went thru a phase last month of exactly this.. it's like my throat would.t cooperate with meThis is the kind of post those autorotic asphixiation people really love. I could literally just be standing in Walmart doing absolutely nothing,and then all of a sudden I\u2019ll just start choking to death on my own saliva. It\u2019s really unfortunate. Disagree. Been living without a uvula about 6 years now, regularly have this exact issue. \n\nFrustrating, annoying, I miss the saliva regulation provided by the uvula, but I've gotten past feeling self conscious about it.\n\nPeople see me and I'm like, no continue talking, don't worry about me, I have to do this myself. As long as they know I'm not dying its all good. Happens when i think about a big juicy steak, medium, with freshly cut fries. Try just dropping off to sleep when you come back to consciousness with a start thinking you've just tripped over something and are falling over even though you're lying down.Right lol. It's like, just sitting on my couch, minding my own business, then I happen to just breath in with a little bit of saliva in my mouth and proceed to cough and choke like i swallowed a bug XDI'm a make-up artist and I ALWAYS end up having a cough attack. It only happens when I talk. It's so damn embarrassing. Then the talent begins to look disgusted and worried because they think I'm sick. Their whole demeanor changes and they stop talking. I have to explain to them that I was choking on my spit and swear that I'm not sick. I don't think any of them believe me.Its actually your dignity. Hahq thats funnyYou know what else does? Asthma. Of all the things it sucks to be bad at, breathings gotta be top of the list.Random cough attack on a bus or.....my fav: accidentally couching up phlegm which flies out of your mouth in search of a new environment.\ud83d\ude0aand you ate something spicy not long before so the burn causes you to choke and cough more than you normally would.  in public.  on the bus.that or drinking water and just choking on it half way through or, my favorite, choking on air.Small tip: If you ever choke on a liquid, and it feels like air is stuck, burp. You'll instantly stop choking. Just a warning, this works mostly if you swallow a drink using the wrong hole.Or randomly drooling when you're concentrating.\nI wonder how my family would react when they would find out. It would be hard to swallow.This happened to me literally 2 hours ago, and I had to gulp water sheepishly, while checking to make sure my roommate hadn\u2019t seen. Isn't this an early symptom of MS or some other condition? It rarely happened to me when I was younger, now at 52 it happens a lot more.  \n\nThe owner of an apartment I used to rent started ended up in the ER because he felt he was choking and they said nothing was wrong.  He ended up in the ER a few more times and he was dead a few years later. omg.It's like your body were trying to assault yourselfThank you for triggering my PTSD.  I just had this experience in a completely packed gondola.  Fifty people, packed like sardines, turning their heads away from me as I tried unsuccessfully to silently recover from a spit-induced coughing fit.  Sorry for the spittle everyone. I once took a sip from a cup of tea, except it wasn\u2019t near my mouth and it instead went all over my lap Especially after you ate spicy food so your choke is hot and spicy as wellAnd that\u2019s when you also fail at the most 2 important things in surviving life... breathing and eating. You need to be kinder to yourself. Just have a chuckle and move on.TIL I'm not alone...This occasionally happens when I sleep. Like I'll sleep and then all of a sudden, saliva would clog my throat and then I'd have to wake up.This happens to me so much.Did this on my first movie date, in a theatre was definitely where I least expected it. Had a 3 minute coughing fit and am scarred with embarrassment.Wat about wen that dry stuff sometimes falls from your nose? This happened to me when I was answering a call from a client I had been trying to reach for days! I almost died choking and coughing and eventually decided I had to transfer the call to a coworker so I could finish coughing in peace. Only I forgot to press transfer, and the client was stuck listening to me cough for several minutes before I realized and actually transferred the call. \n\nMy coworker had no idea why I was trying to reach this particular client, and just hung up before coming to check on me. The client told my coworker she was worried about me, but never called back. Fun timesIt annoys and angers me. It doesn't reduce my confidence.I have a bad habit of saying everything in one breath... quickly suck some air in, suddenly choking on saliva. \nMy life. This happens to me all. the. time. I sometimes miss my mouth while drinking water.Actually I think your confidence is knocked more when you sneeze and a bit of wee comes out.  Happens when you get old. I literally did this less than 30 minutes ago whilst sitting in slow moving traffic. Thought I was going to crash.Ghost dicksIt makes you super aware that you cannot trust anyone, not even your own body.Or random saliva dribbling for no particular reason in the middle of a conversation.My wife is like this but mostly when she sleeps. I don't know how she does it but several times a month she wakes up coughing and choking on her saliva.Truer words have never been spoken before.What about biting the inside of your cheek or your tongue while eating? I have literally been practicing chewing all my life and still bite on my cheek/tongue.I one of the worst is whenyour jonny cant fall asleep but you have to get your ass up in the class and walk to the front..If i lick my gf's (imagine i have one) face, that is arousing/kinky, but if i spit, that is rude???As weird as this might sound, this is so satisfying for me to read. Apparently it keeps happening to me, to the point that even my coworkers notice. Once, a coworker started going  like \"Did you know my grandfather was always choking on everything and that was how he discovered he had esophagus cancer?\". That scared the hell out of me, but I think I'm just clumsy.Happens to me all time. That's probably how I'm gonna die. I just laugh, it's funny as fuck if you ask me. Let them laugh along as wellWow that's a thing? Never happened to me lolI used to work in a bank, and one day I was with one of my managers who was a complete asswipe it was after I had balanced the money and closed,  she was droning on about  performance, branch targets and usual boring bullshit,  next thing you know I choke on what must've appeared to be thin air and started coughing,  which very quickly turned into a full blown panic attack with me spluttering that I'm OK as I'm gasping for air between coughs. After about a minute and a half of barely clinging onto life,  I stopped coughing as suddenly as it had started and heaved a couple breaths, as I looked at my manager who for once actually had a look of feigned concern as she asked \"are you OK,\"  with my face covered in tears, saliva and maybe even some snot, I put on a rock solid poker face and said \"I'm fine\".\n\nThings were a bit awkward for a week or two between the two of us which was good because I usually tried avoiding her like the plague anyway. You\u2019d think after 37 years of practice you\u2019d have it down pat. You\u2019d be wrong. Some day. Hey, you gotta have dreams. Hahahahaha This whole comment thread is very therapeutic. I had a uvulectomy years ago, and this happens to me on the daily. Driving is the worst time. This has happened to me multiple occasions while I'm sleeping. Ugh I hate it when this happens... Happens to me in discord calls with my friends... They're like \"you ok\" and I'm like \"yeah .... No.... Long pause cough cough yeah I'm fine\"\n\nI just don't talk for the next 10 mins or so. Needing an inhaler to breathe on occasion sure doesWe're the dominant species of this planet apparently, but we all fail to swallow sometimes. /r/meirlOnce I choked on my own spit in history class and my teacher gave me a cough drop. I mean. I can\u2019t refuse it...I have achalasia, this happen to while I sleep every other night.  It\u2019s scary as all hell!Whenever I cough my mom's ready to pump me full of medicine, herbal drinks, tea and stuff. Always gotta defend myself and explain that I'm choking on my own spit.\n\nLuckily I rarely choke. Only once a week :/I do this all the time. What the hell is this?Ever had a girl sigh during sex? That one's pretty demoralizingOr when you laugh and nearly choke from air/saliva/phlegm, turns a funny moment intensely serious. This happens randomly the more you age along with stretching too fast and causing a cramp leaving you immobile in withering pain for a few minutes.  when you\u2019re singing and suddenly your throat forces you to swallow. i have stage fright and i almost ran off the stage. \n\ntripping UP stairs. or over nothing. \n\nalso there was this one time i was listening to music and strutting down the hallway like i was performing at a music awards show. then i slipped on a magazine that i forgot i\u2019d left on the ground in the room i danced into (it was nighttime and most of  the lights were off). somehow i didnt actually fall, i just skated three feet, but needless to say, i didnt feel like \u201cperforming\u201d anymore. i was embarrassed despite nobody having seen me, so i righted myself, picked up the darned magazine and walked away try to forget what had just happened. Accidentally shitting yourself also hurt your confidence alzheimer's is no joke...Similarly: \n\n- chomping down on my tongue while eating, then ruining the meal with self-loathing\n\n- taking an extra step when I\u2019ve run out of stairsMy wife did this recently. She starting telling me about her day, etc and all of a sudden it started: a slight raspy voice and then she breathed in, straight into a coughing fit trying to clear it. I calmly tell her \"honey, you can't breathe saliva\" where I was promptly welcomed with a middle finger mid-cough.Tbh walking past a mirror and seeing my reflection ruins my day far more than random choking.I did that yesterday really badly, during an orchestra concert, between pieces, i\u2019m first chair cellist......this is a thing?It literally happened to me while reading this...Can confirm; did this at a client meeting.For those of you who do this a lot, look into GERD. It\u2019s a simple condition with fairly easy (but slow) recovery.\n\nOr if you love your spicy foods, maybe don\u2019t. The treatment plan will make you sad...\n\nI used to choke randomly much more often. It took a few months, but now I just take one pill nightly (omeprazole) and it hardly ever happens anymore.Well you see, when you get hurt, an invisible doctor heals you slowly over time. \nHowever we know this already- the interesting bit is that choking on your saliva is actually just the invisible doctor checking your cough.You ever dunked your hand in burning hot coffee like you were reaching for a pen? Immediate reaction is \"ouch\", but it's a slow burn and leads to \"moron.\"So, it's not just me?This happened right as I was starting to answer a question on the first day of one of my college classesOr just choking because you're breathingI agree, chocking on spit is a regular thing for meChoked on my coffee and had to spit it all back in the cup 30 seconds before I came across this post. Ruined my last cup of coffee. That's just you body telling you, \"don't get cocky. I could kill you at any time.\"You know, I've done this 3 times a day for the past week. It is the most frustrating thing ever. Including when your singing or laughing. Like, Stahp!r/suspiciouslyspecificlmao YUP. happened on my 2nd date with my (still current boyfriend) and i was SO embarassed. This happens to me at least once a week lately. I blame pregnancy hormones and constant reflux for my poor esophageal muscle tone.Or how about injure yourself while sleeping? I\u2019ve had to miss work because of this multiple times.Nothing worse than calling someone, and just as they pick up you choke and launch into a coughing fit, while they're on the other end the line.\n\nI did that to my wife 2 days ago.*Starts salivating manually *Wot?I do this all the time.I've farted and sneezed at the same time during a meditation exercise. This happens to me a lot and I dont know why. And I almost died one time because I couldn't breath.Literally just did this before I read this Thought it was just me. Whew.This happens in my sleep way too often. Wake up dyingMakes me feel like im about ready to go on hospiceHow can this even happen? I've never heard of this. It hurt itself in confusion!I was gonna say nothings as bad as being rejected by someone who thinks you\u2019re hitting on them when you\u2019re not, but yeah that tooElzar \"Bam\"Every once in a while, when I breath in, I somehow make the predator sound and then begin choking for some reason. Naturally it seems to only really happen in public and in spaces where I am likely to be heard. Have you ever tried just being me? \n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude2dClancy and the Rockets fan?Read this as \u201cchoking on your own salvia\u201d and was very confusedHey I can choke on my own saliva while tripping over nothing while walking across the floor. Then I'll cough and pee. I call this \"dysfunctional multitasking\"THIS HAPPENED TO ME THIS MORNING!\n\nLuckily it was between two lessons so I ran out of my classroom and avoided any bigger shame.Nothing? I think there are worse things in life. Just cleared my throat after reading this.. so lowOh god this happens to me more than i want to admit. Didnt think it was this common, hahaI get the 1 random super hiccup that sounds like a pterodactyl is getting run over. *Walks to urinal, fishes for wiener lost in the Vietnamese jungle of unkept pubes I\u2019ve let get out of hand do to lack of use, as I stretch its flaccid, shrunken, emaciated self out to pee...as I look down at the pathetic worm I once was proud of and use to love playing with, I realize just how sad my life has become..as I consider ways to end my life on said fine evening.... turtling my lil pecker back into the folds of my boxers, a tiny jizzim of piss dribbles out, as if to add insult to injury...and I\u2019m reminded of that post sex- dick leakage that I haven\u2019t had in a longggg time......instant sad face*I have never done thisI once went to my doctor for some help with head congestion and while the nurse was taking my vitals I dribbled a half cup of snot out of my nose onto her desk. *gulp*Yeah it's up there with the miscount of stairs making you whole body feel like it's going to die because there wasn't another stepIt\u2019s like your brain saying \u201cthat\u2019s right, I could kill us at any moment...you just keep doing stuff that releases dopamine and we\u2019re gonna get along great...maybe\u201dI hadn't done this in ages then randomly did it TWICE in one day. That was a hard day Wtf?You instantly feel the stupidest person on Earth, and that you failed evolution.Yeah, still waiting for the devs to fix that problem.I'm glad I'm not the only one who does this!! Whenever I've said something about it to people they look at me like I'm crazy. When your having a nice day inside and then open the door TO THE UNGODLY LIGHT OF DAY!\n\nSame kinda thing reallySo paranoid about my kids choking in general. My son nearly do so on a spree last weekend and my god it was horrifying. Although he coughed it up I urge everyone to learn the heimlich and CPR. Especially if you have kids.  this happens to me 2-3 times a month.   I'll be otherwise minding my own business then suddenly have that \"something went down the wrong pipe\" coughing/can't breathe situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nit sucksThere have been more times that I can count that I'll just be minding my own business, and then suddenly everyone thinks I'm dying.I have had this happen on many occasions, one moment you are sitting there fine, and the next, you feel your saliva go down the wrong pipe.  And you are now Choking literally to death, or at least that is what it feels like.\n\nYes in Public this is a Horrible situation, its not much better at home, but the embarrassment factor is HUGE.  People think you are choking on something you just ate 9/10, but you aren't, and you really dont have time to explain this shit at the moment.\n\nThere is really no common denominator for this, it just happens...   However I personally notice that I tend to have the issue more often when I am stressed out, I may not even realize that I'm dealing with stress, but in hindsight often times when this happens to me more times than not, Stress seems to be the modifier.\n\nNow, let me take you on another fun little offset to this...  I am not a medical professional, I can only tell you to the best of my ability what I feel, and how it happens at least this is what I think happens.  \n\nI have no idea why there are moments when a simple bodily function of swallowing your saliva suddenly tries to kill you....  Here is what I do think it could be related to.  A condition called Laryngospasm.\n\nI'll drop a link, if you have had the Choking on my spit thing happen, I encourage you to at least give it a look.  Now with this being said there are degrees of this.  There is the Worst case EVER, and then there are the times you were able to catch it early, and prevent the severe version from happening.  However you do still cough some, but its short in duration and you recover much more quickly than you do in an all out episode.\n\nAs I said I am no medical professional, but I think a small amount of spit, kinda goes down wrong and sometimes triggers your Larynx to go into a spasm which in turn makes you literally not able to breath at all, and the natural reflex to this is to FREAK OUT!  So as you might have guessed when you FREAK OUT, the situation goes from bad to worse.\n\nI have found that if I place my hand, a napkin or anything in front of my mouth when this happens, I close my mouth and try to take tiny small breaths instead of GASPING for air, which is what you naturally want to do because your brain is saying HEY MAN I CANNOT FUCKING BREATH, I NEED SOME AIR AND I NEED IT RIGHT NOW....  Followed by OMG WE ARE DIEING!...\n\nI have had this happen to me for years, but in the past 5 years it seems to be happening more frequently.  As I said sometimes it is directly relative to stress, however not always.\n\nFor those who have dealt with this you probably already know, you go to the Ear Nose and Throat Doctor, or your Primary care doctor, you tell them the story and they look at you like you have lost your damn mind....  They have no answers, their is little to no information about this online.\n\nEXCEPT...  There is this one Doctor who just happen to have the same issue, and he just happened to be an ENT Doctor, and he has a video online and he explains what your feeling, how it happens and what is going on.  I was so glad when I found this guy and his video because I literally felt like I was the only person on the planet that had this issue.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPtdkqOLLP4\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/expert-answers/laryngospasm/faq-20058269Shit, I go into convulsions.  I've done it in the middle of a meeting - just sitting there one minute, and the next minute I look like I'm being electrocuted.\n\nFucking hate that shit.I've had posts get deleted for being shower \"observations\". This definitely seems like one of those. I think this is a good post btw. I just don't understand the inconsistent moderators. Since this presumably occurred to you while in the shower, the only advice I have to give is, don't look up, and; keep your mouth closed. I\u2019ve got something worse, a speck of food flying from your mouth mid conversation. It\u2019s the ULTIMATE confidence destroyer. Tripping over nothing is great for confidence building as wellMy friend just accidentally did this. Triggered a fainting incident, he fell on a table, cut his head and had to go to the hospital... He is getting a helmet for Christmas now. Is this a natural symptom of aging? Because I find myself doing this more and more.I'd have said \"Uur, you spat on me.\" And stare at them with discust.Or when your gum falls out of your mouth while talkingwell, swallowing and other mouth movements are controlled in part by your vagus nerve, which you could think of as the gut brain everyone refers to as trusting their gut (aka confidence) so perhaps a loss in confidence is quite a proper psychological response. maybe I'm high.I don't know about that. It is one of the rare times when my fighting spirit is awaken.Did he spit back?I don't know, I was lucid dreaming last night and still got rejected!\nWhat does that even happen lmao.I once choked on spit while walking up the stairs, that was a wombo combo I wasn't prepared for but determined to make it up.I used to do that a lot \ud83d\ude14Nothing like this has ever happened to me lol, guess I'm boringAnd then your throat burns How about tripping over nothing?Oh, I do hate it when that happens to me! :-(Unless you're sick. Then you just feel like more shit.Couldn't agree less...I'm not the only one who does this?!?! I feel so much better about my stupid self now. Remember: Just because it contains oxygen does NOT mean you can breathe it.This made me, for real, bust out laughing at my desk in the office. Now people be looking at me like I'm crazy...lmfaoI used to work in radio and there's nothing more embarrassing than choking on your own spit while trying to read news or just talk. Its hilarious for listeners.... but not for the ego LOLWas at a soccer game and attempted to drink beer; instead I inhaled it, and coughed it up all over the lucky fan in front of me...\n\nHe was cool about it though, and I ended up buying him a beer to make up for it.Did this happen to you as a child or something im confused. How do you choke on your saliva when you\u2019re not eating? Maybe you have overactive salivary glands Wait how does this happen exactly? I've never choked on my own saliva and I'm having trouble even visualizing how you even could? Or is it like when it goes down your airpipe thingy, just like how you'd choke on a drink?I beg to differ. Accidentally snorting while laughing is way worse.Choking on my own awesomeOh wait until you\u2019re in your 80\u2019s and this happens all day long.  Ugh.I hate that happens al the timeTrue I love it when I get someone\u2019s attention to say something, inhale to start my state...\n\n\\**cough**\n\\**cough**\n\\**cough**\n\\**cough**Yea. The iPhone XMy confidence remains intactI was 30 something the first time my body forgot how to breath.  Tripping on air is a close second likeTry having the saliva and a little bile then go up into the back of your nose while trying to fight off the choking of your own saliva. Happened two nights ago while I was falling asleep. FfsWhat about needing to sneeze and all leads up to it and stops right at climax and all comes out is a weird sound Cough. I. cough. Know. Cough. The. Cough. Feeling.  Cough cough coughMy wife sometimes requires me to blow in her face like a baby because she'll do this, then can't catch her breath. It's embarrassing for everyone involved.I play trumpet, can't tell you how many times a day this happens. Legit thought \"This is it\" a few times.I legit did that this morning getting up from bed and had such a coughing fit that I had to sit back on my bed and ended up falling back asleep for another 6 hours after. I am a failure of a personReminds you that you're never really safe...\n\nKeep your head on a swivel, people. But not too much because your neck's always trying to break itself. Nothing takes down notch except for microsoftI thought it was only me this was happening to. A DAILY occurrence!How is this connected to confidence in any way? Happens all the time. Or do you begin to blush and cuck down every time you fart as well?YOU PPL ARE PUSSY MOTHERFUCKERS\n\nI have something in my throat.  A piece just flew out.  Bloody saliva\nAre you feeling alright, Mr. Dong Wanger?Sorry I was choking on your bullshit, Karen.Yeah, it isn't a problem at home or in other relaxing settings. If you, for instance, choke on food/saliva/drink while sitting, you can violently stand up, or do whatever the hell will solve the problem in the most effective way. In public, you don't have this luxury. You can do the same, but you'll make an ass out of yourself and attract much unneeded attention.\n\nWhat will you choose? Pretend that nothing happened and risk your health or safely remove the peril but cause embarassment? There's always that fear looming over you.I did this a few weeks ago at work. Office was silent, everyone heads down and focussed. All of a sudden I breathe in and start choking to death.\n\n\nAll eyes are on me, CEO walks up like \"dont die please, hiring people is exhausting\". I had to say I forgot how breathing worked for a moment. We all laughed, I died inside, good times.What\u2019s worse is when you\u2019re trying to compose yourself so you don\u2019t make a scene and you start to pass out because you can\u2019t breathe. It\u2019s happened to me in the most inappropriate public settings. I did it once during one of my finals when I was in high school. Dead silent room, I was mortified at the time.\n\nNow it's very low on my list of embarrassing shit that keeps me awake at night, so I got that going for me.Or coughing and then letting a fart slip out. Happened like twice in my life but felt so disgusting at that timeAnd it's not a little cough and you're done. You're suddenly coughing and trying not to die.I\u2019m right there with you buddy. And there\u2019s never a good way to explain what just happened. I used to work in a bank, and one day I was with one of my managers who was a complete asswipe it was after I had balanced the money and closed,  she was droning on about  performance, branch targets and usual boring bullshit,  next thing you know I choke on what must've appeared to be thin air and started coughing,  which very quickly turned into a full blown panic attack with me spluttering that I'm OK as I'm gasping for air between coughs. After about a minute and a half of barely clinging onto life,  I stopped coughing as suddenly as it had started and heaved a couple breaths, as I looked at my manager who for once actually had a look of feigned concern as she asked \"are you OK,\"  with my face covered in tears, saliva and maybe even some snot, I put on a rock solid poker face and said \"I'm fine\".\n\nThings were a bit awkward for a week or two between the two of us which was good because I usually tried avoiding her like the plague anyway. I've done it a few times or while on a the phone with a client, or a doctor (work related) I end up saying something like \"sorry about that I forgot you can breath your own saliva, but you seem smart and are a medical professional and probably knew that\". They chuckle we all move onMaybe she liked itDid she at least say \"Hey, not in public\" and wink?One time I was drinking a beer with a friend, and I don\u2019t know why, but shortly after the first sip I got a sudden urge to cough. I essentially did a sudden spit take out of nowhere, right in their face. \n\nNever happened to me before that, and hasn\u2019t happened since then. I got sat next to a hot older red head on my first day at work and laughed with a bit of excess saliva in my mouth and spat it at her by mistake\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwe've been together for 2 and a half years and are getting married in October so maybe you're on your way ;)Just hope she doesn't get pregnant pal.Now that\u2019s a power move Say it, don't spray itYou silver tongue devil you.Establish dominance zoop \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc49When I was a young lad and got my first job at a bank and wasn\u2019t much of a drinker yet we were all at a bar drinking beers standing in a circle when o tried to take a big gulp and gag reflex kicked in and is spat beer all over my new bosses and colleagues. You gleeked?Did she do the thing where she didn\u2019t say anything but kinda just wiped it off without breaking eye contact so you knew she knew and were just ashamed?Confidence up a notch.this is my fearAsserting dominance, I see ...\u201caccidentally\u201d.  i applaud your passive aggressive attack sir.   Hog the copier everyday will you Karen? i\u2019ll show you !Next time aim for the clothes and follow up with \"let's get you out of those wet clothes\"This is the funniest random comment I\u2019ve seen this week.\"Accidentally\"What if you spat at her face to cool her down since you saw she was so hot?Dont careWhenever i see a hot guy i always jokingly say \u201ci\u2019d let him spit in my mouth\u201d and but i\u2019ve never thought about it actually happening Don't worry, you didn't have a chance with her anywayOh wow, worker of the monthElaborate.Hey man *sees drool fall down* oh um *whipes mouth* um..  Uhh..  Um...  So how was your day man, just ignore thatActually you answered your own question. I don't believe any response can smooth it up more than yours. I'd laugh out loud and gain respect to anyone pulling a similar comeback.I laughed so hard I hate when I do this and dread that anybody sees it.\"Oop, sorry, I just saw something delicious and my mouth came. Doing anything exciting this weekend?\"Ugh, right? I have permanent cotton mouth and sometimes I just drool when I'm speaking to people. I usually stroke my beard and wipe it off at the same time, in a cool sort of  \"Ah, yes, I'm considering what you're saying\" kind of wayI hope this [video](https://youtu.be/n7mHH1mOl7s)  of the president of Portugal drooling mid-convo with Xi Jinping (the president of China) will makes you feel better. i unintentionally spat in my cats face It\u2019s kinda even worse when you drool when playing the guitar. It happens when you\u2019re concentrating so hard.Cue the flashbacks Your hiccup is always at its loudest point when you yawn \n*yaaaaaOOUUHHwwwnn*\nNobody:\n\nMe: BLACHAACKAAAA..... sorry, air went down the wrong hole[deleted]Mute your goddamn phone, Karen. I can't tell you how many times I've done this in an important business meeting. You......\n\n\nNooooo, no.... No.\n\nNothing like that.Can I help you out bro?It is something I attempted once, but it seemed dangerous so I stopped.  Plus, I ended up with the coughing problem mentioned above.Could be worse could've broken your neck and succeeded. Found with your own balls resting on your lipsUsername checks outI was at a work lunch a couple weeks ago, and the guy sitting across from me swallowed something and it went down the wrong tube, and he was coughing, and eventually started puking, and ran to the side room at the restaurant and puked all over the floor. They had to bring a mop to clean up his puke. All while we were eating our lunch. That guy lived your fear and then some. That kind of happens to me but when I\u2019m home alone. I start thinking about what would happen if I started choking. I don\u2019t really have any chairs that I could drop myself on (I\u2019m not tall enough) and one neighbour is a creepy alcoholic and the other works a lot. \n\nSo then I start overthinking it and it just spirals. Yes! And I have tmj so I chew weird, and I have GERD so I already have a couple of eating issues making swallowing harder. It helps to gulp the food down with water or just eat part of it and take the rest to go and eat it later in private. Holy fuck, just remembered i had a problem filling up my mouth too much too quickly as a kid. Which would lead to me chewing endlessly and almost choking at almost every meal. It just never occurred to me that eating slower would fix the problem. I started pacing myself around 11-13 years old after getting dry hiccups and almost choking on pasta. This is actually a huge problem with choking, when it happens people's first instinct is to get up and go to the washroom, not wanting to draw attention. Then once you're in the washroom, you end up passing out from lack of air, with no one knowing you're in trouble. \n\nRemember kids, if a buddy gets up mid sentence and rushes to the washroom, follow them just in case! Yes absolutely... Drinking something with headphones on and trying not to swallow too loud  is impossible if you're aware of it. You just start thinking of how annoyed everyone must be from it and you just sink deeper into the darkness with every sip.My grandfather once choked in a fancy restaurant during a buisness meeting. Since then he overly chews all his food refuses to eats most kinds of meat. He\u2019s been talking to someone so it\u2019s going better, but you can still notice that he\u2019s scared to swallow.yes. with much worse and improbable disasters lurking aheadI used to be paranoid that someone wud choke while we were eating (not myself). I used to be like \u201cplease eat slower, u guys are fragile!!\u201d In my mind lol. Glad im not like that anymoreI want my dollar.I have a friend with a similar issue except he randomly squaks really loudly. He just does it every couple of hours one time at random often at inopportune moments.\n\nDone in cinema, done talking to a girl has he done it a funeral? You better believe he has! I thought I was alone with this condition, mostly it happens first thing in the morning for me. I also always have big rasping burps all the time too. Like disgusting, vibrate the window burpsTf is gleeking?\nIs that when tiny \u2018water\u2019 droplets shoot out of your mouth when you open your mouth and your tongue is positioned in a weird way?\nIf so, I feel your painYeah I have this problem now. Basically every time I yawn I gleek so I always cover my mouth when yawningUgh the worst. Oh yeah hate it when that happens>(I lived)\n\nHoly shit that was a rollercoaster and a half of emotions. Glad you pulled through.Humblebrag mate, we're all alive here.

Finally get control but be plagued by tiny coughs for the rest of the day. > hiring people is exhausting\"\n\nTell me about it.

I really don't want to do that paperwork involved if you die on the clock.\n\n[deleted][deleted]Yep. Your face is turning bright red, your eyes are watering, and everyone is contemplating whether they need to do the heimlich even though you weren't eating anything, asking if you're okay, and you try to tell them it's fine but you can only wheeze Was I the only one who read it ' licked ' Go on...r/underratedcomments Is that wat ur into? She poopsI once experienced a sudden, unexpected, and irrepressible sneeze event while standing with my beer in the pub. I sneezed a huge wad of snot right into my full pint of beer, and there it sat, on top of my beer...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis in no way went unnoticed. It was a Friday night and the pub was heaving, but people still found a way to move back 1M from me in all directions and let out a collective 'Euuuryuuuuuuk' of disgust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd rate it as more embarrassing than when my teenage self jumped off a swing in front of a group of teenage girls, but my shirt remained on the swing.I was once stood next to a table of friends, laughed at a joke that I'd thought of in my head. I full on sprayed the entire table with beer. It was not pretty.I had this with coffee once while having breakfast in school Can't happen again if you have no friends anymoreCongrats, dude.spitting works \\*taking notes\\*Preganant?!?*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** Sadi_Reddit! ^(hug)I feel personally attacked.just commit and pull a Rick, start calling everyone Morty.\n\nwarning: this might make things worse, depending on your audience\"Sorry, I heard a bell ring!

Tuesday.Did you think he was writing his comment from hell or something?I dunno, man. Have you read half the subs?By the look of things there are only 6 of us who have never choked on our own saliva. I'm fairly confused to say the least.I'm wondering the same. Can't remember ever choking on saliva. [deleted]For me it tends to happen if I take a deep breath and some spit runs down the back of my mouth at the same time.  So like if I'm yawning, for example.\n\nThe spit gets sucked in then I spend the next ten minutes coughing like I'm about to die.\n\nMaybe some of us have over productive saliva glands?  I know my kiddo drooled the most of any baby I've ever seen, and it only got worse when he was teething.\n\nIt felt like a major milestone when he learned to swallow his spit instead of drooling.My friend once had it happen to him, and I was like wtf how does that happen? I was maybe...26, 27? Now I'm 31 and it's happened to me a few times now. not sure if getting older actually caused it or if my friend is a vengeful witchyou may suffer from Perfect Life Syndrome! \n\nmany don't even know they have it.Thanks but I think \"pay attention while eating and drinking\" is sold over the counter.And you accuse me why?not quite what that sub\u2019s about my friendr/holupr/suddenlysexoffenderWtfThe internet thinks Karen is a funny name and will blindly upvote anything that has the name in it.r/unexpectedofficeWe know Cheryl!

Some of which contained actual choking \u201cThen\u201d Just make sure they know how to breatheHard to say, there's plenty to pick from. Shitting my pants on the first day of high school ranks pretty high, though I managed to get through that without any of my peers noticing.\n\nI inadvertently sorta defended slavery in a freshman political science class. I was arguing that a politician should always fight for what their constituents want without letting personal beliefs get in the way. Professor brought up slavery, I foolishly dug my heels in because I'm an idiot, and was an even bigger idiot back then.\n\nParticipated in a conversation that wasn't actually happening because I was stupid high and couldn't differentiate my thoughts from my other senses. This was in the middle of a class in high school, with other students that I didn't actually even know because they were a grade or 2 lower than me. Remember the being an idiot part I mentioned earlier? Yeah, don't smoke weed during lunch kids, it's all fun and games until it's not.\n\nLuckily I grew up and learned to keep my head down so my list hasn't expanded much beyond dumb shit I did in high school and my first couple years at college.\n\nBonus round: used internet chat and texting acronyms in real life speech.

I think it's less of a breathing problem and more of a underestimating just how much saliva you have in your mouth at the moment. Well, mention it to your veterinarian, then?

    "Comments": "Wikipedia has pretty remarkably strict rules for NPOV style and sourcing, and the other editors are pretty ruthless about enforcing them on anyone who tries to alter articles to fit a personal narrative.Some for WikiHow pictures. Like, who makes those?Most objective, academic-style writing sounds the same. That's kinda the point.Steven Pruitt did most of itImagine every Wikipedia article having wildly different tones. \n\nSnow: Snow is a collection of snowflakes that are created when the water in cumulous clouds freezes in a crystalline pattern bla bla bla...\n\nHitler: yooooo lemme tell you bout this dude Hitleeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr! This mothafucka killed, like MILLIONS of Jews, and that shit is wack.The most viewed ones certainly do but if you start diving into more niche topics you'll notice the quality can be all over the place since they aren't as moderatedI remember reading that some guy with almost nothing else to do edited a massive amount of Wikipedia himself.You'd be surprised how it looks on the backend. They literally have \"trials\" over stuff like that.Well yes it IS meant to be non-biased factual information derived from primary sourcesSyntax wise, it is very interesting. Syntax in general is a CRAZY complex subject but very cool. It's mostly because people consciously or not try to mimic language around them so they mimic the same syntax found in wikipedia.So does reddit.I once edited a page concerning the area I live. The street that I LIVE ON kept getting deleted as a \"former\" street.\n\nThey reverted the page 4 or 5 times before I finally snapped on the talk page and told them I live on the damn street, and even Google has it mapped.\n\nThe people running that site absolutely have their biases, and I lost confidence since that issue. It may be a decent site to kickstart your research, but don't take it as gospel.Wikipedia has strict rules and those who don't follow them are either reprimanded or removed from articles. Every major page has its own team of basically power-tripping editors that revert pretty much everything that isn't something as simple as changing someone's pronouns after they come out as trans. I'm not deriding trans people, just using that as an example. Wikipedia, like any major internet community, has tons of drama most people don't see or care about. If you try to edit a page that means anything to anyone you're going to probably hit a wall that ends up pissing you off.Don't a small number of neckbeards moderate literally thousands of wikis? Or am I thinking of Reddit moderators?I've seen a few articles where they state something that is blatantly a contributors opinion and it sticks out like a sore thumb[removed][removed]I find pages concerning anything politically controversial often look like they were written by a pundit. Those articles are usually puppy guarded by people who are definitely not open to any discussion about what facts are allowed to be posted.Good old NPOV, neutral point of view!It\u2019s like choirs - get enough people singing at once and they all sound the same.Try reading articles about Hindu mythology1/3rd of all wiki articles are made by one guy. He does it as a hobby.And that\u2019s why I count every $ I donate to them as important as the ones towards my kids\u2019 tuition.Except for articles on US politics or political figures.  The bias is insane.Probably something like regression to the mean in statistics; the more people contribute to writing something, the more it'll read like an average academic paper.If you want the internet  to sound like Snoop Dogg, check out [Gizoogle](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). It does it with Google, Wikipedia, and many popular sites as long as you search it through Gizoogle.Actually was part of a project to help create an article in college. Imagine 250 really bright college people divided into groups of 6 to create new articles. It was awesome and seeing edits today on the page since we created it is something surreal.They have well defined guidelines and there are also people who can help you write and source to better conform with there style guide. \nI did an assignment in one of my college courses where we had to add info to a Wikipedia article.I've seen a few little sentences here and there on Wikipedia that make me think twice.Try editing something on wikipedia and you'll find out why.  The moderators are very active to the point where even correcting wrong information is impossible unless your are one of them.  The notion that wikipedia is some massive crowd sourced repository of information is false.I often come across poorly written articles on various subjects that just haven't been updated to fit standards. You can put a template on it to request it to be updated but there are loads of articles to fix and they just kind of slip under the radar. Most recently and memorably \u2018History of Indonesia\u2019 is poorly written. There's one on a particular beach in Bali that is surprisingly more detailed and better than that, but a lot of it is tourist brochure rubbish that doesn't belong in an encyclopaedia.Of Wikipedia\u2019s 26 million registered users, roughly 125,000 (less that 0.5%) are \u201cactive\u201d editors. Of these 125,000, only some 12,000 have made more than 50 edits over the past six month. And of these selfless few, one man is king of the domain.Justin Knapp and Steve Pruitt account for the majority of all the edits on Wikipedia. If the writing is consistent it\u2019s because there\u2019s only 2 people doing all the writing.There\u2019s one guy that\u2019s written 35,000 articles and made over 3M edits on WikipediaSo does RedditIt's pretty heavily censored, so if you write outside of a specific format, you get redacted almost immediately.  Not like China, obviously, but just...mainstream thought rides.\n\nYou can see this in a lot of edit sections on articles, there are only one of a few approved users to many, many articles.\n\nSo people can edit, but it won't stay editedThats because one guy has done like 30% of everything lolFuck wiki editors. I made several major contributions to the history of buildings I worked in London (U.K.) based on internal documents which added a lot of history - to see it all deleted because some wanker decided it \u2018lacked provenance\u2019 DESPITE my quoting sources. Way too many basement dwellers wishing to rewrite history to suit their agendaI know. It's because it's all in the same font.We are BorgWikipedia has a surprising strict manual of style that the administrators enforce, as a Wikipedia editor myself, the admins are actually really impressive.... its called professional and objective?And then there are the ones who vandalize anything that isn't locked.I've had the exact same thought yesterdayIt is revised, so... yeahBecause mods get on your ass if you write with a subjective tone.One of the things you're taught if you ever tread the bitter path of academia is... ***rhetoric***... \\*shudder\\*I mean to be fair, a lot of Wikipedia articles are written by one guy. Steven Pruitt, who as of 2017 has 4 million edits and has written 35,000 articles on Wikipedia.I agree and it thus irritates me that people say there's no way to accomplish this in news. I'd consume the shit out of news that was presented like a wikipedia article\n\n::Edit:: I'd pay for it tooThere's usually someone to reject, correct or modify contributions within hours, if not minutes. Many pages are also \"locked\" to most people.It's mostly edited by the same guy. That could definitely be a large contributing factor. Sorry did I say guy....? I meant legend.I definitely notice the writing on more obscure pages. There's a lot more opinion sprinkled in, whether the writer is aware of it or not.You could say the same for RedditSo does Reddit. Most posts sound like the same person wrote them.Same with the BibleSo do a lot of Reddit comments.First of all, that\u2019s by design. The rules sort of dictate that. If you write an article in the wrong tone, it\u2019s likely to get flagged and re-written. They literally tone-police there.\n\nSecond of all, a very small number of people contribute most of the content. It\u2019s easy for such a small group to stay consistent.They have moderators and editors. You can\u2019t just put some random stuff on it and think it\u2019ll stick.If only news was that way.That's an awesome thought :) \nEven if we consider that sometimes people write (in funny matter) true story that's unpopular and unprofessional. And even things get rewritten, and some contributors are blocked because they wrote facts that someone else did not appreciated.. \ud83e\udd2d life is real1/3 of Wikipedia is curated by 1 guy.Isn\u2019t all pretty much that one guy that got made fun of for how much he contributes to Wikipedia but is really a true hero?\n\n\nSteven Pruitt is his name.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt\n\nOver four million edits and 35,000 articles by one person!\n\nThank you Steven Pruitt!!\n\n\nI checked how many total articles there are on Wikipedia. My god. It\u2019s over 55 Million.\n\nSteven you are still a hero.I mean so does Reddit's. Human minds are sometimes observed to be running in channels of astonishing similarity and inexplicable agreement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The fact of the cosmic mind explains the kinship of various types of human and superhuman minds. Not only are kindred spirits attracted to each other, but kindred minds are also very fraternal and inclined towards co-operation the one with the other. **Human minds are sometimes observed to be running in channels of astonishing similarity and inexplicable agreement.**  \n>  \n>There exists in all personality associations of the cosmic mind a quality which might be denominated the \u201creality response.\u201d It is this universal cosmic endowment of will creatures which saves them from becoming helpless victims of the implied a priori assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion. This reality sensitivity of the cosmic mind responds to certain phases of reality just as energy-material responds to gravity. It would be still more correct to say that these supermaterial realities so respond to the mind of the cosmos.   \n>  \n>urantia bookI had a project for a Ancient History class once where I had to write a Wikipedia article and actually post it to the site. I pretty much wrote it by just using an existing article on a similar subject as a model. That might be one reason why.I believe Wikipedia has a similar distribution of writers as there is wealth in the US.The COO of Wikipedia came to my school and talked about this in depth. Basically, anyone is allowed to add to it but Wikipedia does have people employed that check over everything to make edits, fact check, etc.That\u2019s by design https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style Wikipedia has no hard rules, only cultural norms Wikipedia has saved me through undergrad \ud83d\udc95 bless that siteIt's mostly one person I heard.Well the goal is to be concise and objective as possibleI feel the same way about how all thrift store price tags have the same hand writing.I always think about this. It\u2019s almost like a hive mind.Doesn\u2019t one guy like do 80% of the modifications~~Submit to the hive.~~ idkInb4 he realises just how few people contribute to wikipediaWikipedia's established consistency gives me a lot of hope for our future of responsible self-governanceI don't think that's directly because of the Manual of Style, which I doubt most editors have read in its entirety\u2014rather, it's probably mainly due to learning by imitation.\n\n^(...or this may be just projection on my part.)Huge mega corps also police the shit outta wikipedia. They have goons on their payroll that can edit wiki due to their high standings in the community and have basically zero pushback.\n\nIf anything they don't like gets on wiki they just have it changed.\n\nThis is for reference but there is much larger operations done on this [link](https://www.ibtimes.com/wikipedia-paid-edits-companies-pay-top-dollar-firms-willing-fix-their-entries-1449172)Indeed. It's standardisation/standardization. Heh.Actually, you\u2019d be surprised how many people contribute to it. 1/3 of Wikipedia\u2019s pages are written by the same guy. And yes, he looks exactly how you\u2019d expect \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_PruittIt\u2019s on another level of reporting\n\nIt\u2019s WokeipediaI guess Wikipedia's hive-mind is consistentSame with Reddit though \ud83e\udd14Wikipedia has been expertly moderated for years. I always chuckled when HS teachers would flip out and yell wiki was horrible because anybody can edit it. I remember once a teacher said she edited a wiki page and that meant the site was bad, but then admitted that the page reverted like 2 min later.Literally one guy wrote like 80% of itIf you mean the articles explaining mathematical concepts that make you feel excruciatingly inadequate, then yes, you are correct.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meet-the-man-behind-a-third-of-whats-on-wikipedia/Alex Jones would say it\u2019s the satanic globalists way of seizing control of your minds and making you vote for universal healthcare and also white genocide.  Alex Jones is a fucking idiot.u/chaintip testingSame as Reddit**As a senior editor at Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation), I may be able to answer your question.**[deleted]It's... It's almost as if the articles... are... ***edited. . .***r/ignorantthoughtsThey also need your donations if possible!\n\nEdit: cheap people80% inaccurate tooThat's because all the articles are written by one guy (Steven Pruitt). Quantity over Quality.Consistently biased, yes.Wikipedia is an edited site and is the modern day version of a cross between Chinese whispers and pass the parcel. The last place you would be looking for considered facts.Kind of like how crowds tend to sound good singing a songStill too much \u2018however after a comma\u2019 for my liking. I\u2019m constantly repulsed by shit grammar on that fucking site.That's called... educationFair enough, but have you seen the Scottish wiki?The difference is between pages in relation to countries, especially when its about political or social issues.It's all AI-generated.Reversion to The Mean over time ...The more challenged something is, the more concrete the information needs to be, not open to opinion or interpretation.I remember when Wikipedia was the wild west of information.  Now apparently it's the \"go to\" shits crazy yo.This looks like an album coverWell, they try. They've probably got guidelines and rules for how to write.Didn\u2019t one guy write like 70% of Wikipedia?\n\nEdit: 33%\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pruitt)Read the wiki page for \"human\"\n\nIt's surreal as fuck.But the important question is can you use it as a legitimate source for stuff?Try to contribute something you'll find out why.He aightIntelligence has its own language.ScpWhen you hit the edit button, the Wiki god possesses you and makes you write only as they chooseactually hasn't one man written like 40% of all articles?Ever wonder where wind came from?Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.Wikipedia has a major issue with  power users who stake claim over articles they're interested in.I like to think that most wikipedia articles are written by late highschool and college level people who enjoy writing about stuff. A specific demographic that I would expect to have pretty consistent and in common writing styles and vernacular.Have you ever seen Mr. Wiki and Q in the same room?As does Reddit.Every thing I ever tried to contribute gets taken down so i stopped bothering.You think that right up until you find a write up of any fictional work from the past 20 years, at which point it becomes a million autistic monkeys having a million pedantic arguments amongst themselves. It still works and it still ultimately gets the point across, but the quality suffers a bit.Coz there's this group of people called Wikipedia Editorsa Third of the website is Written by one person.I anticipated more caustic sarcasm.Yet they STILL say in school it\u2019s not a dependable resource!They have a very high standard of code of conduct for editors and contributors.I just learned about XWiki and all the cool shit you can do in there. Hilarious that people go edit it on their own time.Wait until you see Uncyclopedia\u2019s writing stylethat's because it's actually written by a league of evil compromised agentsWell, a lot of it is the same person writing it, or at least wirting the outline that others fill in. Easy to end up in a single style. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meet-the-man-behind-a-third-of-whats-on-wikipedia/It\u2019s mostly one guyDitto RedditJust like reddit.I'm constantly amazed how well-written and organized Wikipedia is considering how many people contribute to it.[The way someone vandalized this article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fat_feminism&oldid=774854951)It's the same reason SCP articles are so similar. Strict writing guidelines./r/conspiracySame with scp. It\u2019s kind of weirdWhat's more impressive is that the writing is generally very informative without being too denseI find this to be true with english wikipedia but not spanish wikipedia.I guess everyone who writes on Wikipedia also probably reads a lot of wikipediaThat's the tone of propaganda.Law of averages.It's strangely objective until it isn't. It always feel so strange finding something where you can tell the writer's view on the subject matterI sometimes read things in my head with Wikipedia toneThat\u2019s an astute observationFacts are facts.One dude contributed life 70% of everything on there, that might contribute.This writing is good.There are mods who maintain a basic standard across all the articles so a lot of it ends up being edited if not written by the same peopleProbably similar phenomenon to how every airplane pilot sounds like chuck yeager on the radio; even folks who\u2019s first language isn\u2019t English.Just like the Borg collective.It's like when you get 100 people singing together and no matter what combination you use, it always sounds the sameSo does \nRedditWikipedia is kind of how people imagined democracy going, all people contributing and a beautiful thing ending up... WelpWell one person is doing a lot of the editing\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/meet-the-most-prolific-contributor-to-the-english-version-of-wikipedia/2018/10/02/a6497a74-9411-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html?outputType=ampThere\u2019s some tone issues I see in some pages vs other, but remarkably similar in tone throughout.  I\u2019ve noticed a few pages had future tones towards past events, what I meant above, but most everything feels like past tense omnipotent type POVWikipedia has turned into a nightmare bureaucracy that basically allows nobody but those high in their internal hierarchy to make contributions that last anything longer than a few hours.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to add to it based on factual knowledge that I was personally involved in about multimedia history, all the edits were erased. \u201cFirst person\u201d history does not appear, because of the way it is structured. Even if you cite other sources, they have very high bar.\n\nIt turns it from a living document, into a distillation of the most repeated and written lies.I like to thing its the same dude writing or editingThis sub is so hit or miss sometimes. Mostly missIf you mix a lot of colours, you consistently get brown. Sprinkle in some policies and guidelines and you have the Wikipedia Brown.Should this include the long-time editor who quietly replaced thousands of references to breasts with terms like \"titties\"?\u201cThems the rules \u2018round here.\u201d Wiki contributorsCrowd sourced tone. Cool.Well isnt that sort of the point?Just look at the power of Reddit to create conformity.... so does Redditexcept those monsters who add something without sources. that i can definitely tellI thought this about Reddit (generally) when I first joined, too. With the occasional exception, a lot of people on here write with very consistent storytelling tone.Most \"opinionated\" content is well moderated... Not really the forum for itI remember starting a Wikipedia page for my dad with my cousin (my dad is a lecturer and has 4 published books in his subject area plus many more articles, papers, etc hence we thought a Wikipedia page was something worth writing) and someone edited our page and changed his date of birth to about 10 years earlier than his actual date of birth. My dad was naturally fairly offended haha.Say no to being on fire!Not surprising at all, they are dealing with facts, and facts have no \"tone\". Believe it or not, the evening news used to sound just. like. that.You be surprised there are a few power users who keep it in check.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_KnappI actually donate to Wikipedia a couple times throughout the year. Great place to learn about anything and not a bunch of opinion thrown in there.The english articles are pretty good. But articles in my native language, especially on niche topics, often written poorly.\n\nLike one people wrote it but not many else checked about the article because the topics isn't that popular.\n\nWhat annoying is when it is about local topic and that is one of only few sources I can find. And no english sources I could find.EwIsn't like 90% of wikipedia written by one guy?I think it's like reading an encyclopaedia (I mean, wiki*pedia*), which has an almost neutral (somewhat bland but engaging) structure/narrative that it shouldn't offend anyone in particular. It just makes for a good medium to immerse yourself in and continue jumping down the rabbit hole(s).Illuminati confirmedThis is not an original thought, seen it on the internet several timesWe try.\n\nIt's very difficult, especially for the more obscure articles.\n\nThe more well-trodden articles have a ton of editors go over them and try to make them neutral, except for a few which have some interest groups camping them out.That\u2019s the sign of a consistent editor.This is the same phenomenon behind scp entries. Standards people. Standards.Reddit has a pretty consistent tone too. Or maybe that's just because I read all the posts the same way in my head lol.Try making an edit that's outside that tone. I dare you. \n\nWikipedia has die hard editors that fiercely protect it.Mustafa is killing it everywhereWikipedia is a treasureThe flavors get edited outThe real hero\u2019s are the fuckers who run shit like the Marvel or DC wiki considering how many different variations of characters and shit are out there now lmaoDont they have a sort of management team?I mean, also consider there are key community contributors who utterly dominate certain topics and will use their privalages to revert any changes made to ensure only their writing remainsI never actually considered this but you\u2019re right! Occasionally you\u2019ll stumble upon an article that isn\u2019t and it\u2019s Jarring.Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.Invisible botsYeah, it's super odd when you find a clearly out of place one. For example [trumps wall wiki page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_wall) is full of sly jabs towards trump and his policies, just read the intro for some examples.Except for the eternal battle between Lions and TigersIt\u2019s like how a whole stadium can sing in harmony but hardly any of us can sing by ourselves in pitch.That\u2019s because of its vast number of policies enforced by editors, administrators, and bots.I suppose they have pretty specific and strict standards and guidelines for writing tone when it comes to wikipedia. Kind of like how SCP articles are always written in a clinical tone thanks to the site's standards.Reddit used to. There\u2019s time for Wiki.It's called a hive mindAgreedA friend with weed is a friend indeed!Best evidence for a simulation so far.That and some write thousands of articles and delete anyone else that dares contributesThey require neutralityI always read it in like a Ben Stein voice when I\u2019m on that site.Maybe there's just one guy who goes around and wikipedia-izes everything to make it congruentman. i dont know how they do it but those wikipedia editors must be dedicated as hellNerds all sound alike to me too.I was thinking this the other day LOLThe Hive MindWhen something seems too good (or too accurate, or too consistent) to be true, it probably is.Isn't like 90% of the stuff on Wikipedia written by about a dozen people? I thought I read or heard that somewhere once but my Google searches are coming up empty.how do i edit this post?It\u2019s kind of like KidzBop where you put enough voices in so it just eventually meshesThe only subject I\u2019m expert enough in to make edits is the rock band weezer. I know. Sad.Cause the verified truth only sounds one way.  Keep that in mind when trying to sniff out bullshit :PI wish Charlie Murphy wrote some pages.Not really. I'm sure the CIA and the corporate \"thinktanks\" that compose Wikipedia have general formatting standards.Somtimes articles in my own language (Dutch) do feel like they\u2019ve been written by a hobbyist or someone who really doesn\u2019t know how to construct sentencesAnd so does Reddit. My friend.Reddit also has a consistent tone[deleted]wikipedia is heavily edited my a small group of users.Oh, I've seen plenty of obscure Wiki articles with a somewhat informal tone.It\u2019s a hive mindThere are studies on phenomena like thisIt's really obvious and off-putting when you read one of the more 'amateur' articles.Well they have a standard and reject everything that is not up to that standardSometimes an article is written differently and it feels very very weird (usually there are not neutral)The way Wikipedia works is much more complicated than \"Anyone can edit it.\"It's wiki astonishingReminds me of scp, where they actively enforce a consistent tone.Same on RedditMeet the man behind a third of what's on Wikipedia\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/meet-the-man-behind-a-third-of-whats-on-wikipedia/Wtf, showerthoughts is still a sub? Who knew?Partly its just factual information unencumbered by manipulative emoting. Much of what we encounter these days are hyperbolic opinions masquerading as facts.I think it's precisely because so many people contribute that it has that tone. Any inconsistencies, tonal breaks, and biases are quickly corrected. You can see the difference if you go to a wiki for something specific, fandom wikis and stuff like that, you'll find that there are many tonal changes that are never corrected.Style guidelines, baby! Every technical writer knows this well.How are Wikipedia pages created?I've often wondered about that myself.TruBecause they all share the same bubble politically and philosophically.Yup, I made a small correction to an article once and it got almost immediately undone. I know for a fact the change was correct, and it was simple, but I didn't care enough to engage. Annoyed me at the time but I figure editing Wikipedia is just not for me. Haven't bothered since even when I saw something that could be improved or fixed (tbf that isn't exactly common for me).\n\nNow if you wanted to edit the Scots Wikipedia, that is another story altogether. That was one of the most epic shit shows on the internet of the last 5 or 10 years (and that is saying something)This here is the right answer. If you want to read entries with personality, head over to the talk pages and you can see just how much discussion and debate goes on behind the scenes.And yet a lot of my teachers in high school wouldn't allow them as a source because of the edit feature, which is why I would just find the sources cited in the Wikipeida page and use those lol. I was like don't you know how strict internet encyclopedia fact checkers are?They are very strict and a very close community, but also very helpful. In high-school I had an AP bio class with an interesting teacher. Instead of finals or regular papers we had a single term long paper. Write a biological Wikipedia article. You got to pick the topic and the only thing that mattered was that you had to start from a stump. This is an article one paragraph or less. It was a pretty daunting project because the goal was to get a GA or FA article. \n\nA GA is a good article. This is an article that has been peer reviewed and found to be correct and lacking technical errors or misinformation. 36,000 of the 6.9 million english Wikipedia articles are GA and an FA is very rare, only 7,000 of those so far. An FA is an outstanding GA that has been specially featured.  I believe in the 7 years this class was doing this project and over 500 articles there was one FA and generally a couple GA articles. In my class of 21 there were three GA Articles written in 10 months. \n\nThis project was only remotely possible due to the assistance of volunteer editors that spent a lot of time helping us dumb high schoolers out.  There were two editors that helped me often with my page and went so far as to be two of the reviewers for the GA status. It really was an amazing project and I would do it again in any class I taught if applicable.  Oh, also if you got a GA then you got an automatic A on the project. If you got an FA you got an automatic A in the class. \n\nSo, if you are ever looking up the Boletus Bicolor Bicolore mushroom on Wikipedia. I wrote that as a stupid high schooler.Have you ever read articles on US political figures. It is beyond biased.The difference between spanish and english wikipedia in subjects about argentina politics is awful. In the english version its neutral but in the spanish version has an incredible political bias to make anyrhing about \"Peronismo/Kirchnerismo\" to be like the best thing Argentina ever got. Just look at \"Juan Domingo Peron\" and its crystal clear[deleted]The title of this one doesn't feel very neutral:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon\\_boy\\_hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_boy_hoax)The downside is that articles that deserve a more human tone and emotional response are muted.\n\nYou get many horrific acts, events and terms becomming muted and being categorized into completley different buckets. \n\nTom Scott had a video on [what is the best thing?](https://youtu.be/ALy6e7GbDRQ)\nWhere he mentioned having to hand sort the last 8000 entries of his wiki browsing algorithm since some disturbing acts were listed under \"rituals\" .. many innocent terms and categories had references to nazis,  eugenics being referred to as \"social philosophy \"[removed]It's stock images traced over by a bot. IIRC you submit a stock image, the bot does its work, you chuck it into an article.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: So a lot of people are saying it isn't a bot, but artists who trace the images.I know, right!? It's always the same thing.. I imagine there is probably a generator with pre-existing snippits to put in your picture or something... but where on earth do they come from, even if it is how I imagine it to be?WikiHow is a garbage for-profit site and should absolutely not be confused with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation.  *Do not* submit your own content to it.  90% of the existing content is terrible.  They're all about quantity over quality in order to sell adverts.  I recommend avoiding it as much as possible.It does until it doesn't, and then you notice.It's all controlled by a hive-mind[citation needed]Wikipedia is fortunately way more readable though. \n\nMany academic works are written in a simply awful style that uses needlessly high-brow language with complex grammar for no other reason than that it \"feels academic\", even though simpler phrasing could communicate the same thing better.I was about to say it\u2019s more like it tries to get as close to no tone as possibleWikipedia is anything but objective.precisely, what a moronic postThe God Emperor of WikipediaThat meme backing him up after someone trashed him has almost made him into a household name.I honestly think he should be nominated for the times person of the year awardPruitt has made a lot of edits, but it's misleading to claim he did even a significant fraction of it- a lot of people do a lot of work to make it. He has started 35k articles out of over 6 million, so more like 0.5%, and most are bulk created by scripts from databases. Wikipedia is just too large for any one person to be responsible for most of it.Over 3 million contributions\nEdit: 4 millionI couldn\u2019t recall his name, excellent contribution to society.I respect the guy and he's done good work, but this isn't true. A majority of his edits are semi-automated and for very minor things such as fixing typos. Not saying his edits aren't valuable, but giving him credit for Wikipedia ignores the work of countless others.The Hitler example sounds like it's been GizoogledThats about the same difference in tone between PBS and FOX \"news\".I used to live on Uncyclopedia, which used to be funny when I was in high school 15 years ago.I'm always impressed how recently edited even the most random things are. Every time I care to check it's like \"edited 2 days ago\"Yeah, sometimes I start reading an article and since I am expecting a certain tone it takes me a couple paragraphs to realise something is off. Then you start noticing a bunch of stuff is wrong or doesn't make sense.\n\nThe worst is when you think something is wrong but are uncertain and when you find another web page talking about it, the piece that is wrong is often just copied. So you don't know if it is actually right or if 1 source is just copying another and you aren't sure which came first because nothing is sourced correctly.A good example of this is the article on the [transformers toy line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(toy_line\\)) which is blatantly just one guy listing his personal beefs.Sometimes you find copy/paste shit on there, and not always plagiarism. I worked with a lot of obscure indie bands in the mid-late 2ks, and distinctly remember the writing style and word choice of a lot of their press releases. In the last few years I've looked a few up on wikipedia to see if they did anything else since I lost contact with them, and in more than a few cases the article was a frankensteins monster of those very 15 year old press releases. Like the sort of blurb that someone would now use as their spotify bio.wow sounds like me when i have 8 projects and 3 tests due tomorrowSteven Pruitt?[removed]I mean a massive number of articles but a tiny drop in the ocean of articles Wikipedia has.That\u2019s what I like to hear about an open source knowledge base.Wikipedia actually generally prefers to use secondary sources rather than primary sources. So like a review article on Medical Intervention X would be preferable to an editor instead finding a bunch of primary sources on Medical Intervention X and essentially writing their own review.Officially maybe. But it has never been non-biased or that factual. Just browse any number of political or historical articles.Eh, I kinda disagree. I think it greatly varies by subreddit. E.g., r/AskHistorians has a very different tone than r/CFBEvery account on reddit is a bot except you.Maybe if you only go to subs that all sound the same. You have to get out and explore a bit, you know? Every nowandthen you\u2019ll find a sub with a nice new sound and you\u2019ll say to yourself feck, where has this lovely community been all my life?\n\nThen you\u2019ll sit there, transfixed by Reddit, still on the toilet like we all are, and wonder where *HAS* it been? You\u2019ve been here long enough, how could it not have more traction, a little get up and go? You know? Some of these things have legs, like yours, now partly asleep from leaning forward and reading Reddit on the crapper, and some just float there, waiting to be discovered, like a possum in a septic tank.\n\nBut lo and behold here you were scrolling through the comments and bam! Like a spice weasel wandering the Venusian wastes, you find a link, a little ole r-forward-slash nonsense. Your curiosity piqued, your respite from life not quite sated by the usual Reddit drollery. And so you click on.\n\nAnd a new sub is found, and so into the rabbit hole you go. Scrolling through the new posts, the hot posts, and the top of all time. From the bottom of the references to to the tops of the community page, you see all there is to see. Until finally, begrudgingly, you decide it\u2019s time to go. You pack your phone away, shake your legs awake, reach over and find, the role of toilet paper is no more./u/PetrosianBot\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd19\ud83e\udd19\ud83d\udd7a\ud83e\udd18 \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0458 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430>\u201dI live on the damn street\u201d\n\nSorry, no original research.I understand the motivations for many of the policies but moderators everywhere have a long history of assholery.This stuff can happen. But every time I hear this kinda of anecdotes, part of me wants to say, really? Is there anything you\u2019re leaving out?  Four or five reversions before you went to the talk page for example?  It feels like the same kind of exaggeration that people put in to any story where they feel wrong. The way that the DMV goes from 10 minutes to 45 minutes in the story, the form they filled out incorrectly was obviously correctly filled out, etc. And we all go along because we are social humans and we like to agree and talk shit about the people who aren\u2019t there, in this case the other editors of the page who kept doing the reversions.  \n\nIt just bugs me when that gets extrapolated to things like, these people have biases. How did your story even demonstrate a bias in the first place?  Did they hate your street?  \n\nSometimes there\u2019s somebody who is a dick. Sometimes people make changes that they think they\u2019re doing correctly and they do it wrong. Sometimes people exaggerate because the story sounds better. \n\nAll I know is, Wikipedia is like a modern freaking miracle that\u2019s one of the things the Internet promised us it would be: information at our fingertips.   And the process generally works.  Part of that process is trying to have a couple anal retentive people guard against sloppiness and vandalism, and I\u2019m willing to jump that hurdle when I want to make an edit because I like to keep the sloppiness and vandalism to a minimum.I mean if you didn't properly cite your sources then they were correct to remove it. If you did properly cite a source then I doubt you're telling the whole truth.\n\nSome random wikipedia editor is not a good source of information, so saying \"but I live there\" is kinda redundant.Sounds like the set up for an r/nosleep story.>I once edited a page concerning the area I live. The street that I LIVE ON kept getting deleted as a \"former\" street.\n\nHmmm, there's no rule against articles on \"former\" streets. I've written several articles on them.\n\nWhat is the name of the street in question?i need to know the context of the need to make edits regarding your street pleaseDefinitely. Circa 2008 whoever was making all the articles must have been very much like me. I always found that when I was reading about someone or something I didnt like, if I scrolled to the \"Controversy\" section, I would agree with it. It lulled me into believing I had such a great grasp on right and wrong in this world. But really Wikipedia is full of bias. Especially when it comes to what some articles choose to omit.This, I can always tell when a PR company or the person themself has written a wiki article on a celeb or someone else notable. They have a policy against it but it rarely gets enforced.I'm a frequent Wiki editor. Any pages specifically you'd like to point out so we can go and fix them?\n\nOtherwise, as it goes on Wikipedia, this claim is [citation needed].Make about 10 to 20 random edits and you can make as many articles as you want.I've edited a small article once before. No account, no past experience, etcThat's not what it meansNot true. There are some *awful* sounding choirs.How does it skew?Just use the [browser](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gizoogle/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) extension instead, it'll translate any page you want.There was literally no need to Rickroll here on an actually useful suggestion. Rickrolling is better used to bait people into clicking on content that doesn't actually exist.That is really cool. What was the topic you wrote?/u/smithsp86, I have found an error in your comment:\n\n > \u201cimpossible unless ~~your~~ [**you**] are one\u201d\n\nI recommend that smithsp86 type \u201cimpossible unless ~~your~~ [**you**] are one\u201d instead. \u2018Your\u2019 is a possessive determiner; \u2018you\u2019 is a pronoun.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!)Noooooo....humans are selfish and  only motivated to do anything if its in their own best interest.It's censorship, but for the most part it's not malicious. It's an attempt to remain objective, and avoid edit wars.Wikipedia also has a lot of autistic contributers and we can speak pretty matter of factly too :)shots firedI think you're right, and that at the same time the MoS is insanely influential, because it defines the very style that editors learn to imitate.\n\nAnd the size of it ... The [main page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style) alone is 28.000+ words, and that's basically just a summary. Of the more than 1800 links on the page, over 300 of them point to MoS related sub-topics.More like they get their interns or hire a PR company to edit things and no one else cares enough to notice if a page about a corporation looks too polished. No one who edits a company's article has \"high standings in the community\".He has started 35k out of over 6 million, so more like 0.5%. And the majority of his are bulk created by scripts - it\u2019s fairly easy to create 100s of articles about small villages using an input database for example. Wikipedia has 10s of 1000s of active editors - while this guy is undoubtably a legend for his largely thankless work it\u2019s pretty misleading to think that Wikipedia is some tiny community. It\u2019s one of the most popular websites on the internet and anyone can edit it after allWhy be a dick? He has contributed a lot to society.***\n[chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org) has [returned](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay22eeuujzv5tpdddskzg9y3nsqj2uvff99ptz) the unclaimed tip of `0.00201623 BCH`| `~   1.44 USD` to u/Tibanne.\n***Didn\u2019t really notice any \u201csly jabs\u201d didn\u2019t really seem bias at all, stuff like the government shutdown and \u201cmaking Mexico pay for it\u201d are just facts.

I just updated an article for an unpopular game to change the tone for past tense (page was last edited before the game came out) and the change was instantly reverted. Annoying but I wasn\u2019t going to fret over it.I actually blew up an entire section of the Wikipedia article on a potentially controversial topic because the sources were absolute fucking nonsense. Among other garbage the section cited [this abomination](http://rexcurry.net/drugdogsmain.html) that should be the *literal* textbook example of webpages you don't trust. Surprisingly my large deletions were never reversed.\n\nBut I try to change one sentence in the article about a video game and it gets reversed in minutes complete with snotty rebuttal in the talk page.\n\nWhat wiki detractors say about ignorant assholes 'adopting' articles and retaining control over the content through seniority and obstinance alone is quite true.Did you provide a source to support the change? That likely was the issue.The only editing I do Wikipedia is punctuations on articles about Mongolia\u2019s eastern provinces.\n\nIt\u2019s actually fun for me and is great work to help keep the site as accurate as possible and lighten the load of the editors.Augh, you got me browsing the page on \"Lamest Edit Wars,\" which has a section on meta-edit wars on the edit wars page and meta-meta edit warsThe rabid editors scare away newbies. I wanted to make an article for music producers I liked but they \"weren't notable\" enough and the article kept being deleted. I gave up eventually, then a few years later they got an article. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysto_and_Pizzi\nIf you were curious. I just liked those Geico ads lolThe amount of times I've edited random things on Wikipedia France to say \"baguette\" and they stayed around... as an American, I am glad my Wikipedia is so heavily moderatedInstead of editing articles, I go to the discussion page and ask there what the opinion is on the matter.\n\nOnly after a consensus has been made a change should happen, imo.I once made an edit to an article that had the out right audacity to LIE and say that Tribble were FROM the Klingon planet of Kronos. Disgusting misinformation.That's a real shame. Your edit probably broke some obscure style guidelines (and when you're starting out, every guideline is obscure), but by not letting you know which one you've just had a bad experience with your first interaction. That you said fuck it and never went back seems to be pretty common. It's thought to be the major cause of why there are so few female wikipedia editors\n\nBut I do encourage you to fix mistakes when you see them \ud83d\ude42This reminds me of a smaller controversy that didn\u2019t really go anywhere. \n\nAlex (French Guy Cooking) found a misconception about French mother sauces through a primary source (the creator of mother sauce\u2019s book in the original language), wrote a Wikipedia article about it, and a narcissist power hungry mod (Hippo43) removed it by saying that it\u2019s irrelevant. It still hasn\u2019t been readded.I used to love going to the page about Valkyries and changing it to say \u201cthe valkyries take their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, Valhalla, ruled over by the god Greg Oden.\u201d\n\nHaven\u2019t gone back and tried that change in a while.Yeah, you can see pages and pages on argument on basic things such as how to capitalize a word or other small stylish decisions.That may be a misunderstanding by you or by the teachers. It\u2019s not the edit feature that\u2019s the core objection. Generally, tertiary sources like encyclopedias are not allowed as an academic source. They can provide an excellent set of pointers to secondary and primary sources. But you\u2019re not supposed to use paper encyclopedias either.FYI, you didn\u2019t find a loophole or anything. Wikipedia is not a source. Wikipedia is a summary of other sources. \n\nEvery teacher or professor I ever had said to go to Wikipedia\u2019s sources and cite those.That's exactly what you're supposed to do.\n\nWikipedia is a great source of sources.You were doing what the teacher wanted. Wikapedia isnt a primary source. It doesnt matter what other people wrote about the primary source or how scholarly the wikapeda article is. It isnt a primary source and you cant confirm what is being written. Teachers want primary sources to show you actually did the work of reviewing the source yourself.About half of the Scot language encyclopedia is completely made up, and many other pages are made up too.\n\nThey try, but no organization can be perfect.And some controversial political things.\n\nTheres very...optimistic language on the 'trans rights' segments.Seriously, Wikipedia is great for most things, but anything involving modern politics is so biased I feel like I\u2019m reading Snopes or mainstream media opinion pieces or something.The center of humanity is surprisingly liberal.Neutral point of view.Why would anything \u201edeserve\u201c a more human tone in a scientific article? A scientific article shouldn\u2018t be judgemental in any sorts, wether ethically or morally. Because ethics and moral are things that change over time. So an article on wikipedia should just state the facts and not include any sort of judgement on wether those facts are \u201egood\u201c or \u201ebad\u201c because good or bad will change.I mean \n\nsome disturbing acts are rituals \n\nI dunno if I\u2019d describe nazism or eugenics as \u201csocial philosophy\u201d but they absolutely are a school of thought just as any other political ideology/ideal is. Academically, specifically academically mind you, they are just as valid as communism or libertarianism or anarcho primitism or whatever else.More human tone and emotional response? Can you explain what you mean? \n\nEven though I think Nazis are evil scum I don't expect to flip through the Encyclopedia Britannica and the article starts with \"Nazis are evil scum\".I\u2019ve seen non drawn pics on stuff in there beforeIt's not a bot, it's freelancers. There's a [Wikivisual bot](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Request-for-Wikivisual-on-wikiHow) where you upload requests for illustrations and it will add them to the article once they've been created, but a bot has no part in illustrating the images.Interesting, do you have more precisions about this? like a link or a paper describing thatWouldn\u2019t that still run afoul of copyright? You can\u2019t just trace a picture and call it a new work. Or are the stock images also public domain, and the tracing is to make them consistent?It's not bots, it's people in other countriesI highly doubt that. Converting a real life photo into the WikiHow style would be very difficult for a computer to do. You can probably do it with some ML algorithms, but you wouldn't get perfect results. And wikihow has used that style for years (long before ML algs were capable of that)You submit a real photo and submit it to a bot. Then wikihow freelancers work on converting that image you requested for the article into the iconic style you see.I always react when Wikipedia says \"we\", as in the human race. Like \"we decided to name it X because of Y\". It looks strangeBig articles have enough eyes on them that they tend to get tidied up in that way. More niche articles and especially niche articles in languages other than English can drift into more subjective writing and it really stands out.No I don\u2019t!\"When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all\". I took that to heart writing my thesis.I like comments like this, the biggest advantage we'll have over the machines is wit and sarcasm..to a machine this phrase simply would not compute - at least not in the way a human being intended it.Wait, Wikipedia is run by the genestealer cult?Kinda like Reddit, but smart.one of us\n\none of usIronic Reddit comment is ironic.Wait, Reddit and Wikipedia are the same thing?I won't defend most academics on their writing, but the language must be precise to avoid misunderstandings and remain concise.\n\nWhen describing small details of complex topics, it's impossible to write it in an approachable manner, because the subject itself isn't approachable and requires concerted effort to understand.I would argue that that's just bad academic writing, but it is also the case that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It's written to be readable by anyone potentially unfamiliar with the topic, and most terms that it doesn't explain can at least be hyperlinked to another article explaining those. \n\nI typically know very quickly reading an academic journal article if it wasn't written for me if it starts using undefined terms I don't understand or referencing work I've never read. Most of the time if an article is references another piece of work often enough, I just find that work and figure out how to incorporate it as a source instead.>   for no other reason than that it \"feels academic\", even though simpler phrasing could communicate the same thing better\n\n\nThere's actually a simple reason for this, which is that most academics cannot write. To the extent that they've learned, it is from imitating other academics who also cannot write.It's more that there's a desire/need for it to be very precise language. In the same way things written by lawyers can be a nightmare to read for a lot of people, you don't want there to be any uncertainty in what you've determined/discovered. Bad things happen when people misinterpret academic papers.It's because we're required to write in passive voice.. but people don't actually know how to write simple statements in passive voice. I don't really know why.. maybe like the other person said they're just imitating other bad writers.\n\nPersonally I like things to sound simple and straight forward.. and it's totally possible to do that while maintaining passive voice.Is it? I feel like Wikipedia is kinda [famous](https://xkcd.com/739/) for using needlessly academic-sounding language...I hated this when I was majoring in physics. The professors all adopted this style and understanding their problems was much more difficult than the problem itself. Sometimes I solved 2 different problems and then I had to decide which one is the most likely to actually have been the problem.\n\nThis style of writing is neither precise, nor is it sophisticated. It only makes them look like they're bragging.High-brow language is usually fine for me. However, many of them use words just for the sake of using them. Words that are either not suitable for the context or are mixed in with too many other elaborate words. I suppose this is what you are saying too haha. But I guess what I am saying is, high-brow writing can often be perfectly understandable and optimize the person's understanding. And other times, it's just completely unnecessary.Depends on what you're reading. The technical stuff is. It sort of has to be.  History or sociology.. maybe not.[deleted]I don't really know enough to speak on that. However, I do know that the kind of writing you find on sites like Wikipedia is at least meant to sound objective and unopinionated.OAN. It's all about objective Butters!When I didn\u2019t do the reading and had to use Wikipedia:\nTHE EMPEROR PROTECTS!God Emperor Pruitt of of BattlepediaKnowledge must flow.I was just going to comment about this.

(not doubting your word, I'm just curious, I've never really searched for something so obscure that Wikipedia got it wrong)\"The values started becoming inconsistent and skewed in Generation 2 and\u00a0Beast Wars, when Hasbro apparently thought no child will ever want a toy that is described as anything less than perfect.

The craziest thing with the whole fiasco is at multiple times actual speakers of the language call it out and they were overruled.I edit for Wikipedia and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d never heard of thisGoodbye my sweet sidesI can't believe that was only 5 months ago, felt like at least a yearSmawer than a toun\n\nLmfaoI _know_ it\u2019s a serious matter, but damn: this made me laugh so much!Did anything happened after that?\n\nOr is the Scottish wiki still a messtl;dr?5 months ago? The Scots Wiki thing did the round years ago. I thought it was an inside Wiki jokeDo you have wiki profile? If you are editing without one, the revision will be attributed to your IP Address. 9 times out of 10, edits by an IP address are vandalism and are reverted by bots, not people. A legitimate, sourced edit will almost never be simply undone by a human. Maybe reworded or moved to a different section, but not completely erased.Which is ironic, given the OP: wiki articles on video games that still exist (or at least are not proven to no longer exist in some form) are written in present tense. You got reverted for not keeping the \"consistent tone\".You'd be amazed by the amount of electrons spilled over how to refer to games, TV shows, magazines, computers, etc. which no longer functionally exist. Since they still exist in some form, most of the time, they are still referred to in present tense, but it is hotly debated.\n\nWould you say *I Love Lucy* was or is? How about Shakespeare's *Othello*?I'd ask wtf I just read but I couldn't read more than a few sentences of that website to justify saying I read the page. That site would be shitty by 90s standards. Then again it doesn't have animated gifs or tiled images on the background though, so saying it is shitth by 90s standards is a but harsh. Lets just go with \"this is one of the worst publicly available pages on the internet today.I personally haven\u2019t tried to change it but I can\u2019t be the only one to notice that the entirety of the \u201cBest selling media franchises\u201d is a complete fabrication. \n\nIt gets quoted all the time and apparently no one ever looked at the sources.This is why I mostly just complain in the talk page, I often don't have sources, am too unsure, or I'm asking for things to be explained in more detail. Unfortunately the talk pages seem pretty dead thoughI edited it only once without a source. It was my neighborhood being described as being in a county. About a month prior that stopped being the case as several counties were consolidated so I was then in a different country. So I just changed itYesI have done so in the past, it was reverted because someone who did a bunch of articles preferred their source, The Black Book of Communism.That seems like a pretty narrow niche. Is it because that's a passion of yours or do those articles gave really poor grammar for some reason?Well, they weren't wrong- it was deleted in 2009; in 2009 Mysto and Pizzi had made one song in a commercial and produced a couple others. There weren't really any sources about them out there, and so the article didn't meet guidelines that they were notable/sourced enough to get an article. Mysto and Pizzi didn't release their first singles (and more importantly didn't start getting news coverage about _them_) until 2011, and so of course when the article was recreated in 2016 no one took issue with it.For a lot of things I agree, but for simple things I think a sourced change is ok.\n\nLike if say there is an article of a baseball player and the article lists their debut as being a certain date, but that date is wrong. That is something that is pretty simple. If a proper source is provided, I don't think a discussion needs to occur.Wikipedia does not allow original research. In many cases the appropriate way to document a discovery of that kind is to make a video or blog post about it, which it sounds like he did.Not to mention [jokes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AScrod#A_funny_joke_about_scrod_and_Boston)you ever kinda feel like academia has yet to properly catch up with the internet?Encyclopedia Britannica is largely considered a primary source.

I could totally see someone tracing a stock photo and changing the context of the shot to make it different. Like using a photo of a an ordinary man and then drawing him as a doctor. Tracing in itself is not copyright infringement, the context of the photo and the drawing matter as well. If it is 100% traced and nothing is changed between the two, then yeah there might be a problem. It also depends on who's art is being traced. If it's some nobody, then there probably wont be legal reprecussions. \n\nThat said, in the art world it's really scummy to trace over for poses. Big no no (usually looks like shit) I can recall one particular guy in the comic industry that would use porn as tracing reference. When people find out about that... you cant go back.You can argue that the illustrations are only inspired by the originals and not copies because they\u2019re clearly not the same as the original ones.

Like, if you had to stop and explain what an angstrom is after using it to define a wavelength, then explain what a wavelength is, then relate wavelength to energy of a photon, then explain what that energy level means, etc., etc., for every paper you wrote, it would be so bogged down with unnecessary bullshit that other experts wouldn't need defined. The middle parts of academic articles aren't meant for people not versed in the subject matter.[deleted]Precise isn't the problem. You can be impeccably precise without being dense. When the article becomes an interminable stream of 4 line compound-complex sentences *that's* a problem.Shall we raise a glass to the definition of literally.\n\nThe idiots, see...they are breeding.I was working on some problems for fluid mechanics homework today and I found clean formatted LaTeX equations with detailed explanations of each case and variables. Honestly a joy.It's also that this type of writing is enforced by other academics who cling onto formalities and traditions.\n\nAt least that's my own experience. Writing a paper without full understanding of the subject matter but wrapped in the right tone is often better received than a fully understood, well constructed one in simpler language.\n\nThis pattern continues even into the lectures. We were given plenty of faulty notes where a complicated formulation or formula was actually pure nonsense because it contained critical mistakes (and be it just using the wrong character for a variable or index somewhere), when the whole thing could have easily been described in 2-3 simple sentences instead.\n\nI think the vast majority of academic knowledge should first be described in simple language and only then be followed up with a formal mathematical or technical description. This way it becomes way easier to contextualise the formal parts and to correct for possible inaccuracies or mistakes they may contain.Clinical things are boring by default.  \n\nColor adds opinion.\"To the extend that they've learned, it is from imitating other academics who also cannot write\" \n\nThis in a very unnatural sounding sentence. Are you an academic?Hmm no yhe reason is most academic work is written for people wothin their field and is full of field specific terms and language and a doffere t persons comes in and thinks theyre being ptetensions. No theyre using words that convey what they want to dayRequired to use active voice? It may be my field, but passive voice is the form that's frowned on.Nah, like straight up truth like Adrian Zenz being a raging antisemite who believes Jesus will descend from heaven to murder every Jew with his bare hands, beliefs which he publishes on his personal website. But which you will not find referenced on his Wikipedia page because that would derail their presentation of Zenz as an urbane and erudite international intellectual.In, the founder of wikipedia made a very compelling article with very well referenced sources (not surprising but very refreshing) on this very subject.

Stick with areas that are local in scope, or related to your field of expertise, at least at first.\n* Your edits should be relevant to the article and encyclopedic in nature.

Don't go off on something tangential or add unimportant trivia.\n\n\n> No point at all doing anything even if you wanted to edit the page about yourself.\n\n* Editing a page about yourself is a conflict of interest.

I'm curious what the game was, and suspect that what you actually did was change the date to whatever Mobygames' user-edited database said the date was.He didn\u2019t say that he actually cited google maps, just that he mentioned it on the talk page. Plus, he would\u2019ve had to properly cite the specific location for it to be valid.Yes I know what neutral point of view is.

I find this to be true.I\u2019ve made thousands of edits and written 20 or so articles so I don\u2019t really agree - the rules are a bit hard to get your head around at first, and like anywhere you\u2019ll find some jobsworths that\u2019ll revert your edits for no reason, but those standards are the reason that quality is as high as it is. The \u2018controllers\u2019 are normal people like you and me. Or bots a lot of the time. \n\nIf there\u2019s something in particular you\u2019d like to improve I\u2019m very happy to helpWait what?It was only 5 months ago? Time is blending for me. :(Scots is a language spoken in Scotland. While similar to English, it's its own language. Some American teenager wrote nearly all 60,000 articles in the Scots Wikipedia without any knowledge of the language. They basically just copy pasted the English articles and spelled everything phonetically with a Scottish accent. This led to people all over the world having the Wikipedia articles as their only exposure to the language and debatably caused massive harm to the language and its image as a whole.\n\nKinda tragic but also some of the funniest shit I've ever read in my life.Roughly 20.000 of the 60.000 Scots Wikipeda pages were written by a random american who doesn't speak the language. He just translated english articles word for word into Scots and in the end it all just sounded like broken english. He had also been the Scots Wikipedia moderator for 7 years.Nope the OG post was only 5 months ago.Changing the tense probably doesn't need a source, but explaining the change in the edit summary is helpful as well. IP edits with no edit summary modifying existing text are *very* likely vandalism.Why even allow IP edits at that point?> A legitimate, sourced edit will almost never be simply undone by a human. \n\nTell that to the guy who undid an edit I made that literally added a sentence to an obscure article. I had a source listed and reason for change. It wasn't even changing information, it was actually clarifying a vague reference someone else had made to the source, but they had failed to cite it. I would consider myself an expert on the matter and realized what they were referring to, so I added some clarification and a source.\n\nLess than 2 hours later some random dude had reverted it back.I think they were saying the page was created before the game was released, and thus had future tense wording in some areas, i.e. \"the game will be released on X day\" and changed it to say \"the game was released on X day\". Thats accurate and how it should be once the release date arrives.You would say \"*I Love Lucy* **was** a show that aired between X and Y years. The show's story **is** about Z. *Othello* **was** written in X year. It **is** about Y. They **are** regarded as classics, and **were** a massive hit with their audience.\"Mate I was changing phrases like \u201cTo be released on May 10, 2017\u201d to \u201cWas released on May 10, 2017\u201d it wasn\u2019t that deepDepends. The Donald Trump one is pretty active for example.\n\nSometimes I go on the Talk pages of controversial figures and watch the debates. Fascinating stuff.\n\nMy favourite was in the run up to Trump leaving the presidency. There was a HUGE debate about how to reword the first sentence of the article to say that he \"Was\" the president. It was extremely hard to get a consensus on something that basic.\n\nUsually there are a couple of high-level editors who hang around to curate specific controversial articles. They are exasperated by all the requests and the complaints and revert everything without a major consensus. Honestly recommend reading this stuff, it truly is fascinating to me.It makes sense really. It feels like any other creative endeavor. There are a bunch of people who would be happy to provide direction and ideas. There are smaller set of people who are willing to give it a go but can\u2019t manage to do it right, sometimes because they realize it\u2019s too much work.  And then there\u2019s a subset of people who take the time to figure out the requirements and actually deliver on some content.\n\nAnybody who has ever done a group project knows the dynamic.Haha no, they are just small obscure and random articles I go over and sometimes find an incomplete sentence or a wrong punctuation. There are millions of articles and not all of them are perfect and shows that it isn\u2019t bots making these articles but people.It's not because they don't like internet. It's because Wikipedia is not the **source** of the knowledge. It's just a hub to find it all at one place.I do, but in this case I think academia is right.   \n\nFor an Internet argument, quoting  Wikipedia is 1 billion times better than saying what you think you remember or what some guy told you or tell him the other guy to do his own research. It\u2019s a great place to find information. \n\nIf you were going to the effort to do a paper on some thing, it\u2019s worth it to track down a couple of the sources instead of relying on Wikipedia. It forces you to double check that Wikipedia\u2018s excerpt or summary is correct. It gives you access to a broader range of information and insight into the topic. It teaches you a bit about actually researching a topic is supposed to letting somebody else do the research for you.  \n\nIf I want to argue about who played a certain character in a movie, I can look it up on the Internet. If I\u2019m going to write a critical analysis of the films of Orson Welles, I should probably watch all the films and read a couple books about them before I write my thesis.Academia makes good use of the internet and academic librarians are one of the best sources that you (yes, youuuuuu) never knew you had for learning how to look up all sorts of crazy shit that's on the internet but you can't find on Google\n\nsee also: the early internet was universities connecting their computers togetherMy university's style and citation guides had rules on how to cite all sorts of different types of websites way back in 2005, and the professors would whisper \"psst, use the references at the bottom of the Wikipedia article, butyoudidnthearthatfromme\", and the library's orientation was basically \"our internal systems sucks, just use Google scholar\" so I think academia has something of a grasp on the internet in 2021.By definition it\u2019s not a \u201cprimary\u201d source in that it is not written by the people who (for science) gathered the data, nor by the people who (for history) were eyewitnesses to a historical event. Encyclopedias & textbooks are generally classed as tertiary sources. (Primary = eyewitness account; secondary = summary by someone who directly read the primary sources; tertiary = summary of the summaries). It is a very good tertiary source and generally accepted as trustworthy, but trustworthiness is a different metric than primary-secondary-tertiary.What?Wow this is the biggest sub of this size I don\u2019t know about. SubbedYes, though there are a some actual artists that contribute as well. A couple of the artists actually have rather distinct styles and you can immediately recognize an article illustrated by them.\n\nWhen I was younger I followed a deviantart account that gave writing advice with illustrations. The account owner also contributed illustrations to wikihow.I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s traced stock images but I do doubt that it\u2019s a bot. Are you sure it\u2019s not just underpaid freelancers?I'd forgotten how amusing that sub is. Thank you.it's nondisclosure contracts with people hired from things like fiverr, typically older teenagers looking to dip their toes into commission work.\n\ni did some as a teen and was always told the images i was drawing were (supposedly) for \"children's books in hong kong\" and literally nothing else. a lot of the time you just don't know who or what you're drawing for and a lot of the money you get is under the table.\n\none of my profs did something similar and later found out they were printing the characters he drew onto cardboard cutouts for use at shooting ranges.Thought you might be exaggerating but [nope](https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2019/11/comics-and-kink-greg-land-and-the-sexy-digital-art-debate/)Countries with cheap workforce.

From what I can tell from [Purdue](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/active_and_passive_voice/active_versus_passive_voice.html) and [other academic](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/scholarlyvoice/activepassive) writing guides, scientific fields often write passively while most others generally write actively.\n\nMy faculty advisor completely red-penned one of my early thesis drafts because I used too much passive voice. After some irritation, I realized she was right. The active voice shortened and clarified my sentences.Hardly compelling. He cites his own work (which itself lacks citations) in three of his seven sources and cites interpretations of the bible twice. He makes an argument that Donald Trump's article is \"overtly negative\" - specifically pointing out the number of falsehoods espoused by the President. Here I ask: Is that not in line with reality?  \n\nIt sounds like he's slowly become radicalized - complaining about the lack of Hilary Clinton scandals in President Obama's page and \"disproportionate level of coverage\" over Trump's scandals compared to his Presidency. I disagree that it's well cited and while I am loathe to launch ad hominem attacks - he seems deadly biased in his appraisal. Wikipedia's entry on his criticism of Wikipedia is far better cited than his criticism of Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger#Relationship_with_Wikipedia  \n\nThat's not to say his concern isn't valid but it's clear he's massively biased (in a sad twist of irony).Jennifer doesn't exactly look like she's stopping traffic either.This makes me happy and sadNo clue dude.. The only reason I even know I wrote this text is because I had an inbox message of your comment\"Academic casual\"Yeah true dat. I was just trying to find a description but I think yours is betterThe duality of manNiceNo you bothWho are you the Wikipedia Mod PR team\n\nNothing you listed matters at all if someone with the power just deletes it because they want to\n\nThe only point of a page about yourself was that even if you were a direct source that actually knew with 100% certainty what you were writing someone would delete it even if you sourced some shit site.\n\nIts a collection of what a small number of crowned people want it to be. That is all it is.Have to agree, that is pretty unheard of2020 was an awful year, I can\u2019t wait for it be over.> Roughly 20.000 of the 60.000 Scots Wikipeda pages were written by a random american who doesn't speak the language. \n\nSmall clarification of how insane this is - it was *at least* 20,000 as of 2018 when he stopped updating his count of how many he'd done.That\u2019s fucking hilariousMost high profile/trafficked pages are protected from IP edits (meaning they cant even access the edit page), but the vast majority aren't. I agree, I dont think they should be allowed at all but I didnt make the website.We've had 43 other 'was-es', what was so complicated there?> and shows that it isn\u2019t bots making these articles but people.\n\nWas that a concern we had?you say that but my entire grad school class didnt even know inter library loan existed...\n\ni know we had academic librarians but hunting them down was a mega hassle lolMake sure you join /r/notdisneyvacation as well. It's hilarious to see a post, read the title, and try to guess which sub it's from.Definitely underpaid freelancers. A friend of mine used to work for them and they paid a dollar per illustration, and it's done per article so you have to illustrate around 5-20+ slides. Hence the qualityTLDW:  Odessa is a shithole, and the Wikipedia article was apologetic for subjecting the reader to facts about it.You can actually review the [changes that are made to a wiki page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Odessa,_Texas&dir=prev&limit=500&action=history) \n\nFor instance, someone at one point put a link to a [myspace page titled DUBBSICKS!](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Odessa,_Texas&diff=167954930&oldid=166918400)[Humans be like](https://i.imgur.com/ZebWtGr.jpg)Full r/redditmoment on WikipediaThat made me chuckle. Like, if we ever end up endangered, is someone gonna change it?\nThe last action by man on earth is changing it to extinct? Totally agree on how the uninterrupted monologue would go.\n\nIn his later years Data might have been the one to cut himself off mid sentence, perhaps even going so far as to lament the obvious disinterest of his listeners.*insert meme of Obama giving himself a medal*Would like to see him give Jeopardy a go.chadIs it bad that he looks exactly like I'd expect a wikipedia editor to look like?That guy who just happens to live in Langley, VA?Ugh you've just reminded me. Little cunt. Sorry I mean wee och aye mihimminy hoo cunt.Good luck with the extra limbs, I've heard slaanesh loves themr/thatsthejoke.jpgWhich explains a lot about how well it works /sI think that's what the commenter you replied to was suggesting.Don't say that part out loud, it could offend the advisorsYep. I still remember the horrors of our image processing course, which expressed extremely simple concepts purely in the most abstract and mathematical language (frequently with errors or lacking key details).\n\nWe had a course in 3D graphics at the same time where I learned far more about image processing than in image processing  Things that we brooded over for hours in IP  were seen as small details that we could understand in two paragraphs and a few lines of code in 3D. Probably because that professor had actually worked in the industry and needed to communicate with real people before.\n\nAnd at the end of that I had a far better ability to understand technical papers related to  topics \n from 3D than from IP because I understood that much more of its context. The idea that struggling through technical language is the best way to learn how to deal with it just isn't true.He's a leading spellcheck algorithm programmer.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological\\_bias\\_on\\_Wikipedia#Bias\\_in\\_content\\_in\\_relation\\_to\\_U.S.\\_politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_bias_on_Wikipedia#Bias_in_content_in_relation_to_U.S._politics)\n\nWell here is what wikipedia has to say on their bias. So while what you said is pretty damning on the character and bias of Larry Sanger himself, even wikipedia admits to bias in their articles.I think the general insistence on full sentences and having an intentional structure look academic if you\u2019re in school, but it\u2019s closer to the style I would use for an email to a coworker than the style I would use for anything in a university class or read in a scholarly paper, which is what I think of when of when I hear \u201cacademic.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019m just being pedantic, which is also a classic of the Reddit style.Academic casual is how actual academic writing *should* be (to an extent), it makes the topics discussed more accessible to a general audience, just because the writer used \"obfuscate\" instead of \"make it harder to understand\" doesn't make it better writing, and I really wish universities would teach that.\n\nEvery time I see \"in short\" written in a piece of academic writing it makes me want to cry. If a writer can restate their original 3 sentences in 1 much easier to understand one, and still convey the *exact same message*, then they did a bad job on the first 3. \n\nIndeed in an age of information, where English dominates in academic writing, exchange of ideas should be made vastly more comprehensible regardless of intersectionalities, and economic/societal barriers. Passing of knowledge between people shouldn't require strenuous work if one has the capacity to understand it in its most basic form. Yet throughout academia, these institutions seem to be putting in borderline quantifiable effort into making it *arbitrarily more tedius and difficult* for the readers to grok the work. In short, why say many word when few word do trick?> Nothing you listed matters at all if someone with the power just deletes it because they want to\n\nSo, I just checked my stats. I've made 11,777 edits and had 142 deleted. That's 1.2%. I can think offhand of maybe a half dozen times that someone reverted my edits where I disagreed with it. Out of 11,777 edits.\n\nIf you're getting your edits reverted frequently, you're probably breaking the rules or using a non-neutral point of view.[deleted]It was about what was important enough to be mentioned in the lede (e.g. that he is a businessman etc) along with his presidency. They just couldn't get a consensus so \"was\" is all they could do basically.\n\nI just find it funny how grindingly hard it is to get any change on an article like that.Sounds like the fault of your institution, when I worked at our uni library system we were told specifically to offer to look up books (we didn't have) on ILL for patronssame if you join /r/MovieDetails and /r/shittymoviedetailsThat is fucking HILARIOUS. Thank you so muchThere's also /r/maybedisneyvacation, which automates the process.Thanks!> TLDW: Odessa is a shithole,\n\nSure but it did help with a great football movie.How very Canadian of them.Lmao I just was in Odessa for the first time last week (I work in oil) and I can confirm that place is a shithole. Some good Mexican food though.We can finally return from *mostly harmless*  back to *harmless* as it was written in the good book.Tbh I think later Data would be accustomed enough to human manners of speech to not take the question literally, at least without clarifying first.And just like that, I am transported back to 1992.[Relevant](https://img.ifunny.co/images/b5ac4645dd1b859c3b2c8d5ba0497034d29c780e9ae27e7123eb7949847f7a4f_1.jpg)*X-Files theme song*Truth. Bugs and malware are both a thing in law.Probably. I'm a bottle of wine deep. I disagree that it's imprenatable though.It's an acquired skill learning to properly read research papers, exactly as you put it, these aren't meant for 'real people' but for people who are already in the field. \n\nSource: 4 PhDs and 2 university professors in my 'family' so to speak.I've had those exact same experiences and agree 100%.According to that article, most recent additions to Wikipedia don't lean politically one direction or the other, and bias is even less on articles with frequent contributionsOh, no doubt there. I remember back when Jimmy Wales got caught editing his own page to remove references to Sanger. It seems the most recent review found mega-pages (with lots of edits and sources) to be more neutral than average.Personally, I read the tone on here the same way I read my friends masters thesis. New users try to keep things clean and concise, but after a few months it slips into \"semi-professional throwing words at a wall\"Nice.>If a writer can restate their original 3 sentences in 1 much easier to understand one, and still convey the *exact same message*, then they did a bad job on the first 3.\n\nExactly this hurts me and I see it so often. Just like when you learn how to write a letter in school. Why do I need a beginning, middle, end, and summary, if all I need to say can be summarised..I'm just learning about this, but apparently he just ran it through an online translator and picked the first result. Sounds like it could have been done by a bot.That's at least a discussion about content.\n\nHere is a discussion if it should be aluminium or aluminum:\n\n[Page 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aluminium/Spelling/Archive_1), [page 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aluminium/Spelling/Archive_2), [page 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Aluminium/Spelling/Archive_3).Likewise with /r/interestingasfuck and /r/notinteresting.With clear eyes and love in your heart.Friday night lights? I loved that movie, and I get the ending and everything...but damn. I couldn't believe (spoilers ahead) they fucking lost! It was like the anti-ending. I like the first couple seasons of the show, but then it got really heavy with the teenage melodrama and totally implausible scenarios.Not only that, it\u2019s home to a particularly important cheerleader.I bet, regarding the Mexican. Makes me want to go there, for lunchI like to think that his behaviour isnt always as innocent and befuddled as his screen time suggests. Like maybe he just wanted to practicea passive aggressive behaviour, and hes playing a game of malicious compliance.  Or maybe he got tired of Sherlock Holmes on the holodeck and ended up with Amelia Bedelia instead.I feel personally attacked.I mean, have you read the articles? That's not scots, that's english with an accent. There might ve a bot for that, but that's no translationThere's also an epic discussion on whether the model train scale is HO or H0 [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:HO_scale#Number_0_versus_letter_O)\n\nIt even got a mention [in an xkcd](https://xkcd.com/878/).AirbudIts what happened in real life. 1988.\n\nFun fact- In 1988, Permian actually lost to Dallas Carter in the semis but for the movie they changed it to the championship.",

Very cool class. Now I'm wondering how much your showerthought is accurate. And if you work somewhere that bans cell phones guess what's on all the stall walls? PeniiHere I sit broken hearted \nTried to shit, but a gif startedCan confirm, was an asshole that carried sharpies just to draw shitty things and sayings places now I just browse reddit when I poop. \"Here I lie in stinky vapour,\n\nCos some bastard stole the toilet paper.\n\nShall I lie or shall I linger,\n\nOr shall I be forced to use my finger.\"Clicking a dick pic is easier than drawing one \u261d\ud83c\udffb Sometimes I use my phone to google a reference image to work from while I draw on the bathroom stall and wall.

When I see a nice piece of crappy graffiti I always long for a sharpie I never have.Still the same amount of boogers on the walls.Some people still make bathroom graffiti when they watch porn on their phone, not with a marker pen though.Pitty, I like having things to read in the toilet.Have often thought, the internet is the new public toilet wallWash these walls to silence my pen\nBut the shithouse poet strikes AGAIN!Reddit IS public bathroom graffiti I'm curious I had the same shower thought about a month ago but didn't get near the same response as this post did. What could I do differently? By no means do I think OP stole my thought. Realizations happen to several people all the time. I'm just curious why this one got 50k when mine barely broke 1000 (which is actually a ton for my posts).  https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/8gi5fv/smart_phones_seem_to_have_done_wonders_in Brilliant deduction! I never noticed the decrease in bathroom graffiti, but now that you mention it, of course. Now people can write their hatespeech in a comment section while dropping a deuce and not on the wall. You must be either male or a professional cleaner, because only men's rooms were covered in swastikas and obscenities.This was talked about yesterday on Bob and Tom. Interesting timing of this post.

Currently shitting in a public restroom, looking at reddit on a smartphone. No graffiti in sight. No it haven\u2019t, ppl who will write graffiti in a toilet will still do so. Before other people might scribble in a bathroom wall but not much more.. u won\u2019t see a toilet full of regular think pen tagsThey also make people stay longer in cubicles, finishing that text or post to Reddit.My favourite bathroom graffiti was in my university, next to the toilet roll it said \u201cHumanity degree dispenser\u201d. Of coarse the bathroom was in the science building.In my experience, toilet graffiti has gotten better since smartphones. Graffiti artists get off on people sharing photos of their work.Yes - that graffiti is now on the walls of the Internet. They also increased the lines for the bathroom.instead people just graffiti in the internet with shit posts. i saw a meme of this.. nice repost/recycling of a comic strip. Probably partially responsible for reposts and unoriginal commentary as wellTimely: read while pooping at a rest stop. Hadn't thought of that, but I think you're right. See hardly any of that, now. However, there may be another cause - toilet stalls are now made of different types of materials, resistant to scratching and markers.Smart phones reasonable for increased red patches above knees. Reddit is virtual graffiti.I think you misunderstand the nature of a graffiti artist.  Smart phones are more responsible for you not noticing graffiti. My schools comp Sci building bathrooms always had the best graffiti, I\u2019ll miss those stall masterpieces And an increase in pink eyeThis post is genius.When\u2019s the last time you saw a high school bathroom? I promise smart phones have changed nothing. LolNope because taggers take phone pics of their tags\n\nDudes have Instagram accounts, you know, because they're \"artists\"Just weigh that against the crippling outbreaks of depression, anxiety, suicide among children and extreme political polarization all attributable to smartphones and it's about a neutral impact on society.Until they invent an app to virtually graph images from your phone on to real life objects/surfaces.The smart phone is the greatest invention since slice bread can confirm, shitting in an airport bathroom and see no vandalism, maybe because its a french airport?What a shame. As I\u2019m currently sitting and shitting... I needed this.\n\n*puts marker back in pocket*Do you mean toilet papers?I beg to differ that graffiti has seen any reduction.BRB, gonna write this on a puplic toilet. Yet the #1 problem in unwanted dick picsAlso probably responsible of less incidence of road rage since people are less in a rush, cause they be on their phones Women\u2019s bathrooms in Michigan are still covered in shitty graffiti. I don\u2019t know how many times I had to remove from the stalls  \u201chere I shit broken hearted.

They've perfected the art of dunny desecration!\n\nEdit: prefected to perfected [deleted]My brain read that as gravity and I was thoroughly confused for 20 seconds People write on bus seat about their love and hate of others. Now, they post of FB walls of mention it in tweet. Similarly, phone numbers are found in toilet and now they appear in an app. Just as easy.TIL Graffiti in public bathrooms has been reducedExcept then they take pictures of their artwork.And also contribute to the waiting times..Never was one for graffiti but i know without a phone id be one bored mofo. Ibs has mr on the can a lot. Can confirm. I work at a plant where phones are forbidden and the bathrooms are littered with graffiti.I.. I thought this said \"reducing *gravity*\" I was like \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14Well damn. I'm reading this as I take a shit and you're probably right. And for the long wait lines ToiletthoughtsA surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.I think its safe to say that most people who vandalize public restrooms are students of some sort who carry around a pen or Sharpie.Reading this on the throneNever thought about that. I like it though. Except on Marine bases where there is glorious penis art, it would be a shame to lose that.Repost Also responsible for no longer having to read the labels on the back of shampoo bottles This stuff is precisely what he researched.  Funny thing is, it was a Debate class You haven't been inside Kuma's bathrooms thenWhen AR is fully integrated into our society I expect graffiti to become mostly digital.Depends on the demographics. I was in the military just a few years ago and the graffiti game was alive and wellNow, instead of writing stupid shit on the bathroom wall, people just post it on Facebook.True, I haven't seen any evidence of people playing snot darts for a while.At least until AR stickers are shareable.  and fiber.Can confirm. At Basic training no one had phones and everyone had sharpies. There was a staggering amount of dick art in all shapes and sizes all over port-o-johnsEh, at my school there is plenty of penis\u2019s drawn all over every single wall.... Tried it with my Stylus once. Spoiler Alert: It went shit.Some come here to sit and think,\n\nSome come here to shit and stink,\n\nI come here to read Reddit,\n\n.Reposts are responsible for reposts.I think graffiti's often made by schoolchildren and they're always have one marker))) I would say: Smartphones are responsible for digitizing the graffiti to online wallAs I sit here with phone in hand...how will i learn your moms phone number now?And increasing pink eyeJust wait until AR becomes mainstream Not at my jobAnd bussesCome on my shitposts on this sub always get instantly removed. Shove it OPI for one look forward to the wonderful merging of tradition and tech so QR codes are hand drawn on walls to link to amusing things. I\u2019m probably sure this is true. Whoever wrote this must have been listening to the Bob and Tom show yesterday. There needs to be an app where when you walk around public areas you can see \u201cgraffiti\u201d or tags people have put on areas. LYeah fuck that we have Reddit for shitting entertainment Lol....right  on it.....This is *exactly* what they said on the Bob & Tom morning radio show yesterday. Good timing!Wow. YesAnd greatly increase hemorrhoids...I can barely get my shit into the toilet let alone a sharpie You\u2019ve been sitting too longNot in the military. It is probably the best part of taking a shit. Now people just write their shitty thoughts on Reddit instead....In my old workplace, I created \"newspaper\" pages on each stall door.  \nWrote articles about the higher-ups, making fun of them.  \nThey had a big bounty out, trying to find who it was.  \nJackie Schwarber you're a fat ass! Haha So many people used to be up 'for a good time'. Ex-Toilet writer here. Totally gotta agree with this guy. Used to write on the bathroom walls constantly if I didnt have a newspaper or something, while at work. And being a guy who used to work on flightlines in the USAF, I constantly had pens of all types on me (for work purposes) to effectively write fun things on stall walls....Now that I am mostly entertained by my phone, I just havent done it...  \nThat is a toilet thought, not a shower thought. There market saves the day once again.Freakanomics shit right thereI was thinking something similar yesterday. I wonder  if the invention of picture messages reduced the instances of flashers. Guys don't need to go in public to expose themselves to women and get their kicks anymore.And improving the quality [I saw this once and thought it was pretty funny.](https://i.imgur.com/V8CIYcm.jpg)Probably...Litterally taking a shit as I read this That and I never have a sharpie on meMy new goal in life is to print out little Reddits on sticky notes & plaster bathrooms all round the world. And responsible for increasing number of youtube commentsTo carry it a little further - Reddit is probably equally responsible for reducing graffiti in public toilets.Good One. Though innovation is lesser owing to that.. :)Well that explains why social media is so crazy. I guess that's where they put all the graffiti they would have otherwise smeared on the stalls in shit-writingNo more shitting up the stalls. More shitposting online.Why shitpost in a stall when you can shitpost online?That it or they increased the quality of the drawings Or possibly increasing? Idk man, have you seen the restroom at my local grocery store? Yet my former workplace. With a median company age of 45; still had a crudely drawn set of boobs in the stalls. I like the idea the bathroom graffiti is not preplanned but a result of bordem and lack of optionsYa, I no longer need to call the number in the stall for \"a good time\" because there are \"HOT LOCAL SINGLES IN MY AREA!\"I don't get thisI don't get this. If I was going to tag a bathroom I'd have a marker or engraving tool on me.Hi Steve Jobsr/tolietthoughtsMy school tried to remove bathroom graffiti last year by painting over it.\n\nTurns out, the paint they used didn\u2019t cover it and instead made it more obvious.Talking Shit Beyond the Stall(TM)I read graffiti as giraffesAnd TinderAnd for increasing DickPicsOh for sure.

Not at my job sitePeople just find other ways to break the law. And increasing the incidence of hemorrhoids! This is true. I went to Mars, where there aren\u2019t any smart phones, and there was no graffiti in the bathrooms. And also responsible for the death of the magazine rack in the bathroom at homeI've had this thought.  Who needs to write things like [\"Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name \u201cF**kface Von Clownstick\u201d like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...\"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/330359969813770242) on the bathroom walls anymore?\n\n\nWait until the \"Wall Tattoo App\" will be released.

In the army, toilets on base are fine, but ports potties in the field where there is no phone signal....penises and vaginas everywhereOr cataloging it I read this in a clean public toilet.\n\nEdit:  maybe \"on\" is more appropriate.Maybe before smartphones, they should have had bottles of shampoo and air freshener...Definitely responsible for more poop germs on phonesI read graffiti as giraffes - mental image was wildProbably increased graffiti that people pretend to stumble upon for karma In the past they would publish full books on the ingredients of shower gel cans, so as to prevent boredom.For a good time Snapchat Jenny. Smartphones were probably invented to keep stealing our time.I reckon Grindr alone has helped a lot.This would make for a fun but useless studyI can't even remember what I used to do with my time on the toilet before phones. Such wasted time! Nope. Its still happening at my workMight explain why we lack content in /r/ShitHousePoet/So we blame responsible ppl who are always prepared with a pen/marker just in case they need it?Unless you go to where people are too poor for a cell phone One time some kid drew a gigantic willy on the boys bathroom wall. The janitor tried all year to wash the disturbingly detailed shlong of the wall. But it never vanished. I\u2019d rather look at toilet graffiti that sit on my smartphone and end up on the toilet for 30 minutes.  Obviously, you\u2019ve never worked on a construction site that has scaffolders from New Zealand working on it.\n\nLiterally every single toilet on our site is well kept except the ones the scaffolders use, which are near their crib huts.Now people can just use apps instead of putting their number on the wall!Don\u2019t get it Graffiti and glory holes\"studies show...\"Shame....i used to enjoy reading about how much Terry loved cockSo thats why they call it shitposting! okay, who let grandpa on the internet?Now I sit here broken hearted... Came to shit but only farted.They're also responsible for the death of an entire artform: bathroom poetry. Or at least better better rhymes...The Internet is the new public toilet.And the rise of pink eye...This may be true, but I believe they have led to a massive net increase in \u201cshit\u201d posting.Yeah, people post that stuff online instead of writing it on a physical wall\"For a good time call 867-5309\"... \n\nOr Sherona. You know how SHE is.Get to Liverpool in England. Our public toilets are filled with quotes & funny shitI was taking an elevator the other day and it had a big white poster board type thing on the wall and it read ' if you must doodle, do it on here'. It seemed to have worked pretty well. Smart phones are responsible for a lot of stuff, good and bad.\n\nGOOD - it's less crowded on subways and buses because people read their phones, not laptops and newspapers.  Saves trees and other natural resources, because nobody has to read newspapers, paper books or magazines anymore, saves back strain because people don't have to lug around heavy electronic appliances like laptops unless they need a full blown computer for work.\n\nBAD - All the consequences of people driving and walking while distracted by staring at their phones...traffic accidents, pedestrians being hit by cars because they are not paying attention, etc...r/shittingthoughtsOn the toilet right nowwell now it just all ends up on TwitterOr giving people a reference image This probably very accurate.I'm actually mind blown by this shower thought. Personally as a Writer, I know it's all about timing. I have only been arrested and charged with a graffiti related crime once. Smartphones won't stop graffiti.Lol, don't ask why, because I have no idea.... But I originally read it as \"Smart phones are probably responsible for reducing GRAVITY in public toilets.\" True. Smart phones are also in part responsible for a lot of deaths. The amount of people who are recording things they should be running from. Damn, sorry so dark this morning. Not in the military.Smart phones are probably responsible for reducing creativity in people.What public toilets are you using? I want to see some non graffiti'd public toilets...Who uses their phone in a toilet? Errrm unhygenic or potential uneccessary spread of germs and bacteria?Before smartphones, people were more likely to have a pen and notepad - now there is a memo app to replace that needSome people have personal \u201ctags\u201d that you see everywhere. The people who have those, who tag shit, probably have their pens with them all the time. \n\nEdit: it\u2019s a pretty cool art. Shameless plug for one of my favorite subs: r/bombingI knew a kid who did that shit. He always had a marker for that reason. They also carve that stuff in with a knife from what I've been seeing lately.Are you saying that people actually *think* about drawing graffiti in toilets and the *go to the trouble* of carrying markers to draw in toilets?\n\nMan. That\u2019s dedication. I would take permanent markers with me to concerts to have my CD covers signed. I usually hid them in my shoes or bra so security wouldn't take them away. I carry a pen in my purse just in case (exchange info for car accident, cross items off my shopping list, etc.). Beyond that, I don't know.I marked up bathrooms when I worked in a factory as a teen fresh out of high school a decade ago. \n\nBut I was in a factory that made car parts for Honda so we always had permanent markers on us for marking defect pieces, so it was just a matter of having the marker in my pocket. \n\nMostly we played open-source tic-tac-toe. Pooper makes a move, next pooper makes a move, and so on. The side effect was you knew exactly how many people had used a given stall since the last time you used it. It's premeditated murder Yeah actually.\n\nGrowing up, if you net a girl you liked you should have a paper and pen or risk never linking up again. Premeditated. Tagging is still a thing, even worse these days. Less kids are making art, more are scratching scribbles on train windows. If they arent kicking them out that isPeople getting poorer to buy pens and simply opt for a digital alternative but the ultimate kicker is that people are getting too used to slangs and spellcheckers they can\u2019t even spell correctly anymore. I always have a permanent marker in my coat pocket and yes it's always premeditated. I learned the habit from a girlfriend of mine and while she was a remarkable artist I was of the opinion that having a captive audience was the best time to challenge their belief systems by writing thought provoking or inspiring statements. I also don't carry a smartphone so there may be some truth and insight to this shower thought. I guess I have done it premeditated once, but it was only to change a swastika into a window.In college, I always had a paint marker on my person. I had some friends in high school that would tag all sorts of stuff and they carried around pens. So I guess it\u2019s a combination of both.\"Went into a bar with my friends, had to go to the bathroom. So I went in there, I sat down, and somebody had written on the stall, \"Metallica rules.\" Under that it said, \"Metallica sucks.\" Under that it said, \"you suck.\" Under that it said, \"fuck you.\" I just thought, \u201cman, a lot of people shit with pens\"Premeditated. Always carry a marker.Yes. Did you not get the memo? Vandals have spray paint and markers with them all the time, deep pockets and baggy pants make it easier for themPre meditated graffiti, today I thought about tagging you Majority = Premeditated (Graffiti artist usually carry some type of writing utensil at all times \"in case\" . \n\nRest = people that happen to have a pen on them and decide to add to the bathroom gallery. \n\n\nSource: mischief-making associates.  As a r/shithousepoet myself. I can confirm. The only reason a smartphone would stop me is because Reddit is more important while pooping than graffiti. At work I generally always have one in my back pocket that I forget about when going to the toilet until it falls to the ground as I pull down my jeans. Girls pants pockets are generally fake or virtually useless on the front so back pockets hold everything for me. Have never graffetied with it, maybe once when drunk, can't confirm. Use to tag everything! toilet seat with a rock or scribe and spit on it and rub with dirty shoe to fill in with dirt. Mirrors with scribes same with tile. Never with market since they can erase that. At work everyone had the same king sized sharpie with them to tag wood as we cut it.  If you deliver or receive packages hourly or even daily, it is done at a security checkpoint or a loading dock usually. Both you and the driver carry pens. A lot of times you use markers for quick box labels or to make changes. I work in construction and I'll bring a Sharpie to deface all the swastikas and what not in the port-a-potty. I once wrote, \"Once I did bad, that I heard ever. Twice I did good, that I heard never.\"I have a stationary aisle in my store. I have had people steal everything from sharpies and glitter glue, to nail polish... and then go in our restrooms with it and write on the wall, floor and sink.\n\n\u0ca0_\u0ca0At work they do, and probablyWe used to have a spot dedicated to \"name your shit after a movie title\" in one stall at workYesIf you have an ass and a finger, you got a pen. (For some people anyway).It's mostly students. I've only really seen bathroom graffiti at schools and places where students hang out. Not premeditated. Many carry markers in their pockets to get a quick tag here and there. Premeditated sometimesIt's kind of premeditated. It's one of those things that when you're leaving the house if you think of it or see it you might stick it in your pocket thinking \"if I see the opportunity I might stamp my tag in something\". I came up with a pretty neat tag a while back but I haven't done that in a long time. I always have a pen and marker on me but only because the culinary field taught me to carry one at all times.I carry a bag of pens, markers, pencils and things. .. maybe I'm alone. Maybe I'm the last latrinalia artiste.Worked in bars and clubs for years. People who graffiti toilets carry their markers everywhere so in that sense it's premeditated. On particular nights - think grime, drum and bass, trap, dubsteb, hiphop - security are instructed to search everyone for marker pens. I always carried a pen......\n.........................................\n.........................................\nis.I personally do have one. I sometimes need to write on whiteboards or plots, so I carry a blue, red and black permanent marker with meI always have a piece of paper or two, a pen and a marker in my pocket. It's still considered to be a necessity to look like a gentleman from where i am. Definitely premeditated defacing I can tell you from experience most of the time is opportunity, but once in a while it's premeditated.I don't know it bathroom stall graffiti is premeditated, or if it just kind of happens when your in there...I think, maybe bothI began carrying markers on me just to do that. I got a good laugh at some of the shit people came up with. I carry a Sharpie religiously...  Not exclusively for writing on walls but they are pretty good at it. When I was in grade school I used to take a straw and napkin to the bathroom with me and shoot spitballs from the third floor window. That was premeditated. Not sure if this helpsSchools, airports, any type of public transportation... most people have some type of backpack or bag that would most likely have a penI still do that. It's really useful, and fun to graffiti when you have a opportunity.I always figured that those people had bags or backpacks with them. Certainly a pen, if you are/were working. I used to carry a pen and notepad but I was trying to be a writer. And for awhile I would write the same thing in every bathroom at school, so I guess at that point it was premeditated. I carry around a pen. You never know when you might need to sign a waver or something.i had a smartphone back in 2010 when i was an art college delinquent and the sharpies were definitely premeditatedIt\u2019s premeditated. I have a friend who is a graffiti artist. He\u2019s amazing but has no self control. \nHe carries sharpies and slaps. \nHe\u2019s 35. \nI mean, I carry pens wherever I go but I have no urge to write or draw on bathroom walls or public spaces, he does. Can\u2019t help it, he\u2019s been arrested a few times because of it. On work days I always have a Sharpie in my pocket.Idk about other ppl but I like drawing and would have sharpies, paint pens, and pencils with me always.I work at a place where a Sharpie is part of the uniform. Our stalls are wrecked. However, one time I wrote the first line of Bohemian Rhapsody on the wall. A few days later, I noticed that other people added the next lines. After about a month, the entire song was written on the wall with about 20 different handwriting lines and various colors of marker. I used to do graffiti when I was younger, it was common for me to have fine tipped and wide tipped markers in my bag at all times. I used On The Run markers for my wide tipped pens  and I could squeeze it to get some awesome drips when I taggedAs a keen bathroom graffiti artist, I always have pens in my bag. I always have one on me in case I have to pee in a bit of strange. When I was in college, I'd usually have a pen in my pocket. The glory holes in every single public restroom sometimes has a pen or pencil or knife in them. You never check? BothI work in a kitchen and use a sharpie every day for writing on tickets and labels. The bathroom stalls in the bars after work are where the real graffiti magic happensIn my area a ton of people did it. They always had it on them, they have these little names they go by and write it everywhere. If someone has the same name usually they\u2019ll fight for it. Was in Seattle recently and a guy outside a club was worried about getting in because he had a marker pen. Seemed premeditated to meA little of both. As a proud vandal, I never leave my home without a streaker, a mop(bleed marker), a scribe, and sometimes a spray can. Please don't judge me/us, as we are providing jobs for city workers. \u270c\ud83c\udffd I found(graffity) what was obviously made whit nail polish, in guys bathroom, so....That sounds like a really cool appHa sounds creepyThat would be a useful app to mark down the locations of gloryholesr/lightbulb\n\ni\u2019d use the fuck out of that app So it's like Pokemon Go, except for lewd comments about people's mothers. This has potential.That\u2019s definitely achievable. With AR it could easily be done. I don\u2019t know if apple has allowed developers to lock GPS locations of AR input. I put this in r/CrazyIdeas a while ago and it never got traction :(I think someone did it in Australia. You can draw anywhere and other people can see it thru their phone. It is AR technology thingy. Unfortunately, the first thing people draw was a penis.Let's see here...app store. Download. Install. Open. Register. Verify. Skip intro. Get started. ...loading... Hitler fucked *my* mom?! Why, you little shit! They should put up whiteboards walls in the stalls.\n\nPeople would need to bring their own markers, since no one would want to touch a shared one, and they would get stolen anyway.\n\nAlso, there *will* be a prick who uses a permanent marker.Now , that's an use case of AR.http://soapstone.io/I think I may only love this idea due to the fact that I\u2019m typing this in a public stall right now.But phones dramatically increase shitposts?And graffiti is done neither for acclaim nor money so it's one of the purest forms of art.  You could say shitposting is a art.As in posts while shitting?The real shower thought is always in the comments.You need to selfpost this asapThats quite thought-provoking actually lolWhoa. That could have also been a shower thought. You can't be banned from a wallExactly! Toilet graffiti or Reddit.....shitposts will be read while in the toilet anyway. Looking for a good time?  Call MasterofDruss' mom!Have you ever seen a glory hole in a public restroom?Usually when the phone dies it's sign to leave the restroom but if there would be charger then you wouldn't even leave it?I'd feel safer sticking my dick in a glory hole than using a usb port in a cubicle People would still try to put their dick into it.\nPeople try to put their dick into lots of things.Imagine the spyware those will download onto your lhone.  It's already a bad idea to use chargers built at malls and shops, a bathroom is about as bad an idea as you can get.did you add them on snap thoughWhat about the dicks? Lol it\u2019s like when I was young and just starting to learn swear words, I would write them eeeeverywheeree. Also around the house. Mom was not pleased when she lifted one of those plate mats only to see FUCK half written/half etched into the table.Humans have been doing bathroom graffiti for thousands of years, we've found bathroom graffiti in Pompeii, for example. If smartphones actually do end the practice it really will be the end of a cultural era.a stephen king book i read was about a traveling salesman that studied and jotted down all the bathroom graffiti he encountered. [removed]Can confirm no cell phone allowed in the building, and we get memos about people smearing shit on the walls.Here I sit \n\nSad and defeated\n\nTried to shit \n\nBut only Tweeted You tried. #whodrewthedickscame here for this comment!\u00d2w\u00d3 I'd like to see some fucking shitty art \nFlush those shitbrick smarties down \nDoes anybody understand, fuck \nThings everything r/publicshowerthoughtsReduction in boredom[deleted]Ha sorry man i had no idea have an upvoteThere\u2019s an optimum time to post things to reddit.

And as long as you\u2018re not using your wiping hand for swiping it can\u2018t be that bad.\n\nDon\u2018t wipe and swipe.You\u2019re weird dude.Are the sort of people organised enough to carry a pen and notepad the same sort of people who would graffiti a toilet door?[deleted]You mean reporters in the 70\u2019s?We need toilets with displays as walls, so my stylus/s-pen/iPencil/whatever can write on itI still find carrying a pen and pad easier. I feel less likely to write things down on the phone for some reason. Pen feels more organic/creative.People are redditing on their preferred hate subs, rather than expressing it to future toilet users.In south Florida I see \u201cVisah\u201d and \u201cGot Milf?\u201d Stickers in every other bathroom stall and every other street sign.I definitely used to carry a sharpie for graffiti purposes.not a knife, diamond tipped etcher>Man. That's defecation.\n\nFixed it for you.I referred to that as my \"Good clubbing Sharpie\" in case I needed to get or give out a number. Aww the early 2000s. How would the odd numbered people know if the next move was X or O? Today I thought about graffiti-ing youThe worst feelingYep! Can someone make this? An augmented reality app where you can shitpost IRLSony tried exactly that with TAG for PS Vita, quite a forgotten application.Some people must carry a toolbox around to make those. Of course it's got to be a penis. Most permanent markers are alcohol based, so rubbing alcohol should remove it easily. Another trick is just drawing over the permanent marks with a regular dry erase marker, then wipe awayThe grafitti moved from toilets to the internet  *shit*posts or *shitposts*?There\u2019s definitely some rep based reasons folks do itThat meta touch to that shower thought is the bad grammar in the last sentence. Perfecto.Well you can be banned from visiting that wall for starters*Mods didn't like that*You have been banned from /r/wallTell that to the MongoliansTell that to East Berlin US says otherwiseDepends on who built said wall.Last gas stop in western Mass on the mass pike before entering New York.

Have faith in humanity.\n\n\nEDIT: Wow humanity keeps on giving, thanks for the gold!I'm honestly a little upset I've never seen oneIt's glorious.I've seen holes between stalls at the proper location for the deed, but nothing big enough to get my dick through, let alone comfortably. Absolutely.

Carrying a purse makes it easier to have a lot of potentially useful crap around at all times. \n\nIt's also really easy to accidentally walk off with someone else's penYou'd be surprised what boredom in a bathroom stall does to even the most noble of men.True for me. I like to think of myself as a graffiti fixer though... e.g. turned a 'vote NO' (re gay marriage equality) on wall into a giant 'vote nitrous oxide' by adding the bond and electrons.Boredom will do a number on a person.  I once killed a guy when I was 13 and my parents grounded me for a week with no TV. I use sharpies at work so I often catch myself with one even when outside of work I would think the people who would graffiti the door would carry the marker just with the very purpose of writing on the doors/wallsI keep all of my school pencils/pens in my pocket. I don\u2019t have a pencil case. I\u2019ve never graffitied a bathroom, but I could have now that I think about it.So all non organised pepole do grafitti?Everybody poops. Everybody gets constipated. Everybody gets bored on the pot.Yes. Okay, maybe not notepads, but having a pen in your pocket was pretty darn common back in the day. >I think every plant I have been to always has a name your shit after a movie list in at least one stall.\n\nSee, I'm curious enough to want a picture, but that requires a phone, and the lack of phone contributes to the lists existence \n\nSeriously, lots of people carried them. It'd be strange not to, because how else could you get a person's phone number, keep phone numbers with you, remember to pick something up, keep a schedule, etc?\n\nMy dad still does, in fact, despite owning a smart phone. At this point, it's just habit.Shit is being expressed two different ways at the same time?Is there a number to call if you have got Milf?Have goals.Visah is a graffiti artist.

I mean I carry a purse but... related note, knew of at least one bar that had tiny tvs above the urinals. Noticeable reduction in graffiti, bathroom rights, and general jackassery by putting something in there to distract people's attention. \n\nAlternate tactic: know of a few bars that just redirected it.  They paint the whole top half of their bathroom walls in blackboard paint and put chalk out. Magic marker on real walls looks shitty and trashy, but intentionally turn your walls into a chalkboard, it comes off \"fun\" and \"trendy\" plus the graffiti is non destructive and easily removed.Did you know shampoo contains sodium Lauryl sulfate?I turned Kill Rapists into Kill Baptists one afternoon so I knew it would be cleaned up right away - on beautiful stone columns in city park  gazebo[deleted]Paul Walker approvesWhoa, that's fucked up.\n\nA whole week without TV...I think you are supposed to supply the number to those who want milfI believe that [Artopia](https://paintwithartopia.com) is what your talking about\n\nEdit: don\u2019t remember how to do links \n\nEdit2: thanks to u/OwenProGolfer for the formatting stuffIs it Just A Line?\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17144194/google-ar-just-a-line-app-white-lines-paint-air](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17144194/google-ar-just-a-line-app-white-lines-paint-air)I think I might have [found it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-brush/id1277410449?mt=8)This sounds like something Barney Stinson would say.In Thaddeus we trust.

    "Comments": " ads on tv that have campfire scenes annoy me because they have this small fire and they put on this giant log like no that\u2019s not going to helpIn an episode of scooby-doo when they are at a camp, I believe on a boat or something, the smoke kept blowing into Shaggy's face no matter where he moved.And it does that because the wind can't come through you, so the movement of the air is from all the other directions, but yours.  You literally make a little windbreak area of low pressure just in front of yourself, basically.  \n\n\nStop trying to escape it, sit further back or make your fire less smokey to begin with.Someone telling a great story while in the background the comic relief keeps switching spots to avoid the smokeYou also almost never see someone taking a shit in movies. \n\nIt's almost as if movies depict a romanticised and perfected version of reality huh.That's why they always have someone better looking off cameraFinally someone is talking about the *real* problem with Star Trek V.My cousins and stuff used to say the smoke blew towards the most beautiful in the group when we got together for family stuff. So we'd be like \"being beautiful is such a pain\" as we tried to not beathe in smoke. My grandma always complained about how it was in her area, and one time this girl that was a friend of my cousin came and complained about it in her face and did the whole \"beautiful thing\" and I told her that it always blew towards grandma. She turned around and guess who was there? That girl was so stunned and a little scared of my grandma all night.somebody told me the term white rabbit (a phrase for smoke following you) had to do with native americans observing the white man hop around the fire to diffrent spots like rabbits.\"I hate rabbits\"\n\n\n anyone else?Propane is a clean burning gas tell you whatThey don't forget, they intentionally don't show it because it's not interesting.Whoever is off camera is getting a face full of smokeThat\u2019s because we use propane. Not only for safety, but controllability. It can be shut off for breaks and between takes. Also, because many scenes are filmed on sound stages and we couldn\u2019t combust another material without causing several health and hazard issues.Any other boy scouts feel this one on a personal level?I was always told the smoke follows the most attractive person, turns out I was just the fattest one around the fire.[You've had this extra pair of gloves this whole time?](https://makeagif.com/gif/dumb-and-dumber-extra-gloves-hd-Xlcf-D)White rabbit, white rabbit!When it randomly pops and sends embers up and everyone kinda jumpsShifts seat to get out of the smoke. Smoke turns and goes straight to my faceMy grammy always said that smoke follows beauty.  ;)And they never seem to have someone that throws a massive fuck-off log into the fire so that there's an eruption of embers that causes at least one person to almost set on fire.Ive never thought of that.Smoke follows a fool.Many many campfires. The \u201cI hate white rabbits\u201d approach only serves to give you something to do while your eyes tear up and local rabbits\u2019 feelings get hurt.I recently read an interview with Tantoo Cardinal, an actress who has appeared on camera in plenty of 'campfire scenes'. They're all done with propane burners. I imagine this is for safety, convenience, and continuity's sake. She said she has had to act in lots of historical dramas while speaking one of many North American aboriginal languages, and breathing in the smell of propane.That's because they are chanting \"I like dead rabbits\"Years ago, my family had a bonfire in my back yard. My cousin, who I always looked up to, taught my family a trick. If the smoke is blowing in your face, say \"white rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbit.\" And I shit you not, the smoke will move to another direction. It's always worked for me, it might work for any of you.Or the smell the next day, maybe I associate it with hangovers but ugh..the smellCan't forget that someone has to say, \"Smoke follows beauty\"It\u2019s like in a car chase scene, when the car is going really really fast with the windows down, and there seems to be no wind at all in the car at all. Shit would be blowing around everywhere!I knew those campfire scenes never looked right to me but I could never figure out whyMy brother tends to say: \u201dthe smoke follows the sheep f***er\u201d. But usually only when it follows me. I find it disturbing.Had a couple of Russian exchange students over the summer. We did a campfire and they had never seen Marshmallows in person. They thought that people were roasting potatoes on sticks in movies and tv shows.Campfire smoke follows you everywhereI heard that in order to keep smoke out of your face you should try to make the fire as hot as possible, that way not only do you feel the heat while sitting farther away but also the higher heat make the smoke rise out of the way faster. Is this true?campfires don't have bbq, only smores...that's annoyingWhite rabbit white rabbit white rabbitThe best part of the camp fire is feeling sleepy because of the C02I hate white rabbitsWhite rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbit!They usually use natural gas so there's no smoke anyway.That shit happens in real lifei wonder how do they deal with this problem when they film itAfter reading this, I will make sure to add such stuff to any campfire scenes I put in my movies (if I ever make a movie).And there\u2019s always too much light!They just know how to make a hot fire.All you have to do is yell \"taco\" loudly at the smoke to scare it off. This family trick works 100% of the time 25% of the time.That or the people doing these scenes have never been camping.\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude06 super true\"I hate dead rabbits\"\"I'm so proud of this community\"Relevant Oatmeal!\n\nhttps://www.theoatmeal.com/comics/campfireOn it chief.So just like in real life then, huh?Anyone else say \"I hate white rabbits\" to make the smoke go away or is that just a weird thing around where I'm from?As a Boy Scout who has done over 40 nights of camping in total, I can confirm. It seems like no matter what wherever you move the smoke will go into your faceThe Youtube RewindThe breeze blowing past you creates a vacuum that pulls the smoke in. Just like driving an SUV with the rear door open will kill you from CO poisoning.\ud83e\uddd0 hmmm ur right.Or there\u2019s no annoying wind. \n\n**BOOM**I was once in a scene with a campfire and it actually took a really long time because we had to stop filming all the time because of smoke in our facesObviously they dont know of the \"I hate rabbits\" trick.Haven't you been to a campfire before? That's real life, bro.Some friends of mine have a fire pit in their backyard. It annoyingly blows in my face no matter where I move when I'm visiting them, in their backyard and they have it going.Same thing with smokers who wear glasses. What about when the smoke gets trapped between your face and glasses and makes your eyes water?Just repeatedly say \"I hate rabbits\" at it. I have no idea why, but my scout troop did it to push the smoke in another direction... and it workedIt probably happens, they just cut it outAlso people never stop to poop in moviesI hate white rabbits too.mY eYeS it BurNsThen the phenomenon where somebody's marshmallow catches fire, they panic and flip it, it flies off the stick and it lands on my lap.I hate white rabbits! I hate white rabbits! i hate white rabbi.... FUCK OFF SMOKE!!!!!! ARGGHHH I HATE WHITE RABBITS!!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-me every timeYay. Smokes follows beauty!\"If you don't appreciate the smell of the smoke, you haven't been outside long enough\"So vary realisticI'm so proud of this communitySomething I never thought of but now I can't stop thinking about.Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society.I hadn't thought of that before, but you're right.This is true.... That\u2019s how you know they ain\u2019t doing it in real lifeMost use gas fires to eliminate the production of smokeWait, are you not using smokeless wood in your campfires?They have fans.This happens in real life at every campfire I've ever sat aroundHave you ever noticed that it only follows some people though? Like, smoke loves me, I'll see it harrasing someone and than I'll get near the fire on the other side and BAM it starts to follow me. Shits weird.It\u2019s like the smoke knows where I move and annoys me because smoke hates meand no one coughs, right?They didn\u2019t say \u201cfuzzy bunny\u201d to make it moveWhy does that happen?White bunny, white bunny, white bunnyAlso the next 4 hours of being casually drunk and wanting to shower cause you smell like campfire smoke.And there\u2019s always that one person that the smoke completely avoids and you swap places with them and the smoke follows you.I hate rabbits.Good thing I have a wife, it follows those things everywhere.*smoke blows face\n\n\"WHY JESUS!? WHY DO YOU TEST ME SO!!???\"And how about how they never take shit, would be so much more realistic if you had to wait for characters to take shit and eat breakfast etc. HAHA genius op.Positive and negative ions.But, I like camp smoke.I guess I never noticed this, I\u2019m going to have to remember to pay attention to that from now on. \ud83d\ude05All that means is you chose the wrong wood, or the wrong seat. Also- the hotter the better babyyyIt\u2019s usually a gas fireThat would be really annoying to the viewer and not add to most scenes unless they are meant to be comical.Not just in movies but in real life as wellAnd then doing that recovery squat when you can\u2019t see anything and have to let your eyes water.There isn\u2019t smoke if the fire is hot enough\u201cWhite Rabbit!\u201d Or am I the only one who does this? Idk what voodoo rules it follows but for some reason the smoke moves away from me.Hey guys white rabbitIt\u2019s almost as if the fire was made JUST to inconvenience youDead rabbit dead rabbit dead rabbit dead rabbitSmoke follows beautyAt scout camp, my troop always has someone read The Cremation of Sam McGee, which is a long poem by Robert Service. I usually read it because I can project well. One time the smoke was so bad I choked up and tears were streaming from my eyes about about halfway through. I had to ask my friend to finish it for me. He choked in about thirty seconds. Another scout finished it. No matter where we stood, the smoke seemed to be in our faces, because the audience was facing away from the bay and into the campsite, with the speaker facing the opposite way. The evening wind was coming off the water and pushed the smoke toward us.*smells of smoke*\n\nIt always blows at the uglies person.Yeah well maybe they've mastered the art of saying \"I love dead rabbits\" three times that now they're subconscious is able to do it on its ownThere's usually a fan directly above the fire to suck the smoke straight upHow about in Spongebob when he\u2019s singing the Campfire Song Song?This happens to me EVERY TIME. It\u2019s a running joke in my family. Nobody will sit near me at a campfire, because they know the smoke will be blowing that way.Not for nothing, but why the fuck would this be desirable in a scene is all I'm saying ...I always forget this when I have a fire, then halfway through when I\u2019m coughing, smell like smoke and my eyes are burning I\u2019m like why did I do this?And you're always hot on one side and freezing on the otherMy top 3 campfire scenes from cinema: 1) Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, 2) Short Circuit, 3) Almost HeroesLet\u2019s gather round the campfire and sing our cough* cough* campfire cough* songIt does, trust means. We just shot a campfire scene last night and the actress did her lines and cried each time iatse the smoke was in her face. It kept moving in and out and her lines were short but you can't see that on camera, we just don't mention it because it's not relevant.The magic words are \"I hate jackrabbits\"Yeah, they also forget that it gets on your hair and clothes and you can never ever get rid off it.Yeah, wtf...I like to do the Wim Hoff Method while sitting by the fire. Naturally, I use only green wood.There's also a frustrating lack of sea bears.Where I live, if someone has that happen to them, you mock them saying something like, \"it's because you piss on the road\" :D\n\nWonder if there's anything similar around the world.I hate white rabbits!I need a comedy movie with this now99.95% of On-screen fires are propane-fueled for control.Annoyingly accurateThere's a saying in Nepali, If you pee on the road smoke will always blow in your face \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f\ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01White rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbitHow does the smoke always blow into every single person face at a fire no matter where they move\n\nIt feels like it should be impossible by some law of physicsThat\u2019s why YouTube Rewind got so many dislikes.OP campsI was JUST thinking of this HOURS ago!! Was going to make a vent post lmao. I lit up the grill and every god damn time the wind changed and i moved, it *followed* me!Haha, but nice try, in spongebob the writers were smart to leave the smoke out because smoke doesn\u2019t exist underwaterI can't believe it's not just me. I thought the smoke just made it its job to find my face.My dad always says: \u201csmoke follows the fool\u201dI hate rabbits.White rabbit white rabbit white rabbitI hate white bunny rabbits.Rabbits!In Friday the 13th it didn't matter if that happened, Jason Voorhees has a mask AND the victim got utterly rekt by getting hit against a tree while in a sleeping bag.I can definitely imagine this being put into a Tarantino film where the characters spend a long time shuffling around cursefully complaining all the whileAnd urn the fuck at of your eyes in the processWhen I was I kid my mom always told me that the smoke is just always naturally attracted to you and for the longest time I believed her. Now I realize how dumb it really soundsDuh all they would havta do is write in the script for the character to say \"white rabbit!\".Smoke follows the ugly.But smoke follows the ugly. And since no Hollywood actors are ugly, it has nowhere to go but up.Ugh the worst!Welcome to every campfire I've ever sat around in real life.\u201cNature would never do this to me!\u201d\n\nWished every camper ever.My grandma always told me smoke from a fire follows the most attractive personNow that you mentioned it, I can't get the thought out of my head. How many movies/shows/commercial have I seen where no one was reacting to the smokeThis reminds me of when my family and I were hanging out around the firepit in our backyard one night. The smoke kept blowing into my face, so I moved...and it followed me, no matter what spot I went to. My parents got a good laugh out of it.White rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbit ... Three times to banish the beast, I'm sure they hurt extras to mutter it behind the actorsSmoke follows beauty.This is like a shitty b rated super hero origin storyIt means your beautifulSomeone once told me fire literally follows people around because when they get up and move locations they create a low pressure zone and that causes the smoke to aim at them, so usually when the smoke is blowing in my direction I just sit still, someone else moves and the smoke more or less leaves me, if it\u2019s not a windy night, it actually works! Everyone else is playing musical chairs while I can focus on making the perfect s\u2019moreYou\u2019re bad at making fires.Just build a better fireBecause if you see a campfire scene like that in a movie you will be like ahaha that\u2019s so relatable and that\u2019s just gonna break the eerie campfire moodI Go To Camp Yearly And A There Is A Campfire About 6 Times And Suprisingly This Only Happened Once.. HmmWhen I was 5, my uncle, who was starting up the BBQ grill, told me, \"Smoke follows ugly people.\" Scarred me for years as I never wanted to be near the grill or campfire.I always say \"The smoke follows the fool, \" usually when the smoke is in my faceAlso how do they get so close?In cud scouts we have an expression \" I hate wight rabbits\" which means please god don't blow smoke in my face, I am to young to die.[deleted]Reddit finds the most innovative ways to get annoyedBut the opposite is true in movies. They've got like 12 baby sticks and nothing else and all a sudden it's a bonfire with no additional fuel needed.I love how it\u2019s either this dink ass little fire and they are placing logs on it, or they have an armload and it\u2019s 15 foot fire.I was on a movie set with a campfire in the scene. \n\nThe logs are setting on top of a gas line. The logs are engulfed in flames only while filming. They are extinguished as soon as the director call \u201ccut\u201d.Is that... Not how you do it?...How did this post pop off so much!It's almost like they weren't advertising campfires!This guy campsAdd some petrol (gasoline) and it don\u2019t matter how small the fire is, that log will burn \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25That\u2019s what I thought reading OP\u2019s shower thought. The exception is when that\u2019s the gag.It was fucking Freds face you poser![deleted]Link?He always has smoke in his face anywaysShaggy wouldn't even notice smoke being blown into his face.He did that only using 0.0001% of his powerLink?I thought it was FredI think you meant that the entire earth around Shaggy was smoking from him containing his power, so there was no place he could move that smoke wasn\u2019t there.How funny. That also happens to me when I'm near a campfire.The fire aims the smoke at the most powerful person nearby, of course.Yes.. the smoke.. from the fire \ud83d\ude0bI laughed reading this and remembering the scene.Put a better wind break some where else you say.>Stop trying to escape it, sit further back or make your fire less smokey to begin with.\n\nThis is why we use seasoned dry wood for our fires. Stuffs pretty cheap around me, you can get a rick of it for about 100 bucks including deliveryMy experience with fire smokiness:\n\nLeast smoky fire: charcoal \n\nMedium: dry wood, sticks\n\nMedium high: fresh wood, sticks, dry leaves\n\nHigh: paper, less dry leaves\n\nSuper high: fresh leaves, fresh wood with plenty of tree sapThis would make a great comedy scene, where each character attempts to speak their lines, but instead begins coughing from from the smoke. Goes nowhere. Blazing Saddles without farts.[removed]Right, this is why campground firepits usually have a tall, flat rock at the back of the ring. It draws the smoke to it instead of the people around the fireI'm sure all your mums are lovely people.So what if you sat parallel to the wind, and had someone also sitting parallel on the other side. Would it equalize the pressure to an extent, making the smoke go straight upIt's not so much the wind as it is just a normal chimney effect. Even on a perfectly still day the smoke will still follow you, because it draws in air from it's surroundings.Going to give this a try; thanks for the advice kind stranger.And since you are warmer air will convect up your frontside. If you stack one side of the for ring much higher then the fire will better tend to stick to the fire ring.Make the fire bigger. A strong updraft takes the smoke up vertically instead of wafting around.  Thats what i do when burning wet or slighly geen wood i collect from the area.I was hoping to find an explanation in this thread. Thanks! I'm glad I'm not just imagining things.So it happens to the bigger people more?OK, but why does it just follow me when there are like 5 or 6 people? And no, no Finnish responses.The Bernoulli Effect, yea?Besides a gas fire pit, how does one minimize a fire\u2019s smokeynessMaking the fire less Smokey is the real LPT.Whoa. That\u2019s neat!Every time the shot changes to someone else's face he's sitting next to them, too just trying wave it awayThere's just no wind left to blow the smoke...anime characters hogging all of it so their hair is perpetually flutteringAnd the story being told is Gone By the WindSeriously! I want to know how the three sea shells work![deleted]Don't know about you, but my \"romanticised and perfected version of reality\" involves lots of people taking shits.Nothing like digging in the woods to take a dump.More like, you have limited screen time and have to make good use of it. Very little of a movie shouldn't give you new information unless it's there for emphasis or added effect.\n\nHaving people do mundane things we assume they do and don't need to see would add too much time and break the action.\n\nIt's less about romanticization and more about practicality/executionJurassic park 1 \n\nTrex just noms a guy on the shitterFriday. \u201cDon\u2019t nobody go in there for 25 to 35 minutes\u201dWhite chicksPulp Fiction centers around people taking shits at inopportune times.So out of breaking all of Star Trek with insane travel times, Spock's Brother, a planet of intergalactic peace, Spock catching Kirk falling off a mountain, and then God, you think Spock, Kirk and Bones eating beans and singing Row Row Row Your Boat is the biggest problem?Yep. \u201cSmokes follows beauty\u201d. Heard that every time my church youth group had a bonfireI always heard that it blows towards the stupid personIn Finland it's \"the smoke follows the one who fucks a sheep\"My grandma always said this too \u2764\ufe0fI'd call bologna on this one.  It's not like white people at the time of first contact had never had experience sitting around a campfire...\u201cWhite rabbit, white rabbit, white rabbit\u201d will keep the smoke from blowing in your face. Along with not sitting in the direction the wind is blowing.\u201cI hate white rabbits\u201dI\u2019ve always heard this around campfires since I was about 13 or so years old. Every time I tell someone about it they look at me like i have three god damn heads. Jokes on them though because the smoke doesn\u2019t follow me.We stated \"White rabbit\" and then hand slashed at the smoke.This takes me back dude! It always worked for me idk how or why.\u201cThat is the most foul, cruel, bad-tempered rabbit you\u2019ve ever seen\u201dI kill demons because they killed my rabbit.I\u2019ve always said \u201cbrown bear\u201dI still say this without even breaking conversation. It's a fun mini game to see who catches it/who's never heard me say it before. \n\nDon't remember who taught me this originally, but I've never met anyone else irl who says it. You are neat.We say \"fuck you smoke bitch\"\"Dead rabbit, dead rabbit, dead rabbit...\" until the smoke moved.[deleted]Were they disappointed that they didn't get to eat roast potatoes on sticks?Yes, they tend to only stop their rampages via holy grenadeNatural gas + fake logs I assume.Yeah, I'll be damned if the fire I'm tending is smokey.Smoke follows beauty.Which is perfectly accurate with 99% of the people I've ever gone camping with.Paper (or something similar) burns twigs, which burns sticks, which burns branches, which burns logs.So the ad is pretty accurate for me personallyFound the boyscoutTo be fair, a proper fire will make lighting the scene for anything but a moody night scene problematic.I can\u2019t get my charcoal grill to stay lit even when using lighter fluid and matches, meanwhile Bear Grylls can start a roaring fire in 5 minutes using a cup of piss and his pubes.Log cabin style or gtfomy level 99 firemaking says otherwiseI went camping with some city folks once.  I was setting up my tent or something and noticed them trying to build a camp fire.    \n\n\nThis camp fire consisted of one log about a half meter thick, and one quart of motor oil.\"Pushing the bounds of mild irritation since 2005[\"](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)Or indoors in castles, they act like maintaining the roaring fire in the bedroom wouldn\u2019t require a servant to come tend it like every 10 minutes.Something tells me that Shaggy, like that 70s show gang, doesn't mind the smoke.It's kinda like wondering why characters never just sneeze or trip for no reason just because that's how life goes. They only do if it's relevant to the gag or plot.And it was the camp scare movie smhThat's a little graphic for scooby doo.Did Fred consent to said face fucking?Yeah, Scooby-Doo is awesome.Your mom is already the best wind break.Like maybe some stones, and then further back a nice stack of logs to keep the heat in.  Something to direct the smoke away, and something overhead to hold the heat in more and keep you dry if it rains.  You don't want to be totally isolated from nature though, so maybe have some holes in the log barrier, and of course a way to get in and out.  This seems familiar, but I'm not quite sure if I can put my finger on it.  Maybe some syrup will help.>get a rick of it\n\nWhat kind of measure is a rick? Honest question.[removed]> This is why we use seasoned dry wood for our fires.\n\nThat sounds so hipster lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBb9O-aW4zII\u2019m not used to rick measurement because 1/3 of a cord does not last long.I'd prefer to woodwork with stuff that dry, but each to their own.Damn.  That's a lot.  I used to get it for $85 a cord!Most of the time when I build campfires, it's with downed sticks and branches, but the main logs are treated wood. Still smoky as shit.\n\nMight try adding charcoal to the mix this year.Super super high: An evergreen branchSuper super high:  scrap particle board with plastic veneer.  Which some guy won't let anyone take off the fire.  Stubbornly insisting it will burn.It just needs to be hot. Smoke comes from uncombusted material. \n\nYou control heat by controlling the rate of reaction. This means building heat before throwing the big log on. Reaction speed is also proportional to the surface area of the pieces you're using. You get more surface area out of small pieces. \n\nAlso, if there is water present any heat you generate will go to evaporating water instead of gasifying the cellulose.Charcoal is the least smokey solely because there's nothing left to give off smoke. It's pretty neat.Smoldering SaddlesThat's just SaddlesI mean... They silenced all the farts in the original TV release so it's kind of like that.  Just a bunch of dudes scraping metal plates and horking down beans. Sounds kind of like coughing.\n\nEDIT:  Here, found it.  It was [shown in the documentary for the movie](https://youtu.be/1PdukDKUcE0?t=1477).Man that is some Rolf shit.  \"As they say in home country, smoke follows the goat-fucker, Ed-boy!\"In the US, it's common to say smoke follows beauty.   Of course only the person shuffling around the fire pit will say itWait what?? This just blew my mind.Wait can you explain further? So when I\u2019m building a campfire, I should just find a big rock and put it in the fire ring next to the wood?Not mineMine is dead. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fHaha, he doesn't know how to use the three seashells!!My favourite guess is scrape/spray/blow.PulpfictionHe wasn\u2019t taking a shit. He ran in the stall to hideThere are movies of that too.Movies with unrealistic campfire scenes are literally unwatchable!Smoke follows stupidwell to my understanding native used raised fire pits so the smoke would go over their heads when seated. the white man did not. however this is all stories and i can't verify it.Not defending the white rabbit info, but weren't they sailors from a city? Sure a lot of them probably camped too, but compare that chance to the average native. Or amount of time camping. \n\nAlso, is it possible that the hopping wasn't necessarily due to inexperience? \n\nJust questions. It still very well could make no sense.White people, during their time of first contact with natives, have sat around fires with natives prior to making first contact?Well since the settlers were usually sailors from cities they aren't used to sitting at a campfire constantly. The natives spend their whole lives sitting by a campfire at night so the smoke wouldn't bother them as muchIt's been a while since I've been around a campfire.I used to sneak up behind my sister and whisper \"You love brown hares\" and she would get angry at me because she thought that meant the smoke would blow her way[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)Relatable isn't inherently interesting because you already experience it.I've always been the fire master, mostly because everyone else fucking sucks at fire.That's sad. Building a fire is my favorite part of camping! Once you take a second and understand how to do it, it's easy!I found myself to be the only \"hippy\" in my group of 20+ that knew how to build and maintain a fire.  It was surprising as I thought that was a basic human skill.  I guess boy scouts came in handy after all...\n\nI don't know what they would have done it I hadn't gone camping.  How do you fail to start a fire when you have a lighter and liquor?So are you a teepee or a log house structure campfire master?[deleted]My family rolled in and burned up three days of wood in a couple of hours because \"where's the flames?\" I chopped that wood with a little hatchet. Then they burned my heat wall when they ran out of wood. They left food all over the site and attracted many raccoons, which didn't affect them as they slept in a car and watched movies on their laptop.\n\nSome people aren't cut out for camping.[deleted]cabin... where we're going there are no cabins... only rain and wind...There's a difference between reality and computer games... e.g. that I'm able to make top tier armor in Skyrim doesn't mean that I'm a proficient armorer in reality.Some of my friends and I assisted some Icelandic scouts that were travelling here once (a long time ago)... they were somewhere around 15 people and had only brought ONE gas-fueld Trangia cooker for the group to cook on and if I remember correctly, they didn't really know how to use it. We were older teenagers at the time and we could tell they were struggling to survive at the local campsite and we offered them our Scouthall to stay in instead. Then we informed the higher ups of our decision and when they were told about these being \"indoor scouts\" they agreed with letting them stay for little to no charge (we usually charge a nominal fee if scouts want to rent our hall for a week/weekend - non scouts get the full price).\n\nFurther I'd like to add that our decision had nothing to do with taking pity on them or anything - we noticed that they could do with some help and then offered to let them stay. We also took them on a short 10 KM hike and most of them did really well on that.Took me 7 tries to click that on mobile.

It's incredibly toxic to the air and ground and even illegal in some counties.  Might want to get your lungs checked out!Charcoal is excellent for getting that internal, base layer to where you want it. It helps keep the fire going and burning everything you put in it. \n\nSource: eagle scout who's camped too damn much.You need to use dry materials and build heat before you put wet stuff on. \n\nIf it's smokey you can experiment wirh smaller \"flash fuels\", ie small stuff that burns hot. You also need to balance how much air it's getting. Creating an upward draft is hoghly effective so I recommend building a lincoln log structure.That\u2019s like throwing fucking tires on the fire, it\u2019s only useful if you are trying to draw attention to you via smoke.I coughed out a large mouthful of delicious tuna salad trying to laugh at your comment. >:|Great.I think I might have just solved our firewood problem.What a fucking savage!Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery[deleted]I can't find anything about the raised fire pits. Not calling BS or anything, I was just interested in seeing drawings or pictures or something. Got anything by any chance?White man. Can verify we suck at sitting around fires.Natives were not a single culture.  The way Seminoles built fires was not the same as the Comanche, etc.  They didn't all live in igloos or teepees and hunt buffalo.  They were a wide range of different cultures with separate methods to survive in their environments.  \nEdit spelling.Seems like the fire would be cooler then.Not directed at you specifically, just taking the presented opportunity-\nIt\u2019s important to remember that Native American culture isn\u2019t monolithic and varies widely between tribesNo they infer that it was inexperience around campfires that made them move around to avoid the smoke.>Engineer\n\nChecks out[.](https://imgur.com/cXA7XxW)Yup it's kinda fun at first to go camping with people who have no woodscraft knowledge whatsoever because they make you feel like Bear Grylls but then that second night rolls around and you've done absolutely everything for 40 hours and you just wanna strangle them allBeing fire master is where I feel most useful in life. I love itFirst thing we taught our (now 7yo) on his first camping trip was how to make and maintain a proper fire. Now at any occasion with a fire he steps up and handles the fire when the men mess it up. Awesome to watch every time.That is very convenient, as one is the minimum AND maximum number of fire masters in a camping group.Found CarrieI come from a family of pyromaniacs.I am the Firestarter, twisted Firestarter!Appropriate nameLots of blowing...Starting the fire is easy, what many people have trouble with is keeping the fire going after you lit itThat\u2019s what I meant by something similar.yes. that was the joke. making fire in runescape is nothing like making a fire in real lifeTry baconreader https://i.imgur.com/wDl0urE.jpgWell my phone has a built in stylus, so Ha!

Always fun when drunk and its darkStart with a bunch of tiny little twigs and work your way up from there.Make a little teepee with tinder in the middle and kindling as the walls. Once the kindling walls start to catch, add on bigger and bigger sticks as the fire grows.\n\nEdit: Make sure there is plenty of space in between the sticks for your fire to breathe.Here's a good, detailed explanation. https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-build-a-roaring-campfire/Less is more.Check it: organize your wood in three piles based on diameter (they're called tinder, kindling, and fuel in that order). Don't add a new, larger type of wood until the fire is burning hot and steady on the type that you're on.\n\nYou can mix it up with different lays and stuff but that's all just icing really. Oh and bring lighter fluid \ud83d\ude02. No reason to handicap yourself as a junior firestarter.Even when we were doing mushrooms in the mountains, I was the fire master.I love that your family calls you DrSpaceman.Even if now intentional, I love this 30 rock/Calvin and Hobbes mashup with that name.yeah, i just realized it might be confusing to people who aren't familiar with runescape. making a fire there is dumbed down (and involves some magic), and takes basically no time at all. to get to level 99 in firemaking just requires you to do it an insane amount of timesr/killmenowLmao i had the dvdIt was the lab assistant the whole time!Yall naming off a lot of scooby doo movies.

That shit was damn good.At least she keeps coming back for more though.So a face cordNo this is patrickDamn it Coral!Oh god that's a big responsibility... The forests are so big and there's only one of me...Unrelated, but smokey the bear is the reason we actually have such bad forest fires nowadays. Forests are supposed to burn, but we made everyone think that they weren't and get scared of fire. So now when one finally gets started, there are 20+ years of unburned fuel sitting on the forest floor and it decimates the forest rather than cleaning it.Don't use river rock, it could explodeIn new england people sometimes catch crawfish and toss them on rocks surrounding a fire to cook them.Classic wood hunt while a bit fucked upAnd this is why we get all the wood we need before we build the fire\ud83d\ude02[deleted]more or lessNice. I remember one time i was tripping nuts and had to keep the fire going in the rain. Went through 4 days of wood in the first night and had to get more the next day but the fire never went out and the party kept going.LmaoPffft... \"Had\"I had/have the GBA gameI too want an answer to this.'Cause it's horror time again!Well your mom never leaves.They are speaking the language of the gods.Yeah, I've always heard it called a face cord. The full block is a bush cord or full cordBut then again, who was phone?I wouldn't say smokey in and of himself is the reason, more the mindset the Forest Service had during the past hundred years, but the rest rings true from my wildland firefighting course.Good shit, man. We almost burned the woods down, due to not looking up when choosing a fire pit. We tore it apart and got it to another spot before it went out.\n\nActually pretty proud of that. We moved a fire.> had to\n\nHa, you sure everyone else wasn't just passed out in their tents out of the rain and you were on a personal mission to keep the fire going?The PS1 game I rented once. Was a neat Crash Bandicoot clone.I still have my Scooby Doo SNES game. I've never beaten it to this day.I always thought he was running off with Daphne so they could do the doobie-doo. But reflecting on all my gay friends, it makes since if she was his hag and he was always wanting to get her alone so he could talk about his boy problems... just a theory. Then there\u2019s the ascot.My mom did!It's a rack here, 1/2 cord, full cordNo it\u2019s definitely Smokey the Bear. Ever consider than he was working for the Russians during the Cold War to undermine the US national parks?Thats rad dude. Good job. This was at a smaller festival (3000ppl) and we ended up with a pretty good sized spot on a corner. Had one of the few fires still going the next day.Nope. It was just me and one other person actually camping on our site(my girl n i at the time sleeping in my truck) and since i was the only fire for a few hundred feet everyone just came n hung out.It was so difficult. But one of my favorite N64 games was Scooby Doo Classic Creepy Capers. Needless to say it had all of Scoob and the gang\u2019s best capers.If I remember correctly, the Johnny Bravo crossover basically confirmed they\u2019re sneaking off to fondle each other. Or I just made up a memory of Fred going, \u201c*Daphne...*\u201d and making a face when she didn\u2019t pair them up while splitting up the group, and she corrects it.How old is Fred?You can have her back nowWent to check to see why it was taking your dad so long to buy cigarettes, huh?",

    "Comments": "Not necessarily a better value if the candy hasnt been swapped in 15 years and tastes like shitWhen I was a kid they were nickel and dime machines. Quarters were better stuff and 50 cents got holigrafic stickers.Except for those runts are the same ones from 1994The quantity has dropped quite a bitOnly they have gone up. Most of them I see now are 50 cents, and I've seen 75 cents and 1 dollar as well. On top of some 25 centers. And as someone else has mentioned they used to be as low as a nickel when my parents were younger.Actually, the big gumballs you see inside these things have been subject to \u201cshrink-flation\u201d.\n\nThe gumballs are the same size on the outside, but they are hollow and the walls are thinner than they used to be. Do you see the same thing happening at grocery stores where the cereal box is the same size, but it has only a handful of cereal inside.Ehhhhh. They have the means, the mechanisms, to dispense less candy in the machines that drop a small handful. It's not impossible. And nobody likes medium sized gumballs/jaw breakers.Interesting thought. But I hace noticed most coin machines have hiked up to 50 cents or in some cases 75 cents. They have adjusted for inflation on popular ones for sure, they would go bankrupy otherwise.that's what candy dispenser companies want you to think. This post is sponsoredUsed to be a nickel now it's a quarterThere was a Vice (I think?) short documentary on one of the people who operate these kinds of coin-op machines. Was interesting, and honestly, kind of depressing.\n\nEdit: Found it: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORE2kqA1HD8).I saved a comment from u/baseburn- about this subject I feel I should share.\n\nThey haven't changed price because they never have to refill them. They just sit there collecting dust in the corner of grocery store entryways and backwater cafes, becoming progressively more stale as the years pass by. They retain their bright, glossy hues even then, but below the surface they have become adamant and chalky. One day a man weathered and old catches a glimpse of the little machine, paint chipped and falling to disrepair. It sparks something in him. Not a memory exactly... Perhaps just a memory of a memory, but it is strong enough to compel him to stop. He approaches the dilapitated globe, digging in his pocket for something. He draws out a silver coin and inspects it briefly before dropping it into the slot and turning the lever. It locks into place with a satisfying click and releases a large red gumball. The man watches with kindling excitement as the treat spirals down the track towards his waiting hands. He reaches for it, feeling blessed to have received his favorite color. After a moments admiration of the shining orb, he pops it into his mouth and smiles with contentment. The gumball is crushed between his gnawing teeth, giving way in dessicated, flavorless fragments. He's taken aback by the the repellent texture and immediately spits it out. \"Dog shit\" he laments, cruelly ripped back to reality. \"I guess it always was\".Sounds like a sweet deal to me.Goes to show how much of a rip off they always were if they're still profitable.I'd always see people and now coworkers doing fundraisers, always with a box or two of \"worlds greatest chocolate\" candy bars.  \n\nIt's always $1 and back then when you'd see them, most of the time people wouldn't buy them. After all it was cheaper at the store \n\nNow it's cheaper to buy those candy bars because it's cheaper than the store.Considering i own a couple, we definitely have slowly made the amount you get less. The price of the candy has gone up so your getting less candy wether you realize it or not. Also at least in my machines, candy doesnt sit in them longer than 3 months. Still somehow profitable if you have a lot of machines.I'd honestly rather put a buck fifty worth of quarters into one of those than buy a package of skittles[deleted]That should give you an idea of what a ripoff those machines have always been.The candy is slowing being filled with sawdust.StonksYou obviously are under 20 years oldThey haven't changed the candy in decades eitherYes because it's the same candy from when the price was decidedThey already have inflated they used to be 5 cents, and I'm seeing more and more that are now 50And dispense the same age candy..Reese's in ours are $1.50. No deal. I haven't seen a $0.25 machine in decades.You clearly aren\u2019t familiar with \u201cShrinkflation\u201d. The gum balls are smallerHate to break it to you... we used to have 1 cent candy machines.cough video games coughsome of them have the same candy in them from decades ago too!Weren't they penny/nickel machines before?Haven't seen a 25\u00a2 machine in a long time.  They are all at least 50\u00a2 now, with many being 75\u00a2 or $1.Most of the stores that had the candy machines are removing them where I live. They are becoming more rareThere were a lot more 10 cent machines 25 years ago and a lot more $1-$2 machines now. It's all balanced itself out and then some.Semi related video about a guy that made and lost a ton of money on candy machines:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ORE2kqA1HD8They changed the price lol I haven\u2019t seen 25C candy in a while.havent changed the candy either.Not necessarily, the machines I operate only give about 50% of the candy of the older machines.Nono, they're 50 cents now \n\nBack in my days I used to only have to pay a quarterThe real crazy one is to me is Costco's hot dog and soda for $1.50. All over the US, for decades it's been the same.Well the 25-cent machines use to be 10-cent machines and before that... 1-cent machines .Coca Cola once went 70 years without changing their prices\nEdit: for those interested check out the planet money podcast episode 416Most of the ones I\u2019ve seen nowadays are 50\u00a2I miss pogs and slammersbullshit. 25C *only* machines aren't a thing anymore. they're almost always .50-1.00 now. even that shit has inflated over the years.I converted my 401k to us postal service forever stamps about 15 years ago. I have been making out like a bandit since.They probably havent changed the candy eitherLots of them are 50 cents now.Also they haven't change the candy in decades and USUALLY dispense the same amount of change.not entirely to test this theory but i did one of those 25\u00a2 machines in the mall for runts and skittles and they definitely caught on and dropped the amount, i got i think 6 skittles and 5 runtsI think this really speaks volumes to what the actually price of the candy is. They've been making enough profit to keep the price the same for decadesThey havent changed the candies eitherInflation is not nessesarly bad. If handled properly I see it as better for consumers. Everything sold is $XY.99cents And it use to be $Y.99. Eventually it will be $XYZ.99, but something will always remain the same is the .99 cents. So no matter what you are paying that dollar. If the worth of a dollar goes down than that 99 cents matters less. Also a companies will be able to be more percise with costs. Currently most small items are $5 $10 etc.. Well if they are $100 or $50 well actually they can price things $75 without it being a weird $7.50 which means the prices can be lowered without the look of the price deterring customers.The people who own them also haven't changed the candy in decades.Well, the entire concept is in decline because *no one carries cash anymore*.Haven't changed the candy since they changed the pricesNo more 25 cents they 50 cents out here. Inflation my friendAnd they never change the candyI disagree, they dispense less candy than they use to.The key is to overcharge 20 years in advanceUgh. BS. They used to be 5 cents, then 10. Now they take dollar coins (in Canada at least)Pretty sure the candy has been in there for decades tooHave not seen a 25-cent machine in for ever but now it is $1 and $2 machines.  Inflation has followed in the vending machines.  Rest assured.You still need to fill the machine with candy, that you buy somewhere else where the price keeps getting higher due to inflationAlso, it's the same candy the company put in the machine when it was installed.See! The economy is fine!Fun fact; you can buy candy like that in bulk for dirt cheap. You can get 25lbs of candy for like $5I like to turn the knob ever-so-gently and halt, as soon as the candy pours (a little shake doesn't hurt). I've come away with large handfuls of delicious treats. Big Candy hates me.Oh shit...Here in Brazil these machines charge 2 reaisThe cost of making those candies also goes up so you dont profit that muchI used one for the first time in years the other day and I literally got 3 skittlesThe machines where I live just add another quarter slot, making them all 50\u00a2 now.I do still recall in the late 90s the pharmacy had an ancient candy machine that was 5 cents.Read Stephen Jay Gould's Phyletic Size Decrease In Hershey Bars.  'Nuff said.Brb gonna convert my life savings to candyFreddo chocolates are the greatest example of inflation. When my older siblings used to by them, they were 5p. When I bought them they were 10p. My nephew buys them for 25p, if at all.Which should go to show how much of a goldmine they used to be.They\u2019ve changed. When I was a kid, they were dime or nickel machines. Gum all machines were a penny. For reference, I\u2019m 47... old?... yeah probably so.The machines by me are all .50 so I don\u2019t know what machines you\u2019re talking about unless they haven\u2019t been touched in 10 yearsMaybe it was never a good deal and won\u2019t be for 50 additional years of inflation.Where?You must live in the Twilight Zone because candy machines here are $1.50 and up!Where can u find a 25 cent candy machiner/personalfinance\n\nDon\u2019t take it out of your budget.Candy stonksI am pleased.I wish arcade games followed the same trend.Kinda like the only thing on Earth like thishaha Thanks for telling everyone so the Devs can patch it.Yeah they also haven\u2019t changed the candy since they changed the pricesWowTIL you also got just 7 skittles for a quarter back in 1995.Candy machines used to be 1\u00a2Opposite of the laundry mat - I swear every seven years or whatever they just add another slot quarter slot.   At my apartment, laundry is 1.25 but by 2030 it will be 1.50 for sure.They reduce the amount of candyshhhhhhh, i have been running this for years don't screw me!My favorite growing up were those 10 cent chiclet machines, I haven't seen one of those in yearsI remember dime candy machines and (possibly?) even a nickel and I\u2019m mid 30\u2019sI don\u2019t know man.  My daughter got 3 M&M\u2019s out of one of those the other day.  Didn\u2019t seem like a very good deal to me.You just ruined for everybodyYea I don\u2019t think they make them anymore I think they\u2019ve been sitting there 30 years and the owners diedI've noticed the machines are changing. The one at my work gives you anywhere from 4-10 Mike and Ike's for a quarter. Still cheaper to pay the inflated store prices.We haven't had 25 cent machines here in my lifetime everything seems to cost at least a toonieNah, recently the m&m machine was \"updated\" to 50 cents instead of 25 cents. And obviously you don't get any more out...This just means we've been getting ripped off for decades!Stonks.jpgMore importantly, strippers are still getting tipped with singles\n\nYou think the guys in there have upgraded to fivers yet? Not a chance. Inflation is brutal for that line of workIt is 50 cents now and I got 9 Reese's Pieces.I'm fairly certain the trick with low end items is actually shrinkflation. They charge the same price but just make the candy/small item smaller.The circle of liiiiife \ud83c\udfb6Except now most take 3 to 4 quarters.1990's: \"Don't just go and throw away your money on a gumball!\"\n\n2020's: \"Hand me my exato knife. Done correctly, we can get at least 4 average sized sticks of gum outta this ONE gumball.\"Gum's gotten mintier lately, have you noticed?Hell, sometimes they dispense MORE candy.Just goes to show how much of a ripoff it is.I just figured today\u2019s my cake dayIs it coincidental that they are harder and harder to chew each year?They can adjust the amount dispensed though. And for what you're paying per portion, its still a terrible value vs buying a pack for yourself.In Brazil these machines are getting ridiculous, they started at 50 cents (BRL) and used to dispense handfuls of bubble gums, 2 big round bubble gums or one rubber ball, then they went up to 1 BRL and new machines were invented, ones that dispensed tiny pokemons, ones with bigger rubber balls and all kinds of things. Now we have machines that dispense toys and cost around 5 BRL. They're just getting ridiculous.they also dispense the same candy for 20 yearsOh they\u2019re changing alrightVery trueShhh, don\u2019t remind themBecause the average person's income relative to inflation hasn't risen over that period of time, even though the fixed price may result in a better value, affordability remains the same...or possibly even less affordable than 25c would have been considered decades ago.Candy is terrible for your health. So there's thatGood place to save money on vaccinations.Most have had the same Peanut M&M\u2019s or Boston Baked Beans in them first those several decades.The ones on Long Island were upgraded to be 50cents and 75centsSame with Arizona tea and Jack in the box tacosThe Age of the candy is also inflating :PThe cost of candy has reduced tho.Most of the candy machines in my area are now 50 cents. Very few are a quarter, anymore.I wish there was a candy machine but instead of gum balls it dropped feces straight into my mouth like soft serve ice creamGoogle: shrinkflationsame thing with dollar tree, but you all aren\u2019t ready for thatThey could also save someone with a low blood sugarI'm going to say no. What people don't calculate is the hidden costs of purchases - the costs that are not payed at the initial transaction. Like purchasing gas, where the cost of pollution is borne by the public at large, and not the company that produces and sells it. That's how capitalism works: hide the true cost of items  to remove the liability from the seller and call it economic growth. While the candy price is the same, the price for the dentist to fix the cavity or the hospital to cure the heart disease has gone up significantly. The cost of that one piece of candy might be a small fraction of the overall pattern of behavior that leads to those hidden costs, but they are still there. It's time for the true cost to be accounted and included in the purchase price.Inflation decreases the value of the quarter. So your giving the same amount of candy for lessNot sure where all of you are seeing these inflated machines. I have a 5 year old and she gets plenty of candy after taking a quarter from my heart at the grocery store.I once saw an earwig crawling around in one of those machines$1 coins in Canada have allowed inflation to take hold of even these machines in some places...damn loonies.Shhh they'll figure it out and adjust it to the current fuckusintheass inflation rates.I work for a company in Pa that refills the \"peanut\" machines. Not sure why there are called that. We also can change the price to require 2 quarters or three or four. I've also seen some with restricted chutes to the dispensary. Sad world. Sorry.Same goes for Costco's hotdog and drink deal.  Hasn't gone up since the 80s.And yet they\u2019re somehow still a ripoff.they've switched to cheaper candy/ingredientsThe one I saw recently was 50 cents.Uhh not sure where you get your candy but all he candy places I go to now charge .10 for a .05 candythe candy is worth about $0.00 so it's not like there's any value.\n\nyou could just buy vinegar and sugar by the gallon and shovel it into your mouth for about the same effect.Lets be honest, we've all banged the handle back and forth for free M&M's.   Right?Actually, they have changed the prices. Now it's 50 cents for a gumball if not moreShhh, don\u2019t tell thembut who wants to eat that shitty candy9 out of 10 dentists agree. (This comment brought to you by the ADA)Particularly good value if you know how to use a paper clip.If you turn the knob slowly you get more candy. Also if possible give the machine a little shake for even more candy. Single stand machines. Works very well.And probably the same batch of candy \ud83d\ude05They were overpriced from the beginningIve seen this with sodaThat\u2019s because they were already making 20 cents on the quarter. Now they\u2019re making 24Shit you rightThey have changed them in my area atleast. 50c to $2 AUDThe difference between mechanical machines and electronic machines.  \n\nSoon, everything will be \u201csmart\u201d and a company will be able to raise prices or lower amount dispensed from a remote hub.  \n\nAnd people mostly won\u2019t care because they\u2019re just swiping a plastic credit card to pay so there\u2019s no tactile difference in the amount spent.They're a looney 1$ now. Most don't even have candy anymore, just cheap plastic toys.Candy will be the new currency in post nuclear war instead of soda bottle caps.The hell is a 25-cent candy machine?Yikes. It's probably the same candy from the 90's so they're making bankI\u2019ve seen more $.50 and $1 ones around malls in the US now. The $0.25 are still around though!But it\u2019s the same old dusty candy bro from 1992.The candy machines at my work cost 50c or $1In Canada most candy machines are now 1$-2$ because of our coins :( inflation exists in our candy machinesThere was this trick I learned that on the old machines with the metal handle, if you twist it fast (without putting any coins), it would let a few loose. I would do that over and over again until I was satisfiedDon't remember me the problems of going from pesetas to euros. 1000 pesetas became 6\u20ac, but for kids, 5 pesetas gum or candy turned 5 cents. 25 pesetas chips bags turned 25 cents, and even the cinema got proportionally more expensive. 10\u20ac became 1000 pesetas, even when it was equivalent to 6\u20ac.\n\nI had like 10 at the time and suddenly you couldn't afford most of the things you could afford before the euro.Before it was 5 centI thought they used to be 5 centsI mean... the machine is the expensive part. The cost to fill is basically negligible when buying the candy in bulk. It\u2019s probably like a 1000% markup.In Canada we gave $1 and $2 coins so these gumball machines are all usually $2 for a handful of m&m's.It just shows the markupThe machines have a customizable dispense amount for the candy, the switch over to 50 cent units *is* happening, just not everywhere or immediately. The whole machine stays the same and you just swap out the coin taking part with a different one that fits.Not changed the value? Whens the last time you used one? Most times ive seen them now they adjust the machines to take 50 cents to a dollarThey use to be nickel machinesThe ones in my area are $1 nowThis is not true. You can adjust how much candy is dispensed inside the machine. Otherwise, you would need to replace the mechanism every year to keep up with rising costs.What fucking alternative universe are you living in?Actually you can adjust how much candy comes out. My uncle owns a ton of dispensers and he says his machines probably dispense around half of what they used too for 25 cents.Pretty sure the candy is also decades old and kids don't fuck with change anymore, that metal shit is for grandma.   Candy machines don't venmo.Ew. All those dirty ass kids touching those dispensers, I'll pass.Vending machines in my office accept card only and prices have been steadily rising. What cost 1$ 4 years ago is now 1.5$I wish the same could be said for arcade games.The candies tend to be knock offs for a quarter. The fake runts I got were chalky and tasteless last time and bee coating was thick. It usually cost 50 cents in my area for good shjt like Spree, Reece\u2019s Pieces, or runts.\n\nI still don\u2019t mind a quarters worth of Mike and Ike\u2019s but still a rip off.They used to have these \"penny candies\" I used to get at this little market near my house as a little kid. I could get like hundreds for a couple bucks. \n\nI watched them get more expensive as I got older. First to like \u00a22, then \u00a25, then finally \u00a210 before I stopped seeing them there altogether.Honestly they dispense less candyAnd the same amount of germs.Wait till he hears about penny candy. Blow his mindThey do dispense more candySame thing can be said about videogames but somehow people still complain.\n\nGames have been $50 - $60 since the 90s. And games are actually getting longer and more detailed, so it's even a better value after  inflation.\n\nWhy are people still complaining?Their profit margins were insane back then \ud83e\udd23It\u2019s doubled in price around I where I liveThere\u2019s a rainforest named after Amazon?Why would you say this, idiot. Now they now our secretsThat is false.  The prices have increasedThose 25 cent candy machines used to be nickel candy machines.They used to be 20 cents in Australia when I was a kid (I'm 22) now most of the ones I see are like 2 dollars.A lot of people don't seem to understand that instead of a more direct approach to curbing inflation, the U.S. is just using cheaper and cheaper material to make your money with, to the point that the metal you carry is worthlessDoes anyone remember buying penny candy. Literal 1 cent candies. Not from the machines, just in general. I used to go with a couple dollars and the lady would count out 200 gummy bears.They cost a dollar now in CanadaI don't believe this is true. The size has gotten smaller.Most I see are loonie machines with plastic rings or bouncy balls!Something that I've always wondered is how the dollar store will survive with inflation.I was just at the mall today and all the machines were 50\u00a2I remember when soda machines cost a quarter.  My dad remembers when a pack of smokes cost a quarter.Goes to show ya what a rip off it is and has been if they're still profitable at the same priceShort the candy dispenseing company. Stonks right here. Much stonk money's to be made.That's so weird, I mean 25 cents is basically pocket change at this point.Don\u2019t forget that producing the candy has also lowered throughout the yearsBut usually the candy I old and nasty!Likely because the profits margins were huge to begin with..?Or they've always been a poor value, and it's only getting incrementally better.I'm 27 and I don't think I've ever seen a machine that sells candy for a quarter. The ones at my work don't offer.anytbing for less than $1.10, and some candies go as high as $1.40.StonksNah. I have one in my house. It's got M&M's in it. They've been there for years. Every now and then I pop in a quarter to see how they taste. They taste like exactly like vomit.I used to love candy machines... until I thought about all the thousands of unwashed child fingers that have reached into those slots to remove the candy over the years.to any fellow music theory nerds, is it bad i read 25 cents and immediately thought of the music term? LOLWeird, the ones at the mall all cost $0.50 now.This must be why all the malls are closing.We have $1 & $2 coins in Canada unfortunately.Could also be because 25 cents for *that* amount of candy was always an absolute ripoff and so now their profit margins have only shortened a bit due to inflationNot where I live sadly :(Where the hell are you seeing candy machines with 25 cent prices? I haven\u2019t seen that since 1985.Lies!Poppers and Sticky HandsI'm pretty sure the portions are getting smaller though.\n\nThat, or my hands are bigger now.Shrinkflation25 cent? The only ones I've seen lately are 50.I have kids and so we frequent these machines. Around here they all transitioned to 50\u00a2 machines a few years ago.I live in Cali. Candy machines are 75\u00a2Those machines used to be really overpriced back in the 60s and 70s and haven\u2019t really changed that much today. When my mom was young, she used to go to penny candy stores. Where candy was only a penny a piece. And nowadays you can buy a jumbo bag of gum balls weighing in at like 5 pounds for a couple bucks. So 25 cents for a gumball, even with the inflation and the no change prices, is still not much of a deal. Just slightly better than previouslyThey also taste like dustWell, gumballs  cost the owners about .01 cents each, and they\u2019re 25 cents, so....The 25 cent dispensers in the one store I went to were exchanged for 75 cent dispensers...Makes you think about how much that candies worthah crap, i knew i forgot to do something back in 2000!Same for $60 video games. Shh.I once found a candy machine that spit out cashews. Of course, I put in my quarter and got my handful. Now, cashews are expensive and doing some rough math, I could this candy machine was a money sink. Needless to say, I got myself a couple more handfuls of cashews.Somebody check this guy! I bet he owns Candy machines!!!R/frugalOne time at a 25 cent peanut m&m thing I got 1 m&m. It was very very old. Still very delicious.We have one of those, but it\u2019s full of banana runts. Literally 97% bananas.If anything, it just goes to show how high the margins have always been on the damn things.Actually my family owns a vending company, and the reason the prices don't usually go up is because the places that sell their candy and pop (for us it's vistar) don't change their prices, that or when they do change prices it's usually not by much. Plus if we were to take a 1$ candy bar and change it to 2$ then most people wouldn't buy it. You would pay 1.20 for a Hershey bar but definitely not 2$There were two machines I recall that were a penny.  One was at a Marc's on Market Street that would dispense a small, round gumball about the size of an M&M.  The other was located at a car dealership down in Massillon, Ohio that also had a penny logo with Lincoln's face showing... might have been a used car dealership or it sold Lincolns?  In any event, that one dispensed 1-2 chiclets.\n\nIf I do see a 25-cent machine that has the round gumballs I get tempted to try one.  The super hard gum with flavor lasting about 30 seconds is nostalgically tempting.Except they used to be a nickel, before that a pennyYou can adjust the portion size when refilling the machine.Most of the ones I see cost at least $1. Haven't seen one for a quartet in yearsA dollar is still a dollar at a strip club.Dammit I\u2019m pregnant and suddenly gumballs sound fantastic.They also probably haven\u2019t been cleaned since they were placed at their current location.Take this down, don't give them ideas lmaoInvest rn guys you heard itMy uncle used to own vending machines and when he moved to Florida he left some inventory at my grandma's house. I randomly stumbled upon a huge box of multicolor gumballs lol. They were hard as fuck so my sister and I took them to a bridge over a some train tracks and dumped them as the freight cars were rolling by....Lol I haven't thought of that in years.The candies inside cost what, 10 cents? Lowering your profit margin by 2 cents may bot account for much.They tried raising them to 50 cents, but it decimated sales. 25 cents seems to be the sweet spot. No pun intended.They also haven\u2019t changed the candy in decadesAt the barbershop I go to they have a gumball machine that takes pennies.how do I invest in this?!?Also the candy inside those machines probably hasn't ever been refilled so it's about 20 years old...Ya and it's the same candy from decades ago tooI've seen machines demand $2 for a toddler sized handful of M&Ms, you can't tell me they haven't inflated with the rest of the market.\ud83d\udc4c, very nice shower thoughtCoca cola bortles used by 5 cents for like 80 years!Arizona iced teasI just don\u2019t know if f it\u2019s worth catching some kind of illness though.#ThanksForRuiningItYet still a 300% markup from just buying the candy inside the storeBut they could make the candy hollow or hollower = less candy.I've seen roaches crasling around inside those machines.They're also generally poorly maintained and are filthy.A little off topic, but I'm 26years old and absolutely obsessed with quarter machines, candy or not. I need the trinkets.You can actually adjust how much candy they dispense. Although my boss said it was a big pain in the ass. They readjusted because they put pnut butter M&Ms in and it was giving out like 3. In the end it was a gamble, sometimes you got 4 sometimes you could get 10. I'm sure in major grocery stores  they care a bit more though.They don't need much maintenance and I bet they have special deals with the candy companies. So everyone wins :)Makes sense since less and less people seem to use them, thus they need to get rid of product.[deleted]LMAO!\n\nMost candy machines in Australia now take $1 & $2 coins...\n\nSMH!!OkAnd they're increasingly rare.That\u2019s gotta be part of why toys are us went under. They had the best bank of coin op candy.And then you figure out how to use coffee sticks and the whole game changed.Excuse me but doesnt inflation work the opposite way around? Money is worth less as inflation rises, so if you are getting the same amount of candy you are actually getting it for relatively less if the price has stayed the same.How often do you think they clean the finger residue off from countless kids reaching in with fingers fresh from a visit from their nose or mouth?Yeah but the candy was made at your local mom and pop candy factory, now its generic Chinese crap.than again there is shrinkflation. Still the same candy but few% less of it.What? 25c used to drop a bowling ball sized gumball on your foot.Meanwhile, arcades went from 50 drachmas to 100 drachmas to 50 cents (170 drachmas) to 1 euro to press 5 to add credits in less than fifteen years.Similar to how 99c Arizona ice tea cans have not changed price or size in what feels like my entire life(I\u2019m 34)\n\nArizona has stated its due to the lack of advertising that allows them to stay so cheap. Everything about their brand recognition is through word of mouth and quality productThe best time to invest in 25 cent candies.They usually dispense the *same* candy.Nope. They\u2019re $0.75 now.Of course the candy has depreciated in value over the last few decades of rotting in those tiny little boxes.I wonder if they still have that certain point where you can stop turning the dial and it will stick in the open position and you can just keep shaking the candy out of the machineWait until the manufacturers start blocking half the distribution slots forcing to to make 2 turns to get something.stonks25-cent Candy machines are becoming a better value every year due to inflation as they haven't changed the candy in decades.  \n\nFTFYIt\u2019s all about the salted peanuts and cashews at the strip club in those machines.  Good with your $7 beer.But the candy tastes worse than dirt no thanksThat may be why I haven\u2019t seen one since I was in high school.Are you telling me to hold off on buying??Just to be clear. This is from a consumer perspective and not as the owner. Correct?It's even more impressive that 50 cent takes you to the candy shop.This... Isn't a shower thought. Once again this is just math at best.Actually, I have seen gumball machines that cost 75 cents per gumball!Candy is not of any value. Sugar is evil!Same with cans of Coke. I'm 35, and I feel like a can from a vending machine, has been $1.00 my entire life.So now instead of being 400% overpriced, they are only 375% overpriced.I'm not a candy guy tbf, but temp tattoos... gimme that sick lookin' scorpion.M I'm mnnn\u00f1nnnnnn\nN\u00f1m..mmnmnnm.nmmnmm.n.nInflation?  The candy costs .0003 cents to make.  You\u2019ve been lied to all along.Not really. Every time you pop one into your body it\u2019s hurting your health because of all that corn syrup and other crap. Hello diabetes if you consume too much.I see you Big Candy! Trynna steal all my pocket change and clear out your old inventory!Candy bars are actually slowly getting smaller. Sadly. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/food/article-5128597/amp/Graphics-reveal-chocolate-shrunk-size.htmlGood job, sounds like somebody learned about inflation in high school economics class today.25\u00a2? Most of them are $1.50, and the lowest I ever see in a store is 75\u00a2...For less than 25c, you can just get a whole bag (no less than the size of the candy machine compartment full of candy at a grocery store. So if anything, those machines are a rip-off. They always have been and will continue to be until we have another market crash.Don't forget the $1000+ in dental work after you crack your tooth on a fossilized good n plenty.Bouncy balls are still 25 cents and that\u2019s all that matters.I owned/operated candy machines before.  They go pretty quickly if in a decent location.  M&Ms and Jelly Bellies were my top sellers and needed to be refilled biweekly.Seriously. Last time I used one of those, I got some stale, dusty ass candy.Theres a gumball machine in my local mall with gumballs that have clearly faded in color from age.We have one in my shop... It is not regulated by my company. But instead is allowed to be there, because the owner is doing a favor for a long time customer and business neighbor of ours. \n\nProblem is, this dude is weird as fuck, uses his bare hands to level the candy out when it's in each section (there's 3). To give you an idea, he and his shower are somewhat on bad terms, he wears basketball shorts OVER his sweat pants... And he only stocks mother fucking Red Hots and Boston Baked Beans and some other weird ass red bean shaped candy. \n\nI fucking hate it so much. Its so gross. I mean nobody buys them because he sticks the most horrible candy in there but still. Fucking. Why?For real. I bought a gumball recently and it was literally sun-faded on one side. Did not eat.How does shit taste like?good protein tho,from all the insect larva insideI\u2019m speaking for the 0P and I say, \u201cTouch\u00e9!\u201dDamnit, Bill! You're gonna stick me with all that stale candy - let the kids with pocket money buy it all up first!! lol  \n\n\nThe comment overhead the most when people do buy from the machines?  \n\n\n\"Is this chocolate or cocaine? It's all white and powdery...\"Even if swapped out regularly I believe the cost of production for said candy will continue to be less costly as time goes on. Therefore you are *technically* paying the same amount, but the product itself *should be* less expensive than it is currently. \n\nExceptions would include homemade candy or small family owned candy maker/suppliers, maybe places that only use traditional equipment. \n\nAs far as big name suppliers, yeah you're paying way over what it should be if you looked over a cost of candy vs cost to product spreadsheet... Which I do not have.These jelly beans are vintage collector\u2019s pieces now, worth even more.Taste is subjective\nBold of me to consider you\u2019ve never been poor.>tastes like shit\n\nThat's really up to interpretation. For instance, your mother's asshole tastes like a dried up husk of bananas.\n\nI kid, they taste like shit because that's where they've been.Now and Later... way laterOr haven\u2019t been cleaned in 15 yrsGum balls taste better than regular gumOr they\u2019ve swapped out ingredients and replaced with shitty shit like palm oilActually, the value is not going up because of a very real thing called [shrinkflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkflation).Blasphemy! I actually love a finely aged handful of RuntsI\u2019m sure long thought dead diseases live in those thingsI dare anyone to try and eat a jawbreaker now.. probably break their teeth tryingDude, the banana runts dont go bad.Yea I was gonna say, they haven't cleaned them in decades either.Yessss 50 cents to a dollar for some super nice stickers and other stuff like small toys, gacky sticky hands etc[deleted]Parachute figurines.HolographicIf runts went the way of Trix cereal and changed their fruit shapes to round balls it would take years before we find out.bananaruntsgangOh my God now that you say this it's totally always runtz isn't it?And probably the quality too. I doubt the candies are actually from 1995, they just have their ingredients constantly downgraded to \u201cfood-like substitutes\u201d so often that they only *taste* like they\u2019re decades oldOr are your hands bigger now?[deleted]Came here to say thisI remember dime ones in the late 1980s/early 1990s.  You could only get gum balls from them.  The better candies were a quarter.\n\nMy parents told me you could really get penny candy when they were young in the 1950s.Are you thinking about the ones with toys?  Cause I've never seen one that sold candy for 1 dollar...At he local hardware store when I was a kid in the early 90\u2019s they had a candy machine that was only a penny.  I think it was either a gum ball or some chiclets.Wait are you saying this is an unresearched shower thought based on a faulty premise and less than casual observation?!? Noooooooo!Have you noticed gum\u2019s gotten a lot mintier latelyExcept for the Ed boys[deleted]Sponsored by Raid: Shadow LegendsBig Candy is at it againThank you. I was racking my brain trying to think if I was remembering it wrong. They **were** 5 cents!So crazy how expensive candy has gotten while also being smaller. I was at some gas station and even the non king sized, aka regular sized (which are also smaller than they used to be), were $2. \n\n$2 for a small chocolate bar that\u2019s mostly high fructose corn syrup anyway? Hard pass, uber pass.It's a scam even now lmfao. Who is paying 1$ for a Can. I only buy on sale 2L bottles for 1$ each and even at regular price they're 2$ so 1$/L vs the can having ~350ml meaning you're paying 3$/L.^ This is why I came here...When the candy has become a sugar berg with remnants of candy coating flowing through it.They mean [these](https://i.imgur.com/yPpFSHJ.jpg) candy machines, not [vending machines](https://i.imgur.com/4G42GiZ.jpg).Costco deliberately keeps it cheap so that people will stay and shop longerI think they are speaking from the perspective of the consumer, not the merchant.Imma need a link... asking for a friendWe stopped doing the 25 cent machines, no profit in them. Also, the multi-quarter slots add more complexity(and cost a good deal more), and the machines need more attention. It is easier in Canada than the US because we have 1 & 2 dollar coins, so mine can dispense more. \n\nNew, the machines cost several hundred, cost of the product, a cut of the gross for the host business, labour to visit, service, and collect the money regularly, plus the initial labour for a sale person to go around making business deals to get locations. Normally the sales people make a flat fee per location though.\n\nCoin op candy dispensers are very low margin. It can be years before a machine is in the black. If ever. \n\nLets say you get a 0.25 machine for $200.\nHalf hour to install, wipe it down, fill, adjust labels: say $10\n1000 mini gumballs at $0.02 cost each is another $20. \n\nYou come back two weeks later and the machine is nearing empty(say 700 sold), which is close to ideal(running out means you need to come more often). Each 0.25 dispenses 7 gumballs, your gross profit: 700x0.11 or $77, but you have to give the host business somewhere between 5 and 20% of the gross, pay an hour of labour(install + current visit), incidentals like vehicle expenses... and that finders fee has to be amortized. \n\nCoin jam one week in? No profit, quite possibly a loss. Little kids will stick anything in there, gum, piece of paper, pennies will jam it, as will dimes and nickles. \n\nYou can scale up somewhat with clusters of machines, but at some point, your variety is competing against itself, and going stale. You can visit less often, but businesses hate empty machines(and complaints about coin jams), and candy goes stale. You can dispense fewer pieces of candy, but that pisses people off, and someone might smash your machine.I feel like either you were getting fucked before on price or you're getting fucked now on material. Arizona Ice Tea is like that too.But it tastes good :o)Not for me. I remember them being 25 cents and then 35. Then up to 50, then 75.  I\u2019m 33 btw.Maybe in 1960...*Great return on investment!*Pft, you are asking for it eating those monstrosities of a candy. There is nowhere on the planet where you could put a machine filled with good n plentys and expect the candy cycle through in any time less than 10 years.Those teeth are weak anyway and it\u2019s helpful to get that over with early in order to build a stronger structure.That just sounds like karma for choosing good n plenty.I did it on a mac and cheese bite from white castles.  That day may of been stressful.We also learn more each year about the negative health effects of sugar so maybe the deal isn't really getting that much better.  \n\nStill, I do love me some vending machine gum.Who the hell buys that shit anyway? The gum balls must have been in there for YEARS.Who's getting good n plenty?! There are only plenty because the are NOT goodIt's been 2.5 years since this happened to me. Not from a 25 cent machine but a Good 'n' Plenty got me. I used to love them but now I can't trust them.\n\nIn other news I haven't skipped a night wearing my bite guard since.good and plenty is an abomination. \n\nThere's a reason they are still in the machine.Don't forget the $1000+ in no longer required dental work when a fossilized Good'N Plenty **BECOMES** your new tooth!Are there actually people who enjoy good n plentys who don't wear dentures though? Lol ewYou deserve it for enjoying good n plenty.they mix so well with gumballs in those big spiral machines tooMan, I'm all about those shiny stickers and tiny alien figuresTwice a week or fortnightly?Frank Murphy??Damn.candy machines need more variety. All I mostly see is shitty bubble gum and maybe Skittles. Some do have chewy spree though[deleted]My mom ran a daycare and put a machine in the entrance so kids would beg for candy every afternoon. It worked too. Easy money.$0.25 for a decent pull of Jelly Bellys is a steal.A restaurant I worked at had one with M&Ms, with one candy stuck between the glass and the paper insert saying what was inside. The machine was owned by the guy who owned the place. I was there for 2 years before leaving, came back two years later and it was still there looking all faded from the sunlight and time. I pointed it out to him and he told me he'd give me $5 if I ate it, I said $20 and he agreed. \n\nIt tasted like I ate a ball of dust, had the same consistency as well.> stale, dusty ass candy\n\nIf it was ass candy, that'd be why it tastes like shit.That candyShittyhttps://youtu.be/W6nFVKfm-9EOr temporary tattoosBootleg Loony Tunes stickers with Taz, Daffy, and Bugs dressed like Kris Kross.Homies figurines! I bought so many of them, but never got the wheelchair homie.Dyed Rabbits feet 50\u00a2Helmets... had to keep buying them to get the one you want... they did that with all of that stuff.... fuckers.I used to get rock band stickers out of machines like that.  Tried to find a Metallica one for my mom but I ended up with Queensryche, Megadeth, and a few others I can't remember.That's basically gobstoppersI thought Trix went the opposite route. Didn't they go from round balls to fruit shapes?Back to round balls*I still eat Runts candy at 25 years old. Walmart has that $1 boxed candy down the candy aisle.Literally the only banana candy in the history of ever that I likeBanana runts are the shit.i wish it was runtz, cuz that's a dope ass strain of wacky tabacky:\n\n\"Upon sparking up and taking that first hit, expect your worries and woes to melt away under the overwhelming blanket of positivity that is Runtz. Not only will you be feeling great, but you\u2019ll also have the sweet aftertaste of candy in your mouth from the smoke. You\u2019ll likely feel euphoric and happy, but not enough to leave the house. After a sesh of Runtz, you\u2019re going to want to find a sofa or bed to stretch out and relax on, as your physical pains melt away and your mind expands.\"[deleted]Nope. Younger brother found a machine that puts out 5 M&Ms for 25cent a week or so ago. Ones I've tried have reduced quantity as well.8 swedish fish > 5 swedish fishThanks for the information, that was very helpful.1980's still had jube jubes for 1 cent. Then went to 2 cents then 5 cents. Not sure about todayThere was a Ben Franklin 5 and Dime near us when we were kids in the 90's. You could still get candy there for a nickel apiece. But we're talking about *one* jawbreaker. Still it was a ton of fun to go there with like $5 and get a whole bunch of weird candy.Small town in the US and you could still get penny candy in the early 90s at many places in my area. Even the pharmacy would have a barrel of it that you could pick out of.I got penny candy in the 90s. Tootsie Rolls and wax bottles, small stuff like that.\n\nEdit: spellingYeah but wouldn't also pennies be \"stronger\" in value back then? Like equivalent to nickels or something nowadaysBut the ones with toys used to be a quarter too.[deleted]Not really, I\u2019ve always been more of a cinnamon fanWhat did you say?

At least that's what they call them by me.Yes  you are most probably right.Agreed.

M&Ms are ideal since they don't melt or stick together.  That's why you see bubblegum and hard candies like skittles.  They don't jam or get stuck in the dispensing mechanism.  Plus they have a longer shelf life.Im thinking about getting some of these machines to give people like yourself a greater variety, i present to you: skittles and m&ms in the SAME machine!

I got one and I cried when I was six or seven I was so happy.gobstoppers = danger trixYeah but they went back to balls again :(So I want to say some point before 2010 they went from shapes to balls, and then maybe a few years ago they changed back to fruit shapes. I don\u2019t know what state they are in nowIt's cause it tastes like a different type of banana, idk the names. Apparently that's a banana we could really eat but we use a different strain.Descriptions of strains are so bunkNo, cheap modern candies are usually made from high fructose corn syrup, as opposed to candies made from sugar derived from sugarcane (as they were decades ago). \n\n\nAlso, you\u2019re thinking of honey- that\u2019s the only food that doesn\u2019t rot. Candy can definitely degrade over time and not taste as good.Literally everything you just said is incorrect.No Swedish fish> any Swedish fishI was born in 1990. We had penny candies at the corner store. You could also trade in bottles and cans at 5\u00a2 a piece. Good times.My sister and I used to play penny poker with my grandfather, 100 pennies from his giant jar of tens of thousands of them. When we were done we would take the 100 pennies to this little shop at the end of the road and get a whole handful of candy with it. A lot of it was 1 cent a piece.\n\nThis was in the late 80'sThere was a neighborhood ice cream and candy place near me in the late 90s in PA. Jawbreakers were 5\u00a2, and I clearly remember walking 3 blocks to this store with a single nickel so I could get a white jawbreaker the size of a penny.i mean some of em yea but they also had 50 cent and dollar onesWrigley\u2019s also slyly began adding artificial sweetener (acesulfame potassium) to their classic sugar gums around the turn of the millennium for \u2018longer lasting flavor\u2019. \n\nOnce the sugar is dissolved away, the artificial sweetener still makes the gum taste (fake)sweet. \n\nThese days if you want a simple sugar gum without artificial sweetener you have to find a vintage gum; last time I checked the Beemans/Clove/Blackjack gums haven\u2019t added artificial sweetener.Go onSo... in line with inflation.So the real problem is that people don't have self control and discipline?NoThose ones full of condoms must be owned by the American Dental Dam Association.This is that moment when you need to look at your life and ask \"am I an anti-dentite\"?I meant what I said and I said what I meant!10 seconds and a video can do the same thing, but for free!Mom?Yeap they exist to make kids needy and whiney till the parent gives in.5 seconds of flavor and then you're chewing on old rubberFellow G & P aficionado.

    "Comments": "Responsible people know their limits or consequences for their actions.My niece just turned 19 and already has a kid. So far I think the baby thinks my cousin is her mother and not her grandmother.My parents were 19 when they had me. They were not the best parents. On my 19th birthday I thought to myself \"Could I have a child and raise it properly at this point in my life?\" I decided no. It helped me forgive them a little bit. And I also made the choice to not have children. I guess I learned from my parents mistakes? \ud83d\ude00Dude when I was 18 I worked as a cashier in a pharmacy. We had another worker who was in my class and was pregnant. They ALWAYS compared her to me. I had my tongue pierced and an industrial piercing in my ear. The other just mentioned she MIGHT take out her belly button ring and everyone in the pharmacy was telling me I needed to \u201clearn from her\u201d and \u201comg she\u2019s so responsible, you could use a friend like her.\u201d I looked them strait in the eye and said \u201cshe\u2019s pregnant at 18 and I\u2019m not, please don\u2019t tell me who\u2019s more responsible and who needs to influence who.\u201d \n\nAfter she had the baby, she partied all the time. Her parents or her little sister babysat this kid nearly daily. I would see her out all the time and at the same parties and stuff. The pharmacy comments then turned into \u201coh she\u2019s a young mom and that\u2019s so hard. She needs to let off steam.\u201d She then got a DUI and they still acted like she was so much more responsible and better than me. I hated that place.They talk about this in the movie IdiocracyI am kind of a 19 year old with the self awareness not to have a baby, but i would not take any care of a baby, lol i just dont know anything about itIt's worth noting that self awareness and a sense of responsibility are not static, fixed properties. \n\nSometimes irresponsible people have kids by accident, then make the decision to change, so they step up and do right by the kid and become good parents.So the obvious solution here is to give every 19yo without babies, the babies of the 19yos who did have them.I had a baby at 19. On purpose and I was married at the time.  Pretty poor decision. But it grew me up super fast.  He's 24 now and a wonderful person.  Not all teen parents give their kids to their parents or are terrible parents themselves. But they have to be willing to grow up.People that don\u2019t want to be cops would probably make better cops.[deleted]Similar to: the best politician is one who doesn't want to be a politicanI\u2019ll give you the true answer.  No one knows until that baby is born.  Either the switch flips on, is on or will never turn on.  You only know who will truly prioritize a child until that reality comes.  You can read all the books in the world, but parenting is true sacrifice and for all the parents just trying to give your kids a better life.... I love youI've heard this one before. On behalf of the people with the self awareness not to have babies... Hard pass.You're probably right, at least in most cases.Omg. My 20 year old cousin, who has no job, no education, and can\u2019t support himself, despite his parents giving him every opportunity to go to school and they would pay for it, just got his 18 year old gf of 2 months pregnant. \n\nThe kicker? They fucking tracked her cycle and PLANNED for it. WtfYou\u2019re getting dangerously close to just saying \u201csmart people perform better in society\u201dBabyless 19 year old also probably had educational, income, and healthcare advantages... Support network, etc. Individual problems are social problems.Isn't it ironic? You have to pass a written and practical test demonstrating basic proficiency before you're allowed to drive a car, but anybody can bring a new human being into the world, even with no skills or interest in good child-rearing.This is such a horribly judgmental thread. There are people who have kids at 40 and make terrible parents. No one is a perfect parent, and accidental pregnancies happen at every age.[deleted]Well I didnt have my baby till after I turned 20 but I'd like to think I did a pretty good job. She was an oops baby not an on purpose baby I just didn't want to get an abortion. Married to her dad, shes doing very well in school, amazing artist and kicks butt at video games. Maybe I just got lucky.Raw sex often takes precedence over rationality.\"the people you\u00a0want\u00a0to lead are the\u00a0ones\u00a0that are most resistant to being\u00a0leaders\". This applies to a lot of other things too including your postI\u2019ve met some really good and caring young parents. Hell a girl I went to high school with was a great mother at 15 and is now a registered nurse. \n\nBroadly, yeah. Teenagers make bad parents. But having a baby really changes a lot of people.Don\u2019t underestimate the resentment that a parent can have towards an unwanted child. It does not go well for the kid. \n\nFrom personal experience, I would have much rather grown up with a poor mom that loved me than a financially stable mom who didn\u2019t.\"You are not mature enough to make the decision to have an abortion.\"\n\n......uhhhhhh....Unpopular opinion:\n19 year olds can be mature enough to take care of a babyShout out to all the 19 year old absent fathers that were self aware enough to know they didn't want children and bounced.This is always stated from a bias POV. Same people who call every kid a \u201ccrotch goblin\u201d cause they\u2019re so quirkyI completely get what ur saying, but some ppl don\u2019t always have that choice and have to grow up faster bc of itOr you could be completely wrong and the 19 y/o could step up to become a great father/provider. The world is not black and white it's black, white, and a whole lot of grey in the middle!Surgeon here. This became acutely apparent to me a few years ago I did appendectomies on two different 16 year old girls on consecutive days. On the first day, the girl I treated was an honors student, held down a part-time job, and did lots of extracurricular activities. She was the most responsible teenager you'd ever want to meet. But because she was under 18, society had determined she wasn't responsible enough to make her own decisions, and  I needed her mother to sign the consent form for the procedure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day, the other 16 year old had already given birth to a baby, moved out of her parents' house, and was living with her boyfriend. She was an \"emancipated minor.\" So, in the eyes of the eyes of the law, she was responsible enough to make her own decisions:  \n\n\n[https://www.peoples-law.org/issues-minors-seeking-emancipation-parents#:\\~:text=In%20Maryland%20there%20are%20exceptions,pre%2Dnatal%20care%20and%20abortion](https://www.peoples-law.org/issues-minors-seeking-emancipation-parents#:~:text=In%20Maryland%20there%20are%20exceptions,pre%2Dnatal%20care%20and%20abortion).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis walking poster child for bad decision making signed her own consent form, unlike the more mature girl the previous day.My mom did an amazing job, she was 19 when she had me. But I tend to agree, there is a lot of people that do not think about all the stuff that goes with having a baby.\n\nI know I'm to irresponsible to have a kid, that is why I never had any and do not want any kids of my own. I'm good with kids for entertaining them and listening to them, but not so much a good role model.Now tell me something less obviousI\u2019m the only person my age on my mom\u2019s side of the family that hasn\u2019t knocked anyone up.\n\nI went to a fucking *catholic* school, so that should tell you about my sex Ed situation.\n\nAre condoms ***really*** that difficult to understand???????I'm 18, I could take care of a baby if I had financial support, bit it would stop almost everything else in my life.Does this take into account having sex without protection?  You would think that a 19 year old with the \"self-awareness\" to not have a baby would also have the \"self-awareness\" to be as protected as you can when having sex.  And yes I get it that not all pregnancies are the result of unprotected sex, but let's not fool ourselves and think that a large majority of these pregnancies aren't due to poor sex decisions.This played out in my family when the 19 year old took custody of the infant the 21 yr old LEFT at the hospitalThis thread reminds me of Idiocracy. Specifically the couple that delayed having kids until it was too late even though they most likely would have made excellent parents.I definately understand the logic behind that statement. I don't disagree yet.....\n\n...doesn't 19year old A automatically becomes 19year old B?\n\n\nI'm 33 with the complete self-awareness that no baby should be in my care. A pancake would take better care of a baby than I would. I feel that my self awareness, is absolutely not a hint of hidden maternal competence.Not for nothing, but at least some of the 19-year olds with no kids are just virgins with no particular intelligence or skills (maybe why they're virgins).\n\nNot saying that the ones who did have kids are smart (although they will get the little fuckers out of the house while they're still young enough to do stuff), but not all the ones who don't, don't because of their immense willpower and big wrinkly brains.\n\nAlso, not all the ones with kids are dumb, alcohol is a thing, condoms break, cute boys lie about using one...Accidents happen, a lot of 19 year olds don\u2019t intend to have a child but take up the responsibility instead of giving the child awayThis is generalised bullshit. Some of the greatest parents I know had their babies at 19.\n\nIn fact only a generation or so ago most parents were around this age....this is why I'm pro-choice as fuck. Also why none of my friends, all around 30, have a kid. It's become unrealistic.\"Self- awareness\" doesn't prevent pregnancy. You can be self-aware and still get pregnant.Just for context, the OP of this thread didn't come up with this as an original thought. If you look in the r/predaddit you'll find that a 19 y/o unexpectedly is having a baby and struggling with the stresses of becoming a father. Instead of lending some experience or words of wisdom, this douche bag is shitting on this guy!! So fuck the OP!Its not like people do it on purpose, accidents happen, children are born and you have to take care of them. I'm 22 and have no kids, i can babysit, but a  19 yr old parent would probably do a much better job especially since they know their kids needs better than i would.I found out I was pregnant at 19 years old, after my birth control failed (turns out that type and my now diagnosed medical condition sometimes have issues, took my doctors a bit to figure that one out). I won't say I was a perfect Mom to him back then, but I made the choice to have him, so I made the choice to take care of him the best I could. He was the first best thing to ever happen to me, and because of him I became a better person (will always try to be working on that, for all of my family now). \n\nWhile I would never suggest anyone intentionally get pregnant at 19 years old, I do know that with support (I had a little in the beginning, but it was not the kind people should have), it can be done. Hopefully less 19 year olds have to make that choice if moving forward we can educate them and have proper support before (as in access to contraception).This is true for most parents that want to wait till they have a decent home and stable income. Which is also bad for humanity biologically because younger parents tend to have the healthiest reproductive systems and sperm/eggs. Especially women who are born with all of their eggs at birth. You have to remember even the youngest mother's possible biologically have eggs that are already at least a decade old. It's kind of amazing these cells stay viable for literal decades when most mammals will have completed their entire life cycles dozens or more  times over that long period.As a child free person I know for damn sure I'd make a better parent than half the people my age who are having kids. I just know my limits and know I can't care for and do not want to care for another human. So I won't. I'll take a cat over a kid any day.What role does self-awareness play in accidental pregnancies?[deleted]Just like how the kind of people who play the lottery are the least well equipped to handle winning the lotteryMost 19 year olds can barely even look after themselves, so a baby should be completely out of the question.That's called responsibility.r/showerparadoxesIdiocracy is a genius satire that plays into that idea very well. If you haven\u2019t watched, I def recommendSee Clevon from Idiocracy for referenceWait until you realize this is true for all peopleI have 7 nieces and nephews. My SO and I will not be having kids for a very long time. I've seen what having children looks like when you're in your 20s, many times over. I want no part of it.I\u2019m 24 and I don\u2019t think I can take care of a dog right now. Like. How tf am I going to take care of a baby???this is completely false, nobody knows until the baby is bornThis. Is. Privilege.Generalization: none of the people I knew in school that got knocked up before 20 were intelligent.Bullshit. If you're a good parent you figure it out for your child. I certainly did.[deleted]My mom was 19 and doubted herself. \n\nSo, bet.Same applies to guns. Owners that have a healthy respect for weapons make better owners than people who just think it's badassIf there's a better pro-adopt argument than this, I haven't seen it.A mature couple who are waiting to adopt can probably do it better than both.Umm yeah that is the case for literally any ageHey, all I can say is life happens.  You never know who or what is going to do what to whom.  I appreciate your thought, I just think it is a little naive.This is why \"it takes a village\" and babies brought up with strong community do betterSelf awareness and empathy go a long way. I had my child in my 30's and still didn't feel prepared. Nobody ever feels prepared to be responsible for nurturing and preparing another sentient human being to act in a responsible way in society without you there to protect them anymore. \n\nNothing will cost you more sleepless nights, anxiety, angst, hope, regret... But nothing else is as rewarding either.\n\nNobody should ever be pressured into keeping a child they don't feel prepared to properly raise. But I also hope someone explains that every parent feels that way.\n\nThe older you get, the more you realize, the adults are just figuring it out as they go along too.As a child of who's parent was 19 I can confirm.Accidents can happen to self aware 19 yos. And they can still be kick ass parents.I've often heard that people who don't want kids would make great parentsI\u2019m 29 and know I\u2019m responsible enough to know I\u2019m not responsible enough to have a baby.You can just remove the 19 year old part and it\u2019s still trueIt\u2019s a lot easier to not get pregnant when you\u2019ve got money and access to health care so that you can get birth control. Plenty of irresponsible 19 year olds that don\u2019t get pregnant because they have resources. If we actually cared about this issue as a country, birth control would be free and easily accessible.I have never known my father. My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic. I have never wanted a child based on the reality of my situation growing up. I always thought about how terrible I felt being alone growing up and how I wouldn\u2019t have wished it upon anyone. I never wanted to take the chance of passing on mental illness or just letting them down. For my life, I belief to this day I have made the right choice. I will be 38 this year. Instead of having a child. I volunteer at shelters and am signing up to be a big brother. I have never regretted my decision one day in my life. Do what\u2019s best for your life and don\u2019t look back!I got pregnant on birth control at 19,I was in no way ready for a baby but  I think being aware of how hard a baby would be and how much of a responsibility was really helpful.Raise your hand if you were abused by a narc parent!!! Almost everyone I know age 25 and up don\u2019t have parents who should have ever been parents.Also coming up after the break, water is wet and sky is blueIn general the people who are more likely to question how good of a parent they'd be would probably be better parents than the ones who just pop them like zits. It's the the reason for the whole \"stupid ones breed the most\" trope.This is what I've been saying since I was a teenager.  Those of us who are responsible enough to be decent parents at a very young age, are also usually unfortunately/fortunately the ones who are responsible enough to make sure we DON'T have babies at a very young age because we know it's not a good idea for ourselves or the child.If one more person tells me I'm great with kids I'm going to have one and ruin it on purposeHeadline reads no shit SherlockWhen I was 19 I actually knew another kid my age who had a kid and this is totally correct. Dude took care of his kid but was a total dumbass.This is the core premise of Idiocracy.Welcome to the plot concept of idiocracy.41 year old with a baby here. Still can hardly figure this shit out.Yes, this is the root problem of societyThis is one of those \n\n\"No. Fucking. Shit.\"\n\n-Type of thoughts.as the only male of my friend group from high school not to get a girl pregnant i can concur.Well, no shit guy. Lower your shower water temperature...That\u2019s exactly the reason why most 19 year olds who have babies, have babies in the first place. If they were self aware enough to realise the work and responsibility being a parent involves, they most likely wouldn\u2019t have had one.I\u2019m 60, and I can\u2019t even take care of a house plant.Most people who had kids that young have a terrible support system where their community pressures them to have unprotected sex by shaming use of contraceptives and no access to abortion morally or otherwiseThere was a program on public radio that followed two high school girls in a class that gave them dolls that simulate caring for a real baby. One girl was in theater, and was a free spirit with zero plans to get pregnant soon, or if ever. The other was raised in a very traditional, very religious family who wanted a family ASAP. By the end of the program they had both switched. The baby simulation had the religious girl in tears and completely overwhelmed. The other girl liked the feeling of being responsible for another human being.How is this a showerthoughtNah. Reverse-ageist. The unexamined premise here is that choosing to have children at age 19 necessarily exhibits a lack of self-awareness. \n\nWhich is a very 21st century blindspot, but its currency doesn't make it any less stupid.\n\nIn other words, perfect r/showerthought.ITT: A massive mob angrily judging teen Moms.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what people\u2019s circumstances are. Their community may have a different set of values than your community. They may have decided they wanted to start a family earlier than you did. They may have gotten pregnant accidentally and didn\u2019t want to get an abortion.\n\nAll the same, you have no right to sit in judgement of them. And in fact, by judging them, you\u2019re the one making it harder on them and their child.This is such a trashy postWhich is why abortion is an essential part of societyreplacing one stereotype with anotherA man's got to know his limitationsAs my deck buddy says: \"Those parents who decide they need parental classes to be better parents, really arent the parents that need to take those classes\"This is the plot of Idiocracy.Not sure I agree. I know some very young women (18 & 20) who are amazing mothers.This post screams fake deep. You could say that about anythingDarwin says otherwiseI really don't know why some people and TLC glorify teen pregnancy and underage pregnancy. Iti is not fair even the parents are okay and this should be avoided at all costs.Can borderline eugenicists please start shutting the fuck up. You're so smart and know just what's best for humans that you \\*checks notes\\*... ignore millennia of human history evidencing a very clear, working naturalistic order.I can agree to this as I was a 19-year-old with self awarenessThis is not speculation this is truth, and I see it IRL everydayI'm gonna say that's a no, at the very least it still depends on the individual. I didn't want kids when I was young because I fucking hate needy things that don't shut up. So honestly if I had a kid when I was 19 I would most likely abandon that useless annoying shit.Except that having a baby chemically changes you and the sacrifices you have to make aren't any small matterI get the idea, but someone with a baby knows how to take care of a baby better than someone without one.So we should ban abortions for young women whow want to have one and make it mandatory for the others?\n\nHow would that even work? I'm sure the word would get around...\n\n/s \n\nI need to create a fake account for all the dumb shit that cones to my mind...Imo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple, having a child at a certain age doesn\u2019t determine the level of responsibility you haveI still don\u2019t understand why people have kids before they even reach 20. Do you hate yourself? Why would you have a kid just before you get to experience freedom lol.\n\nI\u2019m 32 and still dodging that shit and leaving that for my 40s to deal with.what's your point?  plenty of responsible people have kids, intentionally or unintentionally, when they are in their teens.  Sometimes life happens and who is anyone to judge someone's effectiveness being a parent?Nope, a 19 year old is just the same as any other 19 year old with a baby.This is like anyone who wants to be a cop would be a worse cop than anyone who doesn\u2019t want to be a cop.What if the 19 year old has stable income and wants to start a family young with a committed partner?... I was 19. Didn't want kids ever. Was excited about 21 and going to parties. Let my gf at the time control the condoms. She said she was on birth control. Everything seemed good. It wasn't. She got pregnant. She kept it. My son is my world. His mother is a horrible person, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be a bad father.Yeah, nah. This makes no sense.r/childfreeThis is the most narcissistic shower thought I've ever seen. \n\nYou have zero idea what it's like to have to step up to the level of responsibility required to be a single parent, making sacrifice after sacrifice to support the little person you've made. \n\nInstead, you sit on your high horse judging anyone who doesn't follow the same life path as you, most likely because they haven't been given the privileges and opportunities you have. \n\nI hope you never have children. They'll end up arrogant pricks, just like you.Fair point.\u201cProbably\u2019s\u201d go nowhere. This is not fit for r/showerthoughts.My son is gonna be 14 next month. When his mother was pregnant she was 18 and I was 19. By the time he was born she was 19 and I was 20. Though we're not together, our son is amazing. Smart, handsome, healthy and an all around great kid. So yeah. Go fuck yourself.Ya I'm sorry but I've never had sympathy for people who accidentally get someone pregnant post 16 years of age. Wear a fucking condom or take fucking birth control lol it's so simplePeople who decide not to have kids at all are probably more kind to humanity than those who inflict life on non-existent beings by bringing them into existenceFate loves irony[removed]*Wears lead suit and enters comment section*op is 19 lolAntinatalism is such an odd movement to spread through a society.Thinks wont be able to take care of baby. opts to kill baby. at least there's consistency there.My sister got pregnant at 19 during a manic episode. Surprisingly she takes care of her kid better than she can take care of herself.False dichotomy: assuming that all 19-year-olds with children only have them because they lack self-awareness. \n\nThe best parent is the one who knows that everyone has gaps and limits, age is not a guarantee of good parenting, and who actively seeks help and knowledge while making a sincere effort to parent well.\n\nIt's not like living longer without children is going to magically give you experience in raising children.I don't know about that. I waited until my 30s before I had a kid and I can honestly say I would not have been able to handle it in my 20s.Being attentive to a baby is not the same skill set as being a prudent adult.I have a buddy who just told me him and his GF are expecting.... I\u2019m not so sure he\u2019s excited, mostly because it was her idea and she\u2019s the same girl whos 20, sub 100lb, literally only eats chicken tenders and fries every night, cried when she lost her \u201cadult\u201d coloring book, couldn\u2019t finish cosmology school, thinks selling candles on ETSY is a \u201csolid business idea\u201d, has never once in 3 years of dating cooked a meal, literally doesn\u2019t clean and bounces between minimum wage jobs... Not so sure she\u2019s mom material my dude.I do t know about that. My BF\u2019s son got his GF pregnant when they were 18. They are the best parents I have ever met.I\u2019ll never forget the day a 17 year old girl said to me \u201cwell, if I\u2019m old enough to have sex then I\u2019m old enough to take care of a baby\u201d and I died a little inside because the two are not mutually assured.Except no. \nI had a baby. At 19. Planned. And married. We\u2019re not all the same.You've just explained AlabamaNot a true at all. A lot of young people opt out of the baby having thing because they know they'll make bad parents due to emotional dysfunction, rage issues, poor health or economic circumstances, lack of focus on priorities etc.  \n\n\nThink of it this way; If someone told you \"I never went to flight school because I'd make a horrible pilot due to poor nerves, bad eyesight and a fear of heights.\" and someone next to the two of you said \"Being so self aware and knowing those pitfalls means **you'd be a better pilot** than someone who **did** go to flight school!\" would you think they're right? NO! You'd think of them as a goddamned idiot and you're be correct to do so.But it's ok if the 19 year old got raped and live in some shithole where access to abortion or even decent sex ed is near impossible? They wouldn't be a bad person then, would they?\n\nLike, are we passing judgement based on our idealised notions of the world or on actual people with complex lives and context we can't really hope to fathom?Yeah lets shame teen momsShut the fuck upRaise the water temperature. I think your brain might've frozen.[deleted][deleted]Much wisdom this shower thought has.One of the best shower thoughts in quite some time because overpopulation is a very real problemThe Breeder's ParadoxHow can you judge about how good a young woman can take care of her baby. What a stupid idea. Who is upvoting such bullshit???This post is wack lol. A 19 year old can have self awareness to not have a baby yet still have one on accident due to lack of planned parent hood and other things. You should slap urself in the shower instead lmao[deleted]Low IQ people are much more likely to reproduce. It's how the Republicans continue to stay viable.[deleted]This post is timed so perfectly. A kid that i went to highschool with (same age as me, i\u2019m 20) announced yesterday he\u2019s having a kid. Dudes been kicked out of his house multiple times and doesnt have a job, but he\u2019s having a child w his girlfriend of 1 year.\n\nGod help that child.\n\nEdit: sorry wait, he\u2019s a soundcloud rapper, my b. So he\u2019s obviously raking in cash (sarcasm intended)Maybe true, but probably not.  Plenty of teenagers end up being great parents and raising good people.  OP is forever alone.A girl at my school is pregnant she's 17 all I can think is \"hon you mean well but everything is gonna be crappy all the time\"More kids = less intelligence \n\nPretty soon the world will only have stupid people.An 18 year old with the maturity to question our foreign wars would probably be a better soldier than a MAGA 18 year old that can\u2019t wait to sign up.Yes I\u2019m sure there is 1 person from 1 group than 1 person from another group\u2026I\u2019m a 21 year old parent. She got pregnant while on birth control (it can happen) I\u2019ve always considered myself responsible and am saving up to buy a house. Just because someone is a young parent doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t responsible. Life kicks the shit out of everyone, you just have to handle what you\u2019re given.Lol how does shit like this get upvoted? \"A responsible person would probably take better care of a baby than an irresponsible person\"As I always say, \"The best parents, aren't.\"Well obviously... This isn't much of a shower thought as much as it's an obvious statement.Of course, accidents do happen to the best of us.If you don\u2019t know what to do while you are pregnant with a baby please consider adoption or drop it off anonymously at a police station, fire station, hospital, or for God\u2019s sake somewhere safeMight be the most ignorant statement I\u2019ve seen in at least 50 years. Have you met any mothers of a new born?Im not ugly, I'm responsible.If you\u2019re married, a 19 year old couple can take care of a baby. Not saying that all doThis is such an arrogant self-important take.\n\n'Self awareness not to have a baby' \ud83d\ude44Incorrect.... children are blessings and that means its time for you to change and accept responsibility for your child... instead of abort your baby and be filled with dark and sadness... I became a mom at 20 was I perfect no but who is... love that boy best thing that happened in my life and I honestly am better off than the majority of my friends that waited (spent more time partying and wasting time) ... not hating on those that choose not to but seriously sick of people hating on people who take on the responsibility...Yup, the paradox of human development. All the wrong people are having all the kids.As somebody who had their baby at 19, this post bothers me. I maybe understand the logic behind it, but I believe it is inaccurate. Obviously it will sometimes be the case but as with anything.\n\nI believe I took better care of my son at 19 than many older parents, I worked 2 jobs to provide for him and he never went without- you could even call him spoiled. My son was and always will be well loved and cared for and it would be the same if I had been even younger!Routine preventative vasectomies for most 13 year old boys. They're reversible and it's easy to store sperm for the occasional complication. Deal with the issue at the seed. Of course it would mean some discussions about male bodily autonomy so I'm not hopeful. But it would completely solve this issue.\n\nAlso no one is impressed with all the \"love\" some have for unplanned pregnancy except other stupid people back justifying their own dysfunctional family systems. Stigma against those girls is because those girls are too stupid and come from families too stupid to prepare them and support them in real ways, and then some bullshit emotional band aid gets slapped on the Lil mommy once she ruined at least two lives... Because what if she had to realize she's a terrible mother?! Oh no! Women deal with say much shame! We'd better protect her ego and perpetuate the system. \n\nI am pro-abortion: it's the responsible choice. Let's see who wants to shame me about that? Meanwhile I'm a meanie bc I do look down on women who keep their teen pregnancies. Go to therapy for your low self esteem. It's not my problem. It is your kid's problem that you're not good enough. And by the way, an anecdotal example of it being possible to do an adequate job doesn't out weigh the likely outcome that teen parents are not up to the task. No it's not evolution; it's not the perpetuation of the species. Miracles are not abused children suffering from willful ignorance and \"fake it til I make it that's what all parents are doing!\"\n\nLet the downvotes begin!I feel like this goes for any age group in the current climate tbh.It's a sad fact of earth based life, but evolution doesn't care about any given generation. In fact while the second 19 year old might have a slim chance of never getting to procreate, due to something unfortunate happening to them before they get the chance to, the creation of a new generation improves the chances of the first one's linage weathering unfavorable circumstances, or eventually evolving past them if the tendency of rapid procreation gets passed on. \n\nEven if it may offend out modern sensibilities, there is usually a reason behind why we evolved in the myriad of different ways we did.This might be the stupidest one yet. So now we're assuming that pregnant teenagers are not responsible because they got pregnant?Spoken like a person who has no kids... you can be 40 and not know what to do with the first kid.  No matter what age you are you love you child and treat that person how you want to be treated and hope for the best...Well first of all being childfree is evil. \n\nBut I like your username.You know jack shit! My little sister had her first child at 18 and is such a good mum she is my role model for motherhood.So sick of this exact same kind of post blowing up.  We get it, you're very smart for not having children.I would like to get you pregnant to test this out.Yeah? And what are you gonna do about it? Punk.Not even remotely true........That\u2019s making a lot of assumptions. Kinda like how I\u2019ll assume that someone who doesn\u2019t have kids would make a comment like this.Yet another reason we are truly evolving into a species of morons, the morons breed in shorter generations and produce more of themselves.Said and agreed upon by some other 19 year olds.\n\nThe reason most of y\u2019all won\u2019t have kids at 19 isn\u2019t because you\u2019re self aware, it\u2019s because you couldn\u2019t get a woman to fuck you if your life depended on it. Not having opportunity isn\u2019t an exercise in self-control.I think this applies to merely some cultures, not all.[deleted]Probably not. 19 years is a great age to have children. Sorry about your wage slavery.19 years old is a good age to have a child actually.The irony.It\u2019s not 100% either or but having a kid and taking care of it for the majority of its and yours lives is a real test of your metal Regardless of your maturity level age or place in Society.How sway, and what are you talking about.TrueThe very premise of Idiocracy...Wouldn\u2019t the 19 year old with a baby have the hindsight to know they shouldn\u2019t have had the baby then have the self awareness of the other 19 year old? Thus making it equal in the quality?I agree. This feels like a reframing of statements my 19 year old girlfriend (a mother) would say: \"My daughter has changed my life, and taught me so much.\" \n\nShe's 41 now, we're no longer together but we keep in touch. Yes, she learned some life lessons of consequences from her daughter; but she also held/holds a grudge against her daughter for teaching that life lesson. She recognizes but struggles to accept responsibility for her own actions.People who dont want the job are the best ones suited for it.Ah, The mtv Teen Mom ParadoxOne of life\u2019s many ironiesAnd hence the paradox of humanity's inexorable drift toward IdiocracyOnly stupid people are breeding. . . \n\nWould make a great song.Idiocracy made some really good points on this subject.Fergie actually spent a lot of buzz.Guy who had a kid at 19 here. By 22 I was married with two....yeah I know guys. I was wild. I wasn\u2019t ready.... not even slightly. 23 years later. That kid is graduating college next month and moving to some fancy building in sf financial district on the 31st floor. My second kid ( my son) just bought a brand 2021 new car. Is a sophomore in college. Has 3 bank accounts and already invests in his Roth. \n\nSome people say \u201c why buy a new car\u201d. I\u2019m just proud he did it himself. No co signer. When I was his age 20, I had to buy diapers. When my father was 20 he had to buy diapers. When my grandfather was 20 he had to buy diapers.  My son broke the line. He got a car and he apparently knows how to use condoms!I feel called outI\u2019ve always said that the best leaders don\u2019t want to be. This general principle of self-awareness and frailty is crucial for maintaining humanity.I dunno, I certainly had the awareness not have a kid, despite being dumb enough to marry young. The reason I knew not to have a kid is because of all the attention they need. \n\nI can't say if you would have gave me a kid I would have done well on just that knowledge alone.I listened to a podcast and bill nye said basically that, that the poorest parts of the world need Internet to educate their women because educated women have less babies and take better care of the ones they do have.I'm 21, am 100% sure i cannot possibly take care of a baby right now or anytime soon, nor even fulfill a partner emotionally for the time being, but i'm far from being a responsible person.\n\nI think it's just a question of having a minimum of common sense and taking time to question yourself about it, not a question of being responsible or not, imo of course.You have limits?Counter arguement is that people who want to do something vs people that don't might be better at it too.  19 year olds can handle kids fine, it's not ideal but people often think \"well I couldn't do it at 19 other people probably shouldn't.\" \n\nI remember handling detonating and removing and disabling IEDs at 22 years old and my first deployment at 19. When I got out at 25 and was working in construction they wouldn't let a 19 year old flag traffic because it was too much responsibility. \n\nId rather a parent that wanted me than a parent that was just forced to have me.Are you saying I can\u2019t live my life with a YOLO mentality?? You absolute madman.This is the premise of Idiocracy.Buncha people I know who were freshly out of HS/College freshman with kids.\n\nI think probably only one or two of them are genuinely doing \u201cfine.\u201d Y\u2019know, no job, no spouse, an overexaggerated amount of social media posts about how no one can touch their kids except them, etc. I\u2019m 23 and even before now I\u2019ve never even thought I could manage kids, and I\u2019ve got a decent enough background and home life to easily support them. It makes me sad because catching up with these people.. they sound like theyre trying to act excited. I legit met one of my friends I talked to a lot in HS working at a pharmacy next to my house, started talking about the time its been and what I\u2019ve done. Asked her what shes been up to \u201c..Well.. I\u2019m pregnant. Thats it.\u201d\n\n\u201c..oh!\u201d\n\n\u201c..yeah.\u201dBut eventually, only irresponsible people will have babies and the population will get more and more dumb.I knew I wasn't ready for college at 18 so I went in the Navy.  Some adult told me that because I thought that I was actually ready for college.  Glad I did what I did.  My life went very well because of the Navy.My best friend had a baby at 16. Her son is 13 now. She has a wonderful platonic relationship with her kids dad (just a year older and also one of my good friends) and he has always kept them as a priority and even coaches the youth hockey team. She is in a loving long term relationship and has a great job managing an npr station. I think some people judge really quickly and don\u2019t think about the resilience of all women and what goes into making these decisions. \n\nI think the reason these women struggle so badly is the stigma and judgment from society.You have consequences?Yep, super irresponsible but I'm smart enough to get a vasectomy. \n\nBabies are a responsibility I neither want nor could handle.OLG Lottery, know your limits, play within it.1000% I'm 33 and will never be well off enough to have children so I have accepted that I will never have my own. But I know I'd be great parent with love and life lessons. Maybe one day I can foster or adopt but not until I know they could have a good life.I see this all the time where I live, but with dogs, rather than babies. People seem to get dogs as some kind of fashion accessory because their friends have them. Some have ended up pretty neglected and other people have had to step in and help out. People see me out walking my friend's dog all the time and tell me I should get a dog but I know there is a world of difference between taking Chuck for a walk in the woods on a sunny day and the actual responsibility of looking after him 24/7. I looked after another dog when he was a puppy whenever his owner was at work and he would not stop barking for attention. I don't know how I'd deal with that if I had to deal with it day in, day out.I'm so confused by this family linei had to read that comment 4 times, finally got it. i think.\n\nyou are calling your cousin's child your niece? right?I can't tell if this is one of those \"family wreath\" situationsI\u2019m concerned that this is gonna be my step daughter. When I say this isn\u2019t fair on her mum of me, I\u2019ll be called selfish.it might be better off that wayMy dad grew up very close to his cousins, so their children (my 2nd cousins once removed) were more like nieces and nephews to my dad and like cousins to me. I get everyone's familial nitpicking, but your comment makes perfect sense to me.The few people I knew personally as teen moms definitely treated their kids more like nuisance little siblings. Like did you just whine to your mom about something the baby messed up?My parents raised 3 of the 4 of my sisters kids, she had her 1st at 17.  Drugs tho.. It\u2019s a privilege to have children in my eyes. \ud83d\ude22I would actually love it if there was some survey that correlated how kids depict their grandparents (such as in drawings) to several factors such as location, income, etc.\n\nMy grandparents had my parents when they were in their 30s and my parents had me in their 30s, so my memories of my grandparents always were of an old, retired couple. However I have friends who's grandparents were in their 40s when they were born, and still went to work etc... Could be interesting.I have so many questions and so few answers>I guess I learned from my parents mistakes\n\nThat's the best we can hope to do. I feel like a lot of people are like \"Man my parents were awful. I'll show them that I can be a better parent than them!\" But then they of course tend to make the same sorts of mistakes as their parents did. It's how my parents were. The mentality seemed to always be \"well I'm no worse than my parents were, so it's fine.\" And then that just happens over and over throughout generations.I feel you a lot on the forgiveness part. Just kids having kids, I can\u2019t fathom how hard it must\u2019ve been with three kids under 5 before 25, living several states away from our closest familyVery interesting take. Got me thinking about my own family structure. My parents had me at age 23. I\u2019m 24 now so I can kind of imagine where they were at in life, back then, now that I\u2019ve reached their ageSome people just can\u2019t look beyond the surface. It sucks.But the question is why were the guys at pharmacy telling you all this? They are not your parents or something?I hear all these stories of people becoming teen parents but I have never meet one. I don't live in a gated community either. I went to public school, had friends who weren't rich.My friend's sister got pregnant a little on the early side.  The kid is fine.  It's just that everyone needs to pitch in to care for the baby, including my friend and my friend's mom.That\u2019s small town America culture right there. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re done with high school, time to get married and have a baby\u201dIs your ex classmate my aunt?That irks me to the core, I had my daughter at 19 (I'm the dad) I dropped out of college and started working to support the family. No time for partying etc. Now at the ripe old age of 24 I've got a solid career and a 5yo, the others I know who were in my situation are still partying like they're in high-school doing nothing with their kids.Came to say this. People that would make society better by having children tend to have less, and ignorant assholes who fill the world with stupidity have a million kidsWelcome to Costco, I love you[Relavant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/603/)\n\nThe main problem is that things such as \"good\" can't be defined so any plan to prevent social decline end up being a eugenics program.I like that one!I'm so sick of hearing about this movie and all the little new eugenicists it createdI remember that documentaryI think that being aware you can't take care of a baby means you'll seek out the appropriate advice to learn how to take care of a baby if you were in that situation.\n\nHere's a secret some older adults won't tell you. Even thirty-year-olds having their first child have no clue how to take care of a baby. They just (hopefully) seek out advice and figure it out as they go.I cant even take care of myself axaxazHello there, am a parent who had kids at 19! And this is the correct answer here.\n\nWe were definitely not super responsible to have kids, but our oldest just turned 18, is graduating high school, never been in trouble, and is going to college next year. More importantly, she's an amazing human and is compassionate beyond belief.\n\nFuck this thread and anyone shitting on people who have kids young. They can all kindly eat a bag of dicks.Absolutely. I had a classmate that had a kid at 19. The couple got married and from the outside,  it looked they were struggling to made a good life out of what happened. A few years later, they had another kid. At night, they did online college classes and got degrees. Now we are all in the mid-30s and they live in an amazing house and have a perfect looking life. Their house is nicer than the majority of people I know. The kids are in high school and should be out of the house when our friends are 40. It's not all bad and a hard life can make diamonds.Hi! I'm another parent who had kids at 19. Was a single mom for a little while I went back to college. Paid for daycare myself and never asked my family to babysit. I am 27 now, I graduated, I hold a steady career, I'm married, and I have completed our family with two other kids since. We own our own home and vehicles. Was it a smart move to have kids at 19?? No. It was an accident. I would absolutely not recommend having children at 19. But you are so right!!! Some people just have to make the choice to grow up when they make mistakes.I\u2019m not 19 anymore but I still would have thrown it back at em. NO!Sooooo.... Under this scheme if you don't want to look after a baby at 19..... Have a baby?This is the way.Mom, you have a new kid to take care off.\n\n-mei mean, this really wouldn\u2019t be helping the gene pool in the long runWhy would you wreck a responsible 19 year old financially because of the othersFuck. Time to have a quick baby thenBut you already know the 19 year olds who have kids breed like rats. Theyre just gonna have another one in 9 monthsThe whole reason this concept works is because the 19 year olds without babies don't have any right away or as frequently. I'm not sure your solution would work.That'll just lead to the irresponsible people making more babies since they will completely avoid consequences.So did my parents and grandparents.  Unfortunately, between the dramatically higher barrier of entry to well-paying jobs and higher cost of living overall, it's much more of a terrible decision today than 24 years ago.My wife had a baby at 19 while on birth control (doesn't always work) and I became his step father when he was 4 and I was 23.\n\nHe's going on 16 now, has always made honor roll, pretty much swept the awards for academics and athletics at his school, we've shelled out piles of money on travel hockey for him, etc.\n\nI personally think both sides have pros and cons. Our situation for example has been far more precarious financially than if we were older but I've always been one of the few dads who could actually keep up with the kids. If I had been older I dont think I could have spent hours playing goalie against him at night so that he could practice.\n\nBut in the end, being young doesn't make you a bad parent. Being selfish does.That's always been my thoughts on it. \n\nI'm 38 with no kids, and I couldn't imagine having them 10 or 20 years ago, but at the same time I would have developed very differently through my 20s (or 30s for that matter) if I'd had a child. \n\nI wouldn't have done half, or maybe any, of the dumb shit over the years if a kid was involved. Wouldn't take anything back, but I'd be a totally different person.I like to think that 90% of teenagers who get pregnant accidentally suck it up and grow up quickly and end up at least being decent parents.People that don't want to be politicians would probably make better politicians.Harry Potter was good at saving the world cause he just wanted to be Harry PotterThere's a neat book with this concept where humanity has overcome Death. Like it's nearly impossible to die at all anymore. So they set up a group of people called Scythes that are tasked with killing people at the same rate people would naturally die. When a Scythe kills someone, they aren't allowed to be \"Regenerated\" (brought back to life). If the people refuse to be killed (as they do it out in public at random) they subject their entire family to death. Now there are Scythes that enjoy killing people, and do it at a way higher rate and sadistically too. So they whole series is about the Scythes who don't enjoy killing people trying to stop the sadistic ones. The best Scythes are the ones that didn't want to be one in the first place.omgThank you so much for pointing this out. Age is not an indicator of whether you will do your best to love and care for your children. My parents had both myself and my brother before my mom hit 20 and they have been amazing parents. \n\nMy friend was a late in life, planned and hoped for child. And her mom was a narcissistic idiot who traumatized my friend.Those who crave power don\u2019t deserve it.This. And I honestly believe that no one is prepared to be a parent until they actually have a screaming newborn in their hands. Be you 17 or 40, parenting is unlike anything else. It's not the same as a puppy or babysitting. The only way to experience parenting is to be a parent.right?  \"people who are better at things are better at things\" lmaoSame with adopting. It is incredibly expensive and they would not let in many cases people adopt for things like marital status or for being a same sex couple, but if you are a drug addict who fucks another deadbeat and have 6 babies, nobody would bat an eye.I totally understand your point, but what's the alternative? How do you decide who's responsible enough to be a parent and who isn't? Through government ran testing? LOL. What will you do to those that get pregnant but aren't able to pass whatever test they have to take?The alternative as u/my_balls_your_mouth1 pointed out, is that the government will run the testing to determine who is fit to reproduce. That\u2019s another way to say forced adoptions (see genocide of native Americans in Canada), or forced sterilization (see going genocide in China). \n\nWe rightly chose the lesser of two evils and decided that controlling sex and reproduction aren\u2019t worth the trade offs of essentially allowing us to be one step away from genocide or class suppression.\n\nThe problem is less who gets to reproduce, but more what to do with the children after they\u2019re born. Let\u2019s fix the education system first\u2014 a robust methodologically and statistically robust study in the 1960s following kids for a lifetime found that for every $1 spent in quality childhood education, [it nets a return of $4-9 on average](https://www.impact.upenn.edu/early-childhood-toolkit/why-invest/what-is-the-return-on-investment/) and has better impact on quality of life and health. \n\nWe don\u2019t need to fix who gets to reproduce, we need to promote equity in childhood education.Monkey see, Monkey do.Well considering how hard birth control and being able to get sterilized is, its almost like the government wants unwanted teen pregnancy. Not to mention, in the US, sex educations isn't standardized which means some girls get horrible sex education. But sure blame the teenagers.Ah yes, I\u2019d love the government being allowed to forbid people from having kidsForced abortions and sterilization, what great ideas /s (sarcasm tag is necessary because most of the folks in this thread seem like they'd be gung ho about the idea)Tbf driving a car is a societal privilege\n\nHaving a child is a biological right\n\nIt sucks that the dumbest people end up reproducing like rats, but it would be pretty abhorrent to limit the bodily autonomy of these people. It would essentially mimic Jim Crow lawsThis entire thread is psychotic. Yeah loads of 19 year olds want to be parents. It takes a 10 second fuck up during a time where young people are messing around.Lots of birth control options in the worldr/holupDamnHe\u2019s not wrong. He\u2019s just an a$$hole.Whereas I agree this is odd, there is a reason the second girl was an emancipated minor. The court deemed she lacked a parent that would have her best interest in mind, and or have the responsibility to make an appropriate decision.\n\nMy point being that the ability to sign their own waiver was not dependent on their own level of responsibility, but that of their parents'.I agree.\n\nYou are either taking a care of a baby or not.   \nIn most case however, the 19-year old will have about 9 months to prepare (up to a certain level).[removed]The timing of both posts is pretty condemningThis comment is just a variation on threads title and just as weirdly ego trippy and judgemental.How does that statement make any sense? If you know your limits and know you can\u2019t care for a child... then how do you know \u201cfor damn sure\u201d that you\u2019d make a better parent than people who are already doing exactly what you admit you can\u2019t?Idk..but i hope i dont find outYou know, I really thought that when I get older I will be good at taking care of plants. Thanks for smashing my dreams haha.Guess where I thought of it.Why is this controversial?Not sure you read it correctly.funny way of saying virginI had my kids early. No, I do not hate myself. I would hate being 40 and running around a playground. I would hate being in my mid-50s and dealing with teenagers. I would hate being 60 or 70 when my kid gets married. I would hate not knowing my grandchildren like my parents know my children. \nDid we sacrifice the \"good times\" people have when they're young? No. We just shifted them. I'll be 38 when my youngest graduates from high school. I've learned that no one is TRULY prepared for parenting until they actually become a parent. \nAlso, my case may be a little different. I married their father. He was an incredibly hard worker who provided very well for us. I was able to stay home and go to college. My children grew up seeing their father work, their mother study and then much later work. We had all of the support we needed from our families. I fully understand that that's not always the case. At the end of the day, the love you show a child outweighs so many other elements. Love your kid, no matter how old you are.Then that\u2019s not the person that the OP is thinking about with this post*probably*What 19 year old is going to have a good stable income these days\n>You have zero idea what it's like to have to step up to the level of responsibility required to be a single parent, making sacrifice after sacrifice to support the little person you've made. \nInstead, you sit on your high horse judging anyone who doesn't follow the same life path as you, most likely because they haven't been given the privileges and opportunities you have. \n\nIf you take the same person at say... 18 and at 28, the person at 28 will have finished their education, have a good job, and have the additional experience with life which would allow them to do a much better job taking care of the baby. Heck, their job might even provide paid maternity leave. \n\nMeanwhile that same person at 18 would have to juggle school, work, and taking care of the baby. The job would pay less, the eventual school grades will be lower, and there will be less time to spend with the baby due to having to do school/work in addition to taking care of the baby. \n\nIt's not that some CAN'T pull it off, but it's just better to do it when you are already established, rather than rushing it.wow, do you walk around angry all day?Neither of those even combined is 100%Five Guys'll charge you 11.That's actually a good question.  In this thread, I've stated that, yes, that does matter a lot.  Things are different in certain states and countries.  This is why I'm pro-choice and pro-education.  Many accuse me of being judgmental, but I don't care when other people have kids.  This is a belief that informs my own decisions.Yes let's absolutely shame them. Most of the people who do this are generational unemployed breeders who contribute naff all to society. Just like their parents and just like their parents before them.[deleted]Umm what does that have to do with feminism? And also, the same goes for me and I'm a guy, if my partner had a kid at 19 I would not be ready at all for it, neither would they. as much someone thinks they are ready for a kid at 19, most would not be equipped, there are special circumstances where if you raised a younger sibling for many years then you have experience, but how many teens actually have that experience, not many.gtfo natalist, also the \u201cbiological clock\u201d is a myth, and even if it wasn\u2019t men have just as much of a want to reproduce as women. not all women want to reproduce, and by not reproducing they are doing good for humanity by not forcing existence onto another human being when there are thousands of kids alive who need homes.> is NOT deluded from the most recent lunacy that turned women into lesser men, thanks to feminism, being mentally teenagers after age 20, unable to have relationships or to understand the concept of biological clock, completely caught in narcissistic infantile thinking centering on personal pleasure, caught in exhibitionist self-objectification for superficial feelings of power and casual, meaningless sex.\n\nlol what incel drivel is this?Being a parent is incredibly expensive and a huge responsibility.  Most 19 year olds are not equiped for the task financially or developmentally.  The 19 year old who realizes they are unprepared has shown better judgement than the 19 year old who, by underestimating the magnitude of the task, thinks they are ready.School can be almost a full time job. A full time job is a full time job. And taking care of a child is also a full time job.\n\nHow do you expect someone to combine all three and provide a good support for the baby? Typically people shouldn't have kids before they are done their education, and have a good financial situation where they aren't trying to juggle things that are all effectively full time jobs.\n\nWhile theoretically doable, it's NOT a good idea and many cannot do it.I see a lot of similar reasoning now. Mostly from people who don\u2019t want children at all. Claiming that they are the type of people that should be reproducing. Like they\u2019re somehow the \u2018elite\u2019 in society. Comparing their own imagined reproductive fitness and parenting ability to, you know, people with actual real life kids.That's not what they said dummy.R/wooshThey are actually dying. White people will be minority soon. One of the reason republicans keep acting up.That's what ur m0m said about uOr abort itIf 't be true you\u2019re did marry, a 19 year fusty couple can taketh care of a baby.  Not declaring yond all doth\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`[deleted]Nope, this shower \u201cthought\u201d is just a display of cognitive bias. It\u2019s probably the stupidest fucking thing I\u2019ve read in my life. The person who has \u201cself awareness to not want kids\u201d holy Jesus banana Christ  does this scream egocentric condescensionCongratulations, you appear to be the reason the post has the word \"probably\" in it. Nevertheless, you are the exception, not the rule.[deleted]\n>Spoken like a person who has no kids... you can be 40 and not know what to do with the first kid.  No matter what age you are you love you child and treat that person how you want to be treated and hope for the best...\n\nYou can be 40 and not know sure.\n\nBut if you keep all other factors exactly the same, it's still better to have a kid later in life than when you're a teenager. Not having school, having an established job, and having more life experience is better no matter how you look at it.\n>You know jack shit! My little sister had her first child at 18 and is such a good mum she is my role model for motherhood.\n\nGood for her. But wouldn't her life been better if she had her kid after finishing school and having an established job? So she didn't have to juggle so many things? And when she had a bit more life experience? Would those extra few years to establish herself not made her even better?\"I think it's just a question of having a minimum of common sense and taking time to question yourself about it, not a question of being responsible or not, imo of course.\"\n\nThats what being responsible is mostly about. Taking the time to think about and knowing your limits. \n\nThe next step is just learning how to and then actually compensating for your limits when youre required to do something that requires a skill youre weaker in. \n\nGetting older makes me being responsible easier. You (usually) have more practice, you have more knowledge, your brain is less jacked up on hormones and is more developed. But getting older doesnt make you more responsible. That requires work. \n\nSo good news youre probably on the higher end of responsible for a 21 year old in your situation. Even if it isnt \"that\" responsible.You're responsible. Maybe not for a 50 year old, but it sounds like you're on top of being 21.I\u2019m 28 and I\u2019m pretty sure I can\u2019t look after a baby. I often wonder why my gen and GenZ are having less babies. Main reason is money but I feel the other is so many of us had such shit childhoods and wouldn\u2019t want to wish that on someone else.FWIW, no one who hasn't taken care of a baby before is capable of taking care of a baby. It's something you learn little by little when the necessity arises.27 and it\u2019s weird to think that I\u2019m older than when my mom had my brother and I. I barely have the mental energy to care for myself, let alone a partner AND kid. I don\u2019t know how she did it, especially being a single mom at the time.30 here... I think I COULD do it, because I\u2019m always ready to step to the plate and work hard. That said, HELL NO! I can barely clean my house consistently. I don\u2019t plan to wipe a baby\u2019s ass and care for them. I want to feel confident I\u2019m fine before I think of a childI\u2019m 34 and would struggle with having a baby to care for. I hold small pillows over my ovaries to muffle their screams.I'm 42 and know I'm not responsible enough to have a child.It\u2019s also about resources. When my dad was my age, he had way more income, way more wealth, and had just married my mom. Their marriage was horrible and only lasted 18 years. While I\u2019ve definitely learned a lot of lessons from their mistakes, I\u2019ve come to accept that I will probably never have children because I can\u2019t see myself affording it, let alone having the time.Yes I agree. Getting through life knowing you shouldn\u2019t be having babies until you can afford them financially and emotionally is the BARE minimum. Makes me wonder what exactly is the rock bottom of responsibility when the bar is so lowIt's also not allowing your ego to overtake reason. There's a lot of 15-28yos who think they're invincible and don't consider they're consequences despite being responsible. There was a college student who died recently from Covid that infamously posted back on July that it was an \"old person\" concern and that anyone under 30 should be allowed to do what they want. Ego overpowers our common sense and reason far more often than we think.And on the other hand I think also even responsible people make mistakes and end up in not ideal circumstances. I mean no contraception is 100% effective, so any sexualy active heterosexual has a chance of getting pregnant.Are you meThe problem is that \u201ccommon sense\u201d is not as common as it should be.\"Being self aware doesn't mean you're responsible\"\n\n-Master Oogway or some shit idkI turned 30 this year and there\u2019s no way I could care for an infant. I can barely take care of myself. I have been caring for my dad after he got out of the hospital from a bad stroke and a fall so that\u2019s kinda like taking care of a baby.Actually you sound more responsible than half of our elected leaders. Don't doubt yourself so much.\n\nAnd for the record nobody should ever tell you when you are ready to be a parent, or anything else. This is your life.\n\nAlso nobody ever feels prepared to \"have\" a baby. It'll throw a monkey wrench into all of your plans for your future. Then you will grow and change and evolve and look back realizing that you wouldn't change all those bumps in the road that got you to today.\n\nDo u. Do what makes u happy. You may only get once chance to be here.100% sure...don't be ridiculous. You are capable of much more than you can imagine.You may think that, but the thing about having a baby is, it's real, it is totally dependent on you, it's yours, and there isn't really any other option but to devote yourself to it for about 15 years. So you do, and you end up being better at it than you otherwise would have suspected. \nSource: Am a Dad of two, when I held the first one it scared the shit out of me, but now I'm actually a pretty good involved Dad.I was having this conversation with my Dad the other day and it made me think differently.\n\nBasically, a baby can save you. You just get your shit together and figure it out because you have this life to provide for and protect.\n\nI'm almost 30 and I was just venting that I'm not as ahead in life as I would like. Jobs fine, no house though... Shits expensive, want a kid.\n\nHe laughed at me and was like you are doing better than I was at your age and I had you at 25. Guess what, I had to figure out how to be successful real quick and I did.We all do.I suppose they would only be able to answer that if they were one of said responsible peopleBatman has no limits.That's really what it comes down to: if the parents sincerely want to have a kid together, they'll probably be better parents than most whether they're 19 or 39.Parents can't necessarily handle kids at 19. A lot of people are better off experiencing some amount of adult life before they they try to raise a kid, vs trying to figure out adulthood with a kid in tow. I've been around a lot of people that couldn't handle kids in their early twenties and split, so now their kids are growing up in a broken home, no matter how good the people are as t being parents. A lot of people who waited until their late twenties are a lot better at being in a relationship and raising kids, so overall I think it's a better situation all around.Depends on how you interpret you only live once. \n\nI see it as I only get one life I better not fuck it up.You can! Also, you can live your life with a \"Shoot at cops with a vodka-filled water-pistol\" mentality (but you'd better make the most of it because you'll only do it once)You can if you\u2019re responsible and think about your actions.Knew it wouldn't take long to find thisCarl\u2019s Jr. *FUCK YOU!* I\u2019m eating.The future is now.I know that was the premise to Idiocracy, but it doesn't really make sense: We might not be afraid of getting eaten by tigers, but you still need to worry about that other walking-ape competing with you for food, shelter, and mates.My sister was pregnant at 19 and had her baby at 20 with a not so great guy. My nephew is 10 now. My sister was not in a good place before he was born but my parents helped my sister out a lot and I think she is an amazing mom now. She's married to a great guy and just gave birth to another baby boy. My first nephew definitely changed her entire life for the better in my opinion.Obviously your best friend is a great example of how well things can go. Yes I'm sure the judgment and stigma is incredibly difficult, too.\n\nBut realistically the reason these mothers struggle is probably because trying to get an education while trying to provide for a child on whatever wage a 16 year old earns, is essentially impossible. Unless you're lucky enough to have someone swoop in and either pay the bills, take care of the baby, or both.\n\nLet's just be real here lolgreat for her, still sucks for the kid[deleted]The niece is not taking care of the baby, her mother, the cousin of OP, is taking care of the baby.   \n   \n\n Edit; I can see now that everyone is misunderstanding that OP's niece is actually is their cousin-once removed. I am assuming that OP is close tho their cousin and is referring to their cousin the law in a familiar fashion, similar to how I call my mother's best friend 'auntie'.In families where the extended family is close it's not that uncommon to call anyone in the generation older than you (parents generation) aunt/uncle and anyone in the generation younger than you neice/nephew. I'm in one of those types of families and it's a lot simpler to just say that rather than \"my cousin's kid but we are close so basically my nephew.\"They are using niece to refer to their cousins kid.I think they refer to \"niece\" as cousin's child rather than a brother or sister's child. \n\nSo its: Cousin -> \"niece\" (19) -> baby.My mom once tried to convince me to have a baby by saying that I can give the baby to her for a couple years to raise till I\u2019m ready to be a mom. I was like \u201cwhat. the. hell. mom???\u201d That\u2019s when I learned that my mom was raised by my great grandmother till age 5 because my grandma was an even bigger POS than I knew her to be and couldn\u2019t give two shits about my mom\u2019s wellbeing. Mom was like \u201cand I turned out just fine!\u201d No mom, no you didn\u2019t. \n\nI do have a baby now, much later and completely unrelated to my mom\u2019s nagging. Love my baby girl to death.I feel like parents try really hard to not go wrong the same way their parents did, but usually end up being bad in other areas. \n\nFor example my grandmother would go through my mothers room regularly, reading her notes, and they had a cleaner who would move things around in her room too. So she\u2019s really insecure about any sort of snooping through things. She once shouted at me for cleaning the kitchen and accused me of snooping for temporarily moving a pile of junk mail to clean the surface underneath. My mum is really good at giving privacy when it comes to our living space. However she took away my privacy in other ways when I was a teenager by tracking my phone and wanting to know every detail of my plans when socialising. I couldn\u2019t really do anything spontaneous and ended up hiding a lot of things from her. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll be like if I ever become a parent, I probably won\u2019t invade my kids privacy so much. But I wonder what area I\u2019ll fail in. It\u2019s hard to be a perfect parentI was the hippy kid or edgy kid in school. In a small town that gets you side ways looks. But whatever. I\u2019m 32 now and I\u2019ve seen some amazing things in my life. I\u2019ve met some cool people and I\u2019ve experienced things that 99% of people from bumfuck, TN never have. I never cared what they thought then and I I sure af don\u2019t care now.Small town. Knowing everyone\u2019s business and giving unsolicited advice is a big hobbyCraaazy. We had one school system for our entire county. I graduated with 98 people. At the time of graduation we had about 5-6 girls who were pregnant. That doesn\u2019t include the girls who had babies before graduation and it doesn\u2019t include the boys who had got girl in other grades pregnant. I also knew these twin girls who had 6 kids between the 2 of them at the time they would have graduated if they had not dropped out of school.Having sex ed makes a huuuge difference. My graduating class had only one teen pregnancy (she gave birth a week before graduation), but other schools in this region that didn\u2019t teach it had a way higher rate. My school stopped teaching it, and I\u2019m worried for those kids.Out of curiosity, when did you start and end highschool? It seems like teen pregnancy has been dropping over the past couple decades as teens have been able to look up the info gated away in the \"sex ed\" classes, which as more like \"why you should never have sex\" ed classes.Had our first kid at 20, wife was 18.  We had no support from family and had to scrape by, with me working 2 jobs so she could stay home.  It was rough, but we slowly pulled ourselves out of poverty.  Now, both kids are on their own and now older than we were when we had them.  One is in a relationship but doesn't want kids of his own.I mean that's true of any family. Raising children  is incredibly difficult  and usually benefits from having friends and family willing to help out.Dood tell me about it. I\u2019m 32 now and my entire family is beside themselves bc I don\u2019t have a man or a kid. They even starting to mention getting a sperm donor!Biggest idiot I ever worked with had 4 kids with 2 baby mommas and lived with his parents at 34 with no money.The inevitable conclusion of this line of thought is that eugenics is necessary.\n\nIt's a very complicated issue. The principle behind eugenics isn't *all* bad, but it inevitably conflicts with individual rights. And determining who deserves what will always involve bias and subjectivity.\n\nFor example, one could argue that people who have disproportionate numbers of children are effectively infringing on the lives and rights of other humans since we live on a world of finite capacity and resources. Again, not as simple of an argument as people make it out to be.\n\nI suspect the proliferation of genetic engineering will help drag these issues back into the spotlight in a way. People will try to remove perceived negative traits, even before birth. It's not so different from eugenics, just in a refined form. Imagine if we found a way to prevent people from being born gay or trans? In less accepting societies, you could see the lgbt community erased.It's because invariably, the responsible people have to choose to have lesser kids to accommodate for the stupid people's stupidity. Sucks to be honest.[deleted]Society should fund children more and give out free birth control. This would both decrease dumb people having them and increase smart people having them.Poverty is a helluva drug.I think I apply to this. I realize that I probably wouldn\u2019t be the best parent for kids, which somehow makes me self aware enough to maybe be good at parenting?>and ignorant assholes who fill the world with stupidity have a million kids\n\nSome ignorants assholes don't have kids at all, and some responsible people have a lot. It depends of the country and society you're in i guessI've been homeless, and I can't figure out.Yeah, I'm really sick of hearing this eugenics bullshit on literally every reddit post. It's founded on the assumption that stupid people always have equally stupid kids, and that is simply not the case. I'm living proof that we can be at least slightly less stupid!\n\nIt's easy to blame the parents if you assume everything is biology, but the real problem is our education system is terrible. Fun fact: if you teach kids better, they'll be able to think better. What a shock.Lol thank you for this. Idiocracy (which I have never seen in its entirety) appears to be a fun flick. It is also tailor-made for the reddit crowd, people whose purported intellectual superiority is a fundamental aspect of their identity and self-worthAlso, the premise of the movie ignores the fact that there's still selective pressure... *from other people.*\n\nSure, we might not be concerned that tigers will eat us in our sleep, but all the other upright-apes are still competing with you for food, shelter,  mates, etc.Most the people who have told me that Idiocracy is prophetic tend to be the types of people we'd see in idiocracy.It\u2019s what plants craveSeriously, it\u2019s such fuckin psuedo \u201cwaaaah waaah the world is bad and there\u2019s nothing you can do ^also ^poor ^people ^bad ^guys\u201dThis is so true. Even in my late 30\u2019s after all my research and classes, leaving the hospital with my firstborn infant was terrifying!Yep, and Google is one hell of a blessing. Just knowing you don't know is often enough for you to check Google, where you'll (usually) find a real answer.Had my first child just shy of 32. Had a breakdown the first night home with him. No one has any clue. None.I just had my first baby at 37 and I had no clue what I was doing at first. Yeah, you can read books and take classes... but in the end not a damn one helped. It\u2019s very much a \u201clearn as you go\u201d experience. If I had to do it all again, I\u2019d know more and be more calm less stressed mother to a newborn, but those first few weeks I swear to God I was googling \u201cis this normal\u201d like every five minutes.Well that\u2019s no good. You made it to Reddit! That\u2019s more than most people. You\u2019ve got access to the internet! There are so many 19 year olds that haven\u2019t even explored the internet.That\u2019s obviously great for you and your child, but the OP meant it as a generalization and is likely correct in their assertion. People shouldn\u2019t be absolutely shitting on kids who have babies young, but the warning remains. Financial and mental stability should come before having a kid and most 19 year olds do not have that. Yes you can step up upon learning you are having a child, but that doesn\u2019t dismiss the general ignorance behind getting pregnant in the first place at a point where you shouldn\u2019t be getting pregnant.Rugby style or QB style?As a current 19 year old I'd have to agree with youIt's clearly the responsible decision.[deleted]This is the May.You moms 19?Mom- I did such a good job with you another one will be EZ!A bit of an extreme study in nature vs nurture.>Why would you wreck a responsible 19 year old financially\n\nAnd emotionally.\n\nAnd professionally.\n\nAnd in health.\n\nAnd because reasons.\n\nAnd because it was a joke that was never meant to be taken seriously.That's absolutely true.  We were able to buy a house in our early 20s. Now that's practically impossible.Thinking about this fucks me up. If you're 25, you're at the age where you'd have had children already if you lived at basically any point in human history before the last half-century. Modernity fucking robbed us.That's really true. It was much easier a long time ago when one parent could provide for the whole family. I waited I was 28 to have my first child. It's still not easy of course sometimes but if I had a kid at 18 I wouldn't have been able to provide what I can now.The birth control pill is 99% effective IF USED CORRECTLY. People miss the second part and then blame the control.I had kids early, I was 20 when our first son was born.  I'm 46 and an empty-nester now.  My wife and I have been married the whole time as well, and we had no support from family either.  It was tough for a number of years financially, but the boys turned out pretty well.  I have high school classmates who have kids in elementary school, and I can't imagine having young children at my age now.  It's all down to one's perspective I suppose.I think it is true for most things that have big benefits like power, immunity, influence, time off, etc. Because people get those jobs for those without concern for the responsibilities you are supposed to uphold.I've been saying this for a few years now, politics should be like jury duty. You just get selected and you have to do a good job or you're immediately off the team. \n\nIt would fucking suck for those selected but would be good for society imo. I think people in general are good and honest but politicians are mostly psycho/sociopaths, so a random selection is the only way to avoid egomaniacs.\"The major problem\u2014one\u00a0of the major problems, for there are several\u2014one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.\nTo summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must\u00a0want\u00a0to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.\nTo summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.\" - Douglas Adams,\u00a0The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.I attended a lecture once that talked about how most mayors wouldn't be qualified to run a walmart but they run a city of 200k+ people. They also brought up that the average walmart manager makes more money and puts in about the same number of hours so there is no incentive for somebody to take their leadership skills from the corporate world and go into politicsI would also be good at saving the world if I had plot armor. And sass. Don't forget the sass.My adoptive parents adopted me and five other kids because of the money they\u2019d receive from the government. Mom had no job, dad was a school playground monitor. After I found out they stole $96k of inheritance money of mine and my biological sisters they kicked me to the curb, I haven\u2019t talked to them since.Where i live if a known drug addict had a baby they would take the baby away, doesn't stop them from trying though!People have been asking those questions thousands of years. There are a few things that have worked. But this is r/Showerthoughts, not really the forum for a deep and meaningful discussion of sex education, equality, and societal planning.Also I feel like this would *definitely* lead to a disproportionate amount of POC being deemed \"ineligiable\"It's not uncommon here in Denmark that kids are removed from parents who can't take care of them. In most cases, it's because the parents have some form of mental handicap.Proper sex Ed and free brith controlOi!  You got a loicense for that kid??And worse, how would you punish offenders? Throw them in jail? Then you have innocent children who have no parents.monkey fuckDumb voters can be manipulated.In the kitchen?Cause people are idiotsBecause it is also perceived as murder.Having a baby at 19 makes someone automatically inadequate as a parent, at least in contrast for someone who would choose not to have a baby at 19? Is that right?Reee harderClassistYou\u2019re fucking gross dude. You exude the strongest incel, women hater vibes ive seen in a long time (I guess like the last month \ud83d\ude44) Get help before you hurt someone or yourself.I think we have different definitions of soon, but we'll eventually all be olive/brown skinned if we don't blow each other up in the mean time.[deleted]The baby doesn\u2019t deserve that, it has done nothing wrong and deserves a chance at lifeYou really want me to believe that people who know enough about themselves and their situation, and the extreme demands of raising a child are egocentric?\n\nYou're so full of shit. Get condescended, worm.Not sure if you're agreeing with me or with the statement, but I've known teenagers who were great moms and adults who were terrible moms.  Age has nothing to do with it.Our laws make people think 18 is when they are biologically adults. But really it\u2019s more closer to 25. There\u2019s lots of brain development still going on.It does make you somewhat more responsible because the part of the brain that handles decision making is developed quite late. So a teenager will have a hard time acting on the knowledge they gain from self-reflectionIt's pretty much availability and cultural acceptability of contraceptives. Most humans probably don't want to have to raise and feed multiple children, and contraceptives finally gave them a fairly reliable choice. So when the pill was first introduced to Boomers, it wasn't yet widely acceptable so they had 4 kids. Generation X had fairly easy access so they had 2 kids. And Millennials are having 1 or 2 or skipping having kids altogether as it becomes more normal to do so. Countries and cultures where contraceptives are either taboo in their culture or religion, or are unaffordable are the countries that still have runaway population numbers increasing (eg countries in Africa). And generational attitudes towards sex and reproduction and gender roles take a LONG time to change.100%. My wife and I were 24 and basically studied everything we could for 9m and still had a day-by-day learning process. Having the responsibility to learn childcare is kinda like having a degree - doesn\u2019t prove you know everything about the job, only that you have the capability to learn.I kept telling myself...\n\n\u201cOut of entire history of humanity, I cannot be the worse at being a parent\u201d.  I told myself that enough that I eventually believed it and somehow with the assistance of my wife, grandparents, teachers and family and friends....raised a very good kid.First baby: bath in sink, water everywhere.\n\nSecond baby: bring the baby into the shower with meThat\u2019s both true, and with respect, useless. A nurse taught me how to change my son\u2019s diapers, clean him, feed him, etc.,. and fair enough, nothing but practice crosses that bridge.\n\nThat said, registering him in time for school, planning healthy meals, cooking, getting him therapy - these are all things that 18 year old me would\u2019ve totally failed. I\u2019m not about to get into a debate on 18 year olds as a class - I was definitely behind the curve, just saying, there\u2019s two things at issue here.\n\nNow, fair enough play if someone doesn\u2019t live in the 1950s \u201cnuclear\u201d family and has a wiser family member to shepherd that process, but as regards the conversation, that\u2019s exactly the same thing, just by proxy.Kudos to your mom really, i truly admire single parents who still manage to get through it and raise their children. I'm proud of her, and honestly I'm also proud of you for valuing her efforts!\n\nWe're in the same boat tho, but we'll manage it, one step at a time!I agree. It's intriguing to see how a lot of families lack what others already have and vice versa. Some families lack the financial stability option, but have the patience and the will to make the efforts to build a loving family, others lack the 2nd detail but do have financial stability if not more, others have none and just break down at some point one way or another.. Etc\n\nI honestly would love to read someone's experience about being in a fully stable family, financially, emotionally, mentally.. Etc it'd be great to know how it impacts them as persons, how they feel now after they grew up in it, and how it shaped them overall.I'm very aware of my irresponsibilityThis really made me smile tbh :) Thank you, really.Like 412 chicken nuggetsOhIt's hard, I raised my kid at 18, she wasn't planned but she was wanted it was hard for sure I like to think I was a great parent, my oldest is 19 lived trauma free,  always had a full belly Clean clothes and a roof over head and is going to university this year.  My cousin also had a kid and didn't want to have one and suffered and struggled and could've been better.\n\nThe crux of our arguement is choosing to have kids. We don't all get the luxury to choose. But what I'm saying that if you have a kid by accident and want that kid you're going to do an inherently better job than someone who was pressured into it.\n\nI acknowledge that mine is just an Anecdote but I feel it's appropriate.Yes, that is true. Careless and irresponsible people take the motto as \"do whatever you want regardless of the consequences since you're going to die one day.\"Having great parents that help you out a lot is a game changer. A 16 year old that has a baby but doesn't have a support system of people with money is much more likely to end up unemployed or stuck in poverty.\n\nHaving a good support system of people with money can help you not end up young and pregnant in the first place.\n\nWell off people can afford to save their children from things that could much more easily destroy a poor person's life.\n\nBesides teen pregnancy, a well off person can hire a better lawyer to get their kid off if they commit a crime, they can afford to keep a kid in university that is failing due to laziness or stupidity, they can absorb the cost of a DUI or at fault accident that would ruin a poor person.\n\nThat's not to mention the leg up they can give their kids in terms of tutoring, extra curriculars, and connections for internships and employment.\n\nThe poor literally can't afford to make the same mistakes as middle class and higher people can.Yeah, but it sounds like the kid turned out well and your sister made it through okay because she had hands on parents. So it\u2019s really not just credit to your sister, and it\u2019s a poor example of how her child changed her life for the better. It\u2019s not like she turned it around, having a kid and having parents to step in and support her is what turned her life around.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine what things would have been like if she hadn\u2019t had the absolute luck of parents helping.It's more than just money.\n\nThe average 16yo WITHOUT a kid struggles to staying on top of minor amounts of homework and textbooks.The only cases I know of where a teen parent ends up making a good life for themselves and their child are when they have family to step in and support them financially and practically. It\u2019s so dumb when that is used as an example of a successful outcome. It\u2019s literally just being lucky that you have parents willing to bail you out.If you chose to have a baby at 19, I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say you aren\u2019t planning on going to school at the same time. Those are usually the unplanned pregnancies.They don\u2019t deserve ridicule, but I refuse to think a child birthing and raising a child is anything less than sick. Either the teenager\u2019s parents take on the brunt of reading/cost of support or the mother struggles to work while so young, raising a baby in poverty. What a waste of a young woman\u2019s life, it\u2019s so tragic.\n\nFinishing your education and at the very least being independent first and NOT BEING A CHILD WITH AN UNDERDEVELOPED BRAIN makes a world of difference for both mother and child.\n\nSure there are of course teen mothers that turn out fine or are very loving and raise good kids but it\u2019s undeniably a fucked up situation to be in and anyone glamorizing it/romanticizing it/supporting it are delusional.[deleted]Is that why in movies and tv-shows with latinos they have so many uncles and aunts!?!?Oh I didn't even think to explain that lol forgot it was a thing for us LatinosThat's common where I'm from, and I'm white / MidwesternAlso in Italy. I didn't know that I should have called my mother's cousin 'cousin' until 20 years old. It still feels weird to me, for me she's just my aunt.I think what's confusing is the use of \"niece\" to mean the daughter of OP's cousin. I've always understood niece to mean only the daughters of my siblings.Ok but the child of your cousin is not your nieceI think you're right but most people would not consider their cousin's daughter to be their niece, which is confusing here.Ok but the parent of OPs niece is OPs sister/brotherThat reminds me of the whole corporal punishment debate. Everyone in the pro side is like, \"I was spanked as a child, and I turned out fine!\"  Well... you turned out to be the type of person who thinks it's okay to hit children, so...Fuck yeah buddy, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. \nA square\u2019s life is it\u2019s own punishment, so you don\u2019t have to worry about themI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re coworker is par for the norm standard for your small town, while anything you do to better yourself gets criticized for \u201cyou think you\u2019re so much better.\u201dDepressing prot tip of the day: That's not just a small town thing. Unsolicited advice is a total human thing and in big cities, \"knowing everyone's business\" caps out at the outer edge of one's social circle, instead of the whole city, but the principle is the same.I also live in the GTA so maybe there are less teen pregnancies in cities?What an awkward conversation to have with your parents \ud83d\ude05Hey I know that guy. He \"makes money\" by babysitting his other families' million kids. They've kinda just accepted that he will never have a job and he's more useful watching over all the kids while they do nothing. \n\nOh and they pay him in weed.Raise your kids, or raise your grandkids.He has four kids and no money, yet her *I* am with no kids and *four* money!I have a relative like that, but it's three baby mommas, not two, and he hasn't had a job in years. His mom pays for everything; his kids, his dogs and everything else in his life. She makes good money, but she hasn't has a vacation in years. \n\nI tell my kids (teens/young adults), that they don't get to be like him. I'll help them out as long as they are moving forward with their lives; going to school, getting vocational training, trying to get on their feet after a setback, etc., but they need to be working towards self sufficiency. I won't support them while they stay home all day playing video games and smoking weed.Making a choice to wait to have kids while my 2 oldest dropout siblings have a total of 14 kids.He sounds like a lot of fun!Eddie Murphy has 10 children by 5 women. Just burning money by the barrelful.Worked with a guy like that but he had 6 kids with 5 women. He worked 12 hours a day 6 days a week and took home about $150 dollars every two weeks because the child support was automatically removed from his check.\n\n I still have mixed feelings about it. He was a idiot but he also could barely pay for his food and gas to work and nothing else.I know a guy like this, except his \"job\" is lining up early at Targets and then driving to every Walmart, Walgreens, dollar store, and book store within 15 miles to scalp fresh restocks of trading cards to sell on Facebook marketplace....But are they really less intelligent or less educated?  That is a big difference. Same with addiction issues is it an education lifestyle issue or totally genetic?  \n\nSome kid living on the streets who can\u2019t read and has a drinking problem could have been an astrophysicist if given the right upbringing.\n\nOr maybe the brain and body are not great for today\u2019s world but the genes passed down could be perfect for future generations to survive in their environment.Yep, very taboo subject to talk about. \n\nWhile I wouldn't necessarily jump to eugenics, I will say that it's not fair or sustainable for the rest of society when the idiot who can't hold a minimum-wage job pumps out their 6th kid.I mean, my first thought wouldn\u2019t be eugenics, but early and consistent, quality public education. Yea it\u2019s slower than pointing out and force-sterilizing the \u2018undesirables\u2019, which a lot of countries used to do in the first half of the 20th century, and some still do! Looking at you, Canada. But you\u2019re not victimizing anyone and don\u2019t run a risk of, I don\u2019t know, committing a de facto genocide?That isn't correct. It's because the stupids outbreed the clevers to the point that the small number of clever offspring have a much harder time finding each other to begin their own slow cycle of not having any or enough kids to perpetuate the whole downward spiral. \n\nIt's not prohibiting the clever people in any way, other than by making the world so shit that they know it would be a bad idea to bring kids into it before they are stable enough to give their child the upbringing that they think it deserves. They don't *have* to, they choose to.Thanks to drones we don't even have those kinds of wars anymoreIt is clear that Idiocracy is a comedy and you shouldn't think too deep about it. \n\nEducation is infinitely more important then whatever genetics you have. Unless you suffered lead poisoning, or had a full lobotomy, there are no direct biological factors for intelligence. (The studies that do show biological factors often don't control for factors such as parental wealth).I know.  How many times have you met someone - then met the rest of their family and been confused?  I don't think that intelligence\\* is passed down the same way eye color is.\n\n\\*the problem being that we don't really have a good way to define or measure intelligence in the first place.  It's like 'taste.'   We know it when we see it but the only way to recognize it in others is to watch and see how they behave/think/choose.>people whose purported intellectual superiority is a fundamental aspect of their identity and self-worth \n\nI feel like thats not limited to reddit. Or even the internet for that matter'Batin!With a big side dish of \"you're so smart and special because you understand this movie\"Just going to a more recent example, a couple I know was freaking out about every little thing while pregnant. My wife and I tried to tell them they were stressing over the wrong things because you can't know what your child would be like. Of course, the baby comes and within days they tell us, \"none of the things we prepared for are a problem, it's the other things we never considered that we need to figure out.\"\n\nIt's also why I don't appreciate unsolicited advice from parents. If I ask, give me what you got. If I'm not asking, don't assume your solution works for my kid because it likely doesn't (and we likely already tried it).\n\nWe are all figuring it out. Kind of puts your own childhood in perspective too.Having kids at 19 is tough, do not recommend it. Not up for debate. But OPs shower thought is a logical fallacy: just because you didn't have kids young doesn't mean you're better equipped than someone that did have kids young to raise kids.More like a panicked \u201comg get it away from me\u201d throwUltimate Frisbee style\"Officer I drop kicked that baby in self defense\"This is the Day***hmmmmm***No, if i had a kid it would go to my parentsI think my mom would be kinda excited.\n\nShe always wanted more kids but could not survive another so i was end.I mean, when the townhouse down the street sold for $800 000, it is kinda hard to afford anything else other then your mortgage.Iunno, my dude\u2014 I think it\u2019s great that I\u2019m not being expected to have kids right now, nor is everybody else my age.> you're at the age where you'd have had children already if you lived at basically any point in human history before the last half-century.\n\nAnd buried a few too.You were also assumed to be dead by 60 and the biggest killer of women was childbirth.  It's not a single issue problem.Lol exactly. If you're missing pills occasionally and taking them at wildly different times everyday then the issue wasn't that it's \"not effective\", the issue is you didn't take it the way you were supposed to. That's made very clear by doctors, packaging, etc. People need to own up to their actions instead of blaming literally everything except themselves.There's some quote like, \"The only good leader is a reluctant one\".this is half the plot of Arc of a ScytheIceland tried this out for a while. Going off memory, I think the reviews were positive but the regular politicians killed it.Would I be getting paid the same or better salary than I get at my regular job? Otherwise I'd just get kicked off on the first day just like jury dutyI'm from Canada and this is not a political statement but our prime minister Trudeau is the son of former prime minister Trudeau. There is no fucking way he would've been elected if it weren't for his dad. Same for George Bush Jr. I guess.And friendship. Can\u2019t forget the friendshipI don't think they care. They got the money. Just sue them.I mean, it's Reddit. There's no sub out there that is an adequate forum for meaningful discussion.Anytime you try and regulate who can have children it usually leads to eugenics, mass infanticide, or both.Ya that's the issue with having a country with 328mil+ people. Our foster systems are broken as fuck and the adoption process is a joke. You'd just end up pulling kids out of a terrible home life and putting them in another shitty situation.[deleted]Bad guess, my dude.CloseI'm not a guy or an incel. Maybe in your country it's fine but when I was in school back in 2011 we had the ones who had future plans and the ones who had zero interest in doing anything with their lives and were heading the same way their parents and grandparents were. Just have a baby. Check on them today and see they're single with multiple kids (different dad's) asking where the \"real\" men are while posing semi nude. Ironically the ones of us with no kids are able to hold down a job and hold down our relationships. Not like these ones who rush for the \"family goals\".You just verified their great replacement conspiracy theory.Awww, is that what she told you? I mean, really, she was probably just trying to be a good parent and make you feel loved, even if you were an accident.Ur gayIf it isn\u2019t conscious yet it\u2019s perfectly ethicalEmbryos aren't babies.Yes because it\u2019s entirely predicated on the idea that people who have different life values and belief systems are less intelligent lmao. Or rather, \u201cthey just don\u2019t know\u201d.It's a scale, but honestly a very mature 20 year old is probably better equipped than a fairly immature 25 year old.\n\nAnd that's why arbitrary ages are a little arbitrary.That's essentially the reasoning behind raising the drinking age from 18 to 21.30 for me personally. I've spent 3-4 years of my 30s cleaning up the mess that I created during my 20s.I mostly agree! In fact thats what i was trying to convey with my \"your brain is less jacked up on hormones and is more developed\" part.\n\nHowever imo that doesnt actually make you more responsible it just makes it easier and more likely for you to be responsible. Plenty of people with fully developed brains elect to not use their capabilities fully and arent anymore responsible (or are in situations which make that choice drastically more difficult and potentially impossible)We were 24 when we had our first, now we're 30 with 3. Each kid has been so much more chill than the last. All the little things you panic about with the first don't bother you nearly as muchI kept reminding myself how hard it was to have a kid before the modern world. Childbirth was dangerous as hell. So was food scarcity, infection, and war. We don't have that in the US. More or less.SO THIS IS A THING PEOPLE DO! I have been trying to figure out the bathing the baby in the sink thing for ages.WeakOddly specific.That is like 5 times over my limit of chicken nuggets. I'd probably be a good father since I know my chicken nugget limits.Mine is 69 chicken nuggetsWhy not 420?Of course anyone who wants to have kids is likely to do better than those who don't. I just don't think it's true that a 19 year old who wants a kid will do better than a 30 year old, regardless. 19 is a tough time, and even if I wanted a kid at the time I know I would've fucked them up with a variety of emotional issues that I hadn't dealt with at that age. Now in my late 20s I would do much better because I've matured and understand emotional needs much better.I taught gifted high school students for ten years...and in all that time I had ONE student who came from a blue collar family...all of the other kids had professional parents.  This is not to say that giftedness of a child is directly correlated with parental income...but OPPORTUNITY is.  All of my students (except that one) had gone to enrichment summer camps since they could walk.  They could ALL play an instrument, and speak a second language.  Most of them were very athletic.  They had all (except the one) travelled the world extensively.  Money buys opportunity, and could develop the genetic potential that was there.I teach at a high school with a high teen pregnancy rate. There are distinct cultural patterns that play a role here. A lot of the Mexican girls get married as soon as they turn 18. I have taught many married students who are living with their husband (and usually his parents). This is common regardless of whether they had a kid before marriage or not. But many of the Mexican families have multiple generations of having kids young. A lot of the times, my students\u2019 parents had my students as teens, and now are grandparents in their thirties. The grandparents take care of the kid while the parents/my students get to be a young couple and finish school. A lot of the girls still go to college (some of the boys do too, but a lot of them prefer trades). \n\n\nCompare this to the south Asian girls I teach, primarily from Nepal and Myanmar. A lot of them will get \u201cmarried\u201d at 15 or 16 (not a legal ceremony but their families recognize it), most of the time to older guys who have already graduated and who have an income. The girl moves in with the guy. It is very rare for this group of girls to have a baby before marriage, but many of them are married in high school. These tend to be my most studious students and the majority go to college, boys and girls both. These girls have a high incidence of participation in school sports, notably more so that the Hispanic girls. \n\n\nCompare this still to the African American kids I teach. In my experience, African American kids (and I am specifying African American as opposed to Black because I also teach a number of students from Africa who tend to have family dynamics more similar to the South Asian families than to the African American ones) have the highest likelihood of being kicked out of their parents\u2019 house when they turn 18. They definitely have less direct support from mom and dad when it comes to having to deal with their responsibilities. African American girls have babies at my high school at about the same rate as other groups, but it always seemed to me that they had the most challenging situations to overcome. Some of them handle it amazingly! It just seems really hard. \n\n\nAnyway, these are just some of my observations of general trends I have observed over my eight year teaching career.I've always referred to my cousin's kids as my second cousins. I suppose I've also considered my parents cousins to be second cousins as well. \n\nNow I've confused myself.I think it\u2019s a respect thing. I have younger cousins that call my mom their aunt even though they\u2019re cousins too. Either that or they call her \u201ccousin X\u201d. Never just her name without a handleIn Texas, my parents raised me to call all adults who they were good friends with, or adult relatives who didn't already have another title like grandma, \"aunt\" or \"uncle\". My \"Uncle\" Rodney is like my third cousin. My \"Aunt\" Julie was a woman my mom used to get high with in the 70s.In some other countries/cultures, nephews/nieces and uncles/aunts can even be extra familiar. In brazil for example kids call every older person (closer to their parent's age then their own) aunt or uncle, even if their just family friends and in some situations unknown people. It's more affectionate than calling people mr/ms or by their nameI think also family size. My dad has 12 siblings so altogether I have 18 aunts and uncles.Yeah, technically it should be OP's cousin and OP's cousin once removedI completely understand OP\u2019s perspective my mom was an Orphan and all my \u201caunts\u201d and \u201cuncles\u201d are my second cousins and my \u201ccousins\u201d are actually second cousins twice removed \nTheir kids are my second cousins three times removed\nAll this is a mouth full so we just go with aunts and cousins and neblingsMaybe his brother married his cousin?That would be cousin once removed right?Some people refer to there cousins kids as nephews/nieces.  Similarly, I know folks who refer to there parents cousins as their aunts/uncles.\n\nIt\u2019s not correct, but doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nEdit:  Yeah, it does depend on ones culture and background.  Me saying it\u2019s not \u201ccorrect\u201d was with regard to my own anecdotal background.  It differs for others though.Technically you\u2019re right they would be their cousin once removed but they certainly feel like your niece sometimes and they\u2019d prob view you as an uncle/aunt growing upNiece is easier to say than \u201cfirst cousin once removed\u201dIf you are mexican they are your niece/nephewin many cultures we do consider cousins siblings and their children our nephews and niecesIn my culture (Asian) we call all our cousins\u2019 kids our nieces and nephews. Easier than the second cousin once removed shitI fucking laughing my ass off right nowOh.. okay.. you want \u201cmy first cousin twice removed probably thinks my first cousin is her mom and not her mom who is my first cousin once removed\u201dIn English speaking cultures this is the case. When you say most people, I know you probably mean most people in America but it's possible OP is not American and they are just translating from their language. \n\nIn any case, most people (in the World) would consider her the niece.In another part of her brain, my mom is fully aware of how abusive and neglectful her mother was and how all her anxiety and abandonment issues really stem from there... she just hasn\u2019t connected the dots, probably as a defense mechanism. So in this case \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d is more of a self-affirmation rather than actual belief. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to live in a state of denial, let alone my child. I\u2019m afraid if I had explicitly communicated my train of thought on this matter, my mom would\u2019ve had a mental breakdown. Smile and wave, smile and wave.She\u2019s still there. Has like 4 kids now. Is a cheer mom. Has had the same haircut since high school. Has numerous photos of her family in camouflage all over FB. Has separated and got back with her husband several times. Yea...... \u201cpar for course\u201d is accurate.I dunno man, I felt it was a lot worse when I was still on the small town. I\u2019m pretty much a fly on the wall on the city and I like that. That\u2019s just my experience tho.Your school probably had sex ed. Mine didn\u2019t and I think roughly 12 girls in my class of 200ish were pregnant/had kids by senior year.That just kept getting worse, wow. Guess it\u2019s good that at least someone is watching the kids? To the best of his ability which I suppose isn\u2019t strong. I mean, is he actually ok at it?Nothing wrong with a career in childcare.Welp, that's a great saying.Yeah he would complain about not having money, go to 7/11 everyday and buy $40 worth of overpriced snacks, and then quit shortly after my friend and I began working there because we were moving too fast for him.

Thanks for elaborating my point well, sorry for not being clear.[deleted]> lead poisoning\n\nA quick shout-out to the theory that the worrying rise--and fall--in violent crime in many countries [was due to burning of leaded gasoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis), spreading gradual brain damage. Lead poisoning can manifest as anger/impulse-control issues.> It is clear that Idiocracy is a comedy and you shouldn't think too deep about it.\n> \n> \n\nThis thread is literally full of people treating the premise of Idiocracy as a fact that is happening.> I don't think that intelligence* is passed down the same way eye color is.\n\nIt\u2019s not.

Basically just ways to make the system more transparent and level, but primarily to get rid of career politicians. The need to be reelected to continue getting paid causes big problems imo.I spent some time looking into legal remedies and found it wasn\u2019t worth it. My resolve is I don\u2019t have to support them or their retirement. They\u2019ll be working until they die. (Unless they adopt more kids).Agreed 100%As someone who as worked in the foster system, this is sadly correct. The amount of children who I\u2019ve seen pulled from their family for abuse or neglect only to be abused by their foster parents is truly heartbreaking.Only program America can adequately fund is our stupid fucking military. Even then, money is just being thrown away. Our government has ZERO idea how to spend money.I\u2019m in the UK and had the exact same experience. They\u2019re usually born into council estates and are taught by their own (once) teen mothers to have children ASAP to make the most of child benefits. And then it\u2019s just rinse and repeat. They are also oddly the only people active on my Facebook these days when I check it once every few months..... No? I'm talking about the phenomenon of our skin color slowly converging due to different races intermarrying.[deleted]I sided with you until now OP...Nice pic bro did you get that from the sex offenders list?I have no memories from before I was 3. My consciousness didn\u2019t develop yet. \n\nYou are for murdering 3 year olds if you believe that it is ethical on those grounds. \n\nAlso aborted babies have brain activity, dream, feel pain, move, sleep, swim, have heartbeats and many more things at extremely young ages. Little babies in the womb try to get away from the needles and brain scrambler. It\u2019s barbaric what happens to them\n\nI challenge you to consider when a human life truly becomes a human life. The only scientific explanation is conception.They *are* less intelligent, you dumb fuck. Obviously they don't know.US Military disagreesno the reason was MAAD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) putting forward a bill that cut off federal funding for roads for any state that didn\u2019t up the drinking age.Id say it's case by case. Working in the banking industry, I've seen 40 or 50 year olds with the financial and common sense of a cucumber. Like, I've had 18 year olds that were  better adjusted then those \"adults\" I'm talking about. (All these examples are different individuals, not related at all, fyi)Yeah same here. 28-30 I think.Seriously. Not even in the quadruple digits.https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/cprkux/can_someone_get_to_420/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf[This dude ordering one thousand nuggets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzivTm-4QAk)Until you realize you don't know the chicken nugget limit of the kids...NiceNiceMy kids were in gifted programs and I got so frustrated that more black and Hispanic children weren\u2019t selected to join. Many obviously qualified. A teacher finally pointed out to me, \u201cWe DO encourage them to join the gifted programs. Everyone who scores on the IQ test is encouraged to join. They refuse.\u201d Culturally, being in a gifted program is seen as a negative. The kid would get bullied.Those would both technically be first cousins once removed.Your first cousins kids are your 1st cousins once removed. If you had kids, they would be second cousins with of your cousin's kids.i think it all depends how close you are to your cousins. my cousins are around my age, we grew up together. my cousin has a daughter, i refer to as my niece (US).It\u2019s kinda like the term \u201chalf-brother\u201d, that\u2019d be a weird thing to call someone. It\u2019s more important if you\u2019re doing genealogy or some shit but otherwise you should call people whatever you\u2019ve mutually agreed to.So the cousins' kids are also your cousins? Mind bogglingMaybe we should ask OP which state they live in.Brousin*dueling banjos riff*Indeed. \"Once removed\" means *down or up a generation*.People could be from different cultures and country....i know in india, first cousins are considered siblings...someone mentioned in mexico as well.Yeah I do both and it makes enough senseAll my cousin's kids call me Aunt. I call them my nephews and neices.This is why being aware of other cultures and traditions are important. You have people flat out telling other cultures and they're \"wrong\".plus even in the US if you\u2019re close to your cousins you very well may just refer to their children as your nieces/nephews.Definitely a more concentrated thing in small towns, but a thing in cities too. It's more a luck of the draw on where you work, so far as the gossip/business thing goes, but unsolicited advice is rampant everywhere I've ever been.That is... Concerning...\n\nMine did have sex-ed. From Grade 6 to Grade 9.Oh yeah. Great guy. Just no viable skills besides child care and his family basically inhibits him from making any actual money because they always \"need\" him to watch their kids. How he pays for child support I have no clue.True, but when you have child support to pay, you need to make some actual money. Debtor's prison will catch up eventually. :/Personally just don't see a choice. kids are expensive. 7 kids are insane and they both been drove into poverty and welfare programs to just get by.Yeah, didn't think about how reddit takes words so literally when I was framing that comment.\n\nBut yes, thanks for clarifying.Already done that... Didn't work though.Yeah... I've thought for a while now that between lead poisoning and cold war propaganda there sits a large number of the Q listening population.So spray it with raid afterwards?Also when a conversation tips dangerously into eugenics it's probably a good idea to back out before you start looking like a fan of Ayn Rand...My partner's mom has fostered kids for years. I've heard too many stories about kids whose mom was a drug user during pregnancy, and somehow constantly gets custody back even when they can't stay sober! It's incredible to me.You are a wise person, my_balls_your_mouth1We sacrifice the Almighty Dollar to the Military Industrial Complex because Bang Bang Jesus Loves the USA... or something.I'm UK too and yeah they have their own generational handbook or so you'd think. Oh yes! Facebook is their favourite lol and don't forget how they're all \"disabled\". Countless times I've met people who are proud to confess the state pays for them to live in their property and how they fake their illness. Literally had a guy try to teach me how to fake anxiety. He told me before he goes for his progress appointments he splashes his hair with water (that's the sweat) then he said I need to be all shaky and have trouble saying what I want and boom, results. \n\nI learned this shit from simply complaining I was tired from work. Amazing! XDAw man, yeah, you really got me. Go dig up my mom and scrape her teeth. I don\u2019t see your point except that you\u2019re trying to tell everyone you\u2019re a little baby who can\u2019t take a meany comment.Mother and gay comebacks, is this middle school?You never were with op if that made you switch sides so easily.Ur still gayIf you do it young enough in the womb It doesn\u2019t matter. Also I do NOT want to murder 3 year olds what kind of logic is that>My consciousness didn\u2019t develop yet\n\nWrong. 3 year olds do have consciousness. \n\n>Also aborted babies have brain activity, dream, feel pain\n\nIts literally impossible to have memories, dream, feel pain, etc when you don't have a brain or nervous system, as embryos don't. The ability to feel pain only develops in very late trimesters.\n\nHeartbeats =/= viability, I have no idea why people like you fetishize heartbeats. Also what you try and call a \"heartbeat\" at four weeks or whatever is a 4 mm wide tube known as a \"fetal pole.\" \n\nAlso embryos don't \"swim\" they float in amniotic fluid. \n\n>Little babies in the womb try to get away from the needles\n\nNo they don't, and what needles? I don't think you have the slightest ideas how abortions are performed.\n\n>and brain scrambler. \n\nlol wat XD \n\nIf you're just going to invent words for medical equipment quit pretending you have interest in anything scientific here.\n\n>The only scientific explanation is conception.\n\nYou're funny. In reality, science cannot define when life begins, because that is not a scientific question. Its a philosophical one based on subjective morality.By 25 minds are more likely to be filled with predisposition, morality, and individuality.\n\nAll things that make bad soldiers. It needs to be kids signing up or nobody would and they need some perks for even that to work.I hope he broke the world record. Omg..This makes my record of 70 look like a joke. I need to start trainingThat clerk was on point,  troll stopped dead in his tracksNiceThat is a very English way to look at it. German also has first/second/third (degree) aunts, uncles and nephews. Generational distance is added with \"great\" and \"grand\". So my cousin's grandsons are my second degree grandnephews.What are my parent's cousins?Yup! Here's a good rundown that explains it well: https://youtu.be/PM79Epw_cp8what else could they be?Probably the state of confusion and despairDieceTIL! As a kid with no real cousins x removed I just thought it meant they were estranged.Yep I'm Mexican and all my Tias and Tios are actually my mom's cousins. Only one of them is my actual uncleright that person is being pedantic lolThe US's teen birth rate is like 2.5x higher than ours is up here in Canada.I mean, child care should be broadly considered as a viable skill. My baby\u2019s nanny charges $25/hr. Looks like they\u2019re exploiting him to the max.Maybe he pays child support in weed?maybe he can start a daycareChild support is a portion of your income, is it not? If he doesn\u2019t make anything, by law it seems like there\u2019s not much to be done about it.It\u2019s basically a no win situation for foster kids. If they stay with their parents, they could continue to be abused or neglected. If they are taken from their parents with the intention of one day being reunited, they have absolutely no stability in their lives, could be abused by their foster families, and could continue to be abused upon reunion with their parents. If they are put into the foster system permanently, they could face even worse abuse than they did from their parents. \n\nI worked in mental health in a group home for foster kids who had too many failed placements to successfully find a new foster family, and the mental health challenges these kids faced were so, so brutal. I lasted less than 6 months in the field before it became too much for me.It may as well be.  Look who threw the first flame.First cousins once removedI live thereNuh uh! No way! Its the state of denial!I have an *estranged* auntie. It just means we don't talk to her. Also she might have died **Shrug*\\*I\u2019m half-Cuban and half-Colombian.

    "Comments": "Only applies if you're talking about caffeine and not meth.unless you're in a place where siestas are popular, which is, according to wikipedia, \"a number of Mediterranean, tropical, and subtropical countries\"I love my daily lunch-break nap! I make and eat a sandwich (which only takes 10 minutes of my hour) and then I lay down on my creeper beside my toolbox and pull out the drawer above me to block the overhead lights. Nap time in the shop is my favorite part of the day!This why I'm so glad to work for myself.  My boss pretty much orders me to take a nap when I need it...People would be doing their morning cocaine if it was legal.\" Dont even talk to me until ive had my morning rails\" would be a thing.One of my local truck drivers approached me today and said: \"boss, the coffee isn't doing it for me. Can I take off and get an espresso real quick? I'll be back in like 10 minutes.\"\n\nI said \"Sure, no problem - or you could just hit the couch for a half hour or so and get a nap. I bet that'd be better.\"\n\nHe was a little surprised, and protested that he had a delivery to complete, but I pointed out that it wasn't late until 90 minutes from now, so there was time - but again, his choice. I opined that I felt he'd be more rested after a quick nap and some hydration.\n\nHe sacked out for a little over 30 minutes, then had some water and was very happy with his energy level. I think it was saner, safer, and just better all around.\n\nCatnaps are very restorative. I highly recommend them.Btw I just wanted to add, it\u2019s weird how coffee makes people not tired. Instead of making us more awake, it blocks the receptors from accepting the chemical which makes us tired. \n\nIt is not a replacement for sleep. It\u2019s only making it worse.Naps mess me up. Once I go down I don\u2019t wanna get back up and I\u2019m groggy the rest of the day \ud83d\ude1eFunny how our entire society is revolved around making sure you can work as much as possible before you die.I always thought it would be a great model if you went to the office in the morning, went back home to have lunch and a nap, and then continued working from home (or Vice versa).Liquid stimulant be tasty tho, gotta give it thatI do both.My doc told me no more naps because it's probably fucking with my sleep habitsI used to make fun of my dad for napping every day. Now that I\u2019m near 30\u2026 I get it.in fact many employers will provide that drug, and a break in which to take it, for free.Why do I hate myself. I do this. And I'm thinking about quitting coffeeMy guy there are some people like me who when they take a afternoon nap wake up in the midnight and its worse than the worst hangover.Or a tiny mid day bump..\"The Spanish Economy\" would like to have a wordThey can\u2019t stop me from sleeping during my lunch break, siesta bitchesdude my parents would constantly get mad at me for taking naps (I do that maybe twice a year)... like why are you mad I'm getting some sleepWell, I think Latin countries have it right. The siesta.I love naps, I get home from school everyday at 2:50 and i just sleep till like 5-6 every single day. \n\nIts amazing cause then I go back to sleep around midnight lolcoffee is so tasty though \ud83d\ude2dI look forward to mine every morningI took a nap today. Plan on it tomorrow as wellI hate naps, they\u2019re way too much work.Naps are a tease.My previous job had a couch in the corner of the lunchroom behind a pillar. I'd take my lunch when it was empty and then shut the lights for a quick ten minute nap, that was quite refreshing.Can't make money off you when you nappin.The real trick is to pump yourself full of caffeine and then take the nap. You wake up feeling like you're in the marvel comic universe.I've got a two year old and when she naps. I take a damn napI love bothGotta make sure those poor capitalists don\u2019t go hungry now don\u2019t we?! Gotta keep the machine goin\u2019 to keep that dough rollin\u2019!Work work work, SkymoonNapping fcks up my sleep schedule and coffee does nothing for me, I just like the way it tastes.And that's just Fucked with a capitalistic F.Since when are naps taboo? Lol whatUnless you are in JapanI hate that when I take naps I feel groggy for so long afterwards and I\u2019m also more likely to experience sleep paralysisOh fuck nobody told me mid-day naps are taboo did I miss the memo oh shit oh fuck I'm so fuckedCovfefeWhere are naps taboo?Nobody cares if you take a napSo stop giving a damn what idiots think and do whats best your you.  Naps are better than caffeine.  If you can take a nap, do it and don't care what caffeine-addicts think.And don't forgot to keep your salary to yourself, ~~so nobody realizes they're being screwed~~ because it's impolite.My work place would rather i take 5-6 5-10 minute breaks rather than a 10 minute nap. We should have nap rooms in officesI blatantly tell people I'm on Modafinil, most people want to try it until I mention it's prescription loldunno bout that tbh, everyone that I talk to love naps.People from western countries, even lunch break naps are taboo there?oh I live in the US and I take naps in my car all the time, 15 minutes here, an hour there. ill eat during work and take naps during official breaks and lunches, I don't mess around with proper rest.My new boss (at the time) used to call me about 1:20 in the afternoon to \u201cgive me time to eat lunch\u201d before going over whatever she had thought of that morning.  That, of course, was nappytime.  When I became more miss than hit at taking those calls, I finally told her that was my quality \u201cme time\u201d to take a nap.  At first she was mad I was sleeping on the clock (to which I reminded her I was salaried and worked at my leisure).  And then one day she took a little siesta after lunch.  \u201choly shit! I\u2019m productive all day now!\u201d Funny how that afternoon grind isn\u2019t so bad when you aren\u2019t tired and feeling done for the day.Because you can work tired and heavily caffeinated, you can't work when you're having a nap. Get back to work peasant! /S but probably the actual reason.#And the latter is more effective!Last time I checked it doesn't take 2 hours to have an espresso, siesta on the other hand yep.??? Nobody where I work would judge you for that. We even have a room with a massage chair with a lock on the doorMid day naps during lunch at the office have saved my sanity. 30-40 minutes in the phone booth (which should be converted to a nap booth) and I'm much more alert the rest of the dayI work from home now and take a nap when I need one. Way more productive than working at a terrible efficiency because you're burnt out.It does nothing for me, i just really like the tasteIf I lay down for a \u201cnap\u201d, I\u2019m waking up 5 hours later confused and groggy.if I tried to have a mid day nap it would tuen into a 5 hour crash flowed by panic and feeling worse than I did before lying downThat\u2019s capitalism for you.I am a teacher working in China.  I have a 2 hour lunch break and most of the staff have a soft roll mat, pillows, and a duvet and have a proper nap every day.  I didn't grow up here and so it's still quite novel to me, but it's pretty normal behaviour here.  I would say it really, really breaks your day up.  You're literally 4 hours away from having a sleep when you arive, and you're 2 hours away from going home after you wake up.i take naps all the time and i give no fucks. its my favorite.I work from home. I nap on my lunch break.Laughs in siestaI see this as true for some western contexts like the US, but there are a great profusion of others where having a midday nap is not only acceptable but an integral part of the culture.Depends on the culture. Midday naps are common in many parts of the world... Spain, Latin America, Greece, ChinaOr just get more sleep in general. Sleep is underrated.I felt this in my soul. People always shit on me for a 30 minute lunch nap. I feel amazing after.Nobody makes money off you taking a nap.\"Laughs in Spanish\"Naps are free.I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at all. I don\u2019t think either are considered taboo at all.because people see sleeping as weak-sauce![deleted]It's even less taboo to get a decent night's sleep so you don't have to drink a ton of coffee.Midday naps are amazingly effective and efficient, in my experience.\n\nIf I can put my head down for half an hour, I wake up reenergized and able to think far more clearly. It\u2019s like getting 2 days work out of one day.Don\u2019t they take naps in Japan as part of their work day?Mid day naps ruin full night's restsi can't take naps.. like literally physically can't fall asleep in the middle of a day.\n\nSo should i be misserable and sleepy all day? you know its not just drug=drug right ? :P cause i wouldnt consider coffee as bad as cocaine.\n\nCoffee is actually healthy, look up the proven health benefits from the antioxidant propreties in coffee..Na fam I'm spanish I'm allowed to do thatYou can't make other people money napping.In America, yes. \n\nIf you haven't realized already, the vibe here in this country is straight up ADHD. \n\nThis country got y'all thinking sugar isn't a highly addictive substance. Meanwhile the rest of the world calling America fat and America wondering wtf they talking about.Naps don't make your boss or the coffee shop more money. They're not in the business of your well being. They're only interested in profitsWhy not both?Me sitting over here like why not both?yeaaah sure, as my boss would love the idea of \u200b\u200bme taking a nap at workYou're assuming both have equivalent effects in every person.*angry caffeine addict noises**laughs in spanish*You can thank capitalismLiterally nobody thinks naps are tabooThis is largely an American dysfunction.  Most of South America, Asia, and Europe drink coffee and tea and take naps in the middle of the day.If you eat right you dont need caffiene or a nap. Thats the secret noone tells you.A lot of why it sounds so crazy is the way you\u2019ve worded it. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s considered less taboo to drink a cup of coffee than it is to deliberately make yourself unconscious in the middle of a work day\u201d\n\nWhen you make one side sound blas\u00e9, and the other sound extreme, you can make anything sound better/worse.\n\nI don\u2019t think either are taboo in reality tbhCapitalism. Selling you solutions to the problems it makes for you.It seems to be a quintessentially American invention.   \n\n\nSeveral Spanish speaking countries have \"siestas\" where the town shuts down in the middle of the day for instance.Because one allows you to work more and the other is you physically stopping working to be unproductive. I wonder why one is a taboo and the other is encouraged in the American Hustle based capitalist culture...Nah fuck that nap all the way coffee can go to hellThere new study that show lots of day time napping = more chance of Alzheimer\u2019s for youThe problem is not the coffee itself. The problem is the loads of sugar, caramel this or that, creams and whip cream, all sorts of artificial flavors that some people add to it. Let\u2019s start our day with a nice big cup of caffeine, sugar and inflammation! We Americans are a weird bunch.Sloth is a great sinA *harmful* liquid stimulant drug - coffee gives you a ton of bad health outcomesNot if you live in SpainIs this a US thing? I used to work in Vietnam and during our lunch break, we almost always take a 30-60 min nap after lunch before working the afternoon hoursUnless you're in Japan, then it's accepted to be able to doze off at work (because it supposedly shows that you're so hard working that you're missing regular sleep)Coffee takes a few hours to give you the stimulus anyway. It's likely any sugar in the drink that's giving you the immediate buzz.I consider this a misunderstanding of the word tabooFYI - Coffee/caffeine isn\u2019t a stimulant, it blocks the adenosine receptors that make you sleepy.My doc told me no more naps because it's probably fucking with my sleep habits Your body sleeps following 90 minute cycles. This means napping for the right amount of time is crucial. Napping also creates a strong placebo affect on your perceived energy levelMaybe because coffee is consistently associated with mild but measurable health benefits while naps aren't?Ah, who doesn't love a hot cup of capitalism.Yep...caffeine needs to become a controlled substance if not banned. We are living on a planet full of people addicted to it, and it's been shown to cause serious damage over time, both to the brain and the heart. No dear readers, I'm not going to find the papers for you, you can do this yourself.\n\nIf you need coffee when you get up every day, you are an addict.\n\nIf you need coffee during the day to keep going, you are an addict.\n\nIf you think you just enjoy it, switch to decaf. You'll probably find that you're an addict.Thanks to capitalism it is, gotta get off your bum and make the moneyThe people that agree with this, it really shows how little you travel.\n\nIn several cultures around the world, you are given 3-4 hour lunch breaks. In which they also encourage you to nap.I still don\u2019t understand why it isn\u2019t normal to just put your head down for a little breakIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s less taboo it\u2019s that society says napping is badBecause after midday nap you wake up in parallel reality feeling like shit... At least that's my experience...Why not both lolRead this also for a bit more insight. I guess naps cause all major diseases/conditionsIf you say it like that it does. But this is an un-equated statement. To be equal you have to explain a nap as \"a brief period in which you lay down, slow your breathing, brain activity, and heart rate. Until you fall unconscious untill you gain consciousness after a predetermined time\"Rapacious capitalism don\u2019t work when you\u2019re sleeping.I hated taking naps in daycare. When I finally got to sleep, I wouldn't want to get up.\\*in Western countries where capitalism has created a civilisation of labour slaves designed purely to create profits for their business overlords.... it's considered less taboo to constantly pump yourself full of a liquid stimulant drug to keep yourself awake during the day than laying down for a quick mid-day nap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfixed it.Considered taboo by whom? I think the only people who would actually rather you damage your body than lose 20 minutes of productivity are the human paperclip maximizers who burrow their way into middle management.Can\u2019t be a \u201cproductive\u201d worker when you\u2019re asleepIn the Marine Corps, taking naps over eating lunch is keyYep. Why is that?They can\u2019t charge you too nap, and you don\u2019t make them money while nappingHuh? I take naps on my lunch breaks all the time. Nobody's ever seemed to have a problem with me closing my eyes for 20-30 minutes in my car.I can do bothYou should see airline mechanics, we get all jacked up on energy drinks for our naps while the airplanes flyThat and the time I have alloted to me to eat and take a nap would not be fulfilling to either.Liquid stimulant? Where y'all getting liquid cocaine?For me, there is no such thing as a 'quick mid-day nap.' It is either a solid 2 - 3 hour sleep or it is another cup of coffee.Tell me you're under 30 without telling me you're under 30.Ironically, most (successful enough to read about)CEOs take naps.\n\nRead most any successful CEOs routines or rituals, naps.If I lay down for that nap I'm literally never getting up againMan, I wish my body would actually let me just quickly nap. Sleep and I don\u2019t get along very wellA quick mid day nap for me always ends up with me waking up at 10 pmI'm going to say it, I don't like naps, there, I don't care if it's an unpopular opinion.Man trying to explain this to people is exhausting...time for a nap.But liquid stimulant taste good.Welcome to capitalism.During late 2020 and early 2021 I got a new job where I had to be in the office. I would get take out for lunch and eat in my car because dine in was still shut down. I got in the habit of taking a 15 or 20 minute nap in my car after eating and I think that's one of the best things you can do for your afternoon.Often just doing low energy work makes a person sleepy. In this case a nap probably won't help. Caffeine is good for these situations.\n\nBut so is physical exercise. People who gym in the morning (or before work) will know how this boosts you for the day. Physical exertion also helps you sleep better, so all round you are more alert when awake.\n\nAlso, people often don't get enough sleep in general.Then there's me telling my mates \"I'll be back in a bit\", lying down in the floor in the study, and closing my eyes for an hour with the headset on so I can still hear them and my music.You guys don't take mid-day naps?Because the nap makes me feel like shit and coffee/soda/your mother's pussy taste goodHave you ever taken a mid day nap? Unrecoverable. The rest of your day is fkd.***VERY MUCH*** depends on the culture you are in. There are many \"go go go, work work work, earn earn earn!\" cultures. But there are also many that enjoy life and appreciate their time.Yeah because more unconsciousness is pointless.People.  \n\nCan't.  \n\nJustdothat.Dry scooping pre-workout and chasing it with a large blue Red Bull is how I wake myself up for work.WFH taught me to nap mid day. Now I\u2019m back at my office. Bought a couch.Pro tip : don't do either one of these things.  Stop drinking caffeine all day and get a good night's rest.When I used to take public transit I'd nap in the bus/metro/train all the time in a weird state of conscious napping. I knew exactly where I was (so I didn't miss my stops) but the shut-eye was obviously what I needed to reinvigorate me before or after class/work.Its better viewed to get a quick drink than slack of in the middle of the day and lose all of your dynamismAnyone who judges naps as less than good is a damned fool.If i take a mid day nap, i won\u2019t be sleeping at all at night \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u00bfPor que no los dos?My quick nap turns to 3 hours, really quick lol.Some of us can't \"nap\" and will sleep for four hoursYou can't make corporate any money if you're asleep!Well, for some people naps actually make it worse so who the fuck cares lolIt\u2019s because of marketing. The dollar always trumps the mind.Welcome to AmericaI get migraines after small naps, I don't do caffeine either for a similar reason, I'm jealous of you all.Wait...coffee stops you all from sleeping? At best it keeps me alert. The instant I decompress even a little bit \"TIME TO NAP, BOYS!\".por qu\u00e9 no los dosNOt everyone can just lay down for a quick nap. Count yourself luck friend. Lots of people need medication, like myself, to just sleep at night.Lots of us can't lie down for a mid-day nap because they can't nap :(\n\nCoffee is all there is.\n\nIt is our life-fluid.\n\nAnd we suffer when its level is allowed to drop and we get too much blood in our veins.Depends if you have narcolepsy or not \ud83d\ude02I am a proudly defender of naps, I got no shame to take one in my desk office when my body calls for it, after lunch or if my mind is fuzzy\u2026 proud to rise my red marked face with blurred eyes when somebody interrupts me during the impasseOne of the things I love about my work is that we've got a break area with rooms specifically setup for people to have a nap.\n\nGenerally I only ever use it during my lunch break, since that way nobody can really question my usage, but it's there anytime anyone wants to use it.In my workplace there is little to no stigma in naps. Whenever I say in a meeting that I\u2019m going to take a nap or that I had a nap previously, people will react with \u201dgood for you\u201d, \u201dthat\u2019s nice\u201d or \u201dgreat idea, I think I will do the same\u201d. This is amazing progress from just a few years ago when I would never have even considered having a nap during the work day.\nI do understand this is not the norm in most places and that I am very lucky.Western work culture is not designed for your wellbeing, but rather for your efficient exploitation. Be a rebel, take a napA nap keeps you above the minimum to function. Coffee pushes you into full capacity temporary to work better, sleep is not as good at doing thisCapitalism.I take naps all the time I dunno what you're talking aboutNot in spain\u2026I miss the midday naps I took in my car on hot days when I worked in retail. I don't miss retail though!Lol I\u2019ve worked at companies where if you said you were super tired and needed a line, there\u2019d be a fat line of coke on your desk within minutes. There\u2019s no time to not be working as far as they are concerned. The nice part though is at 5pm they walked out the door. Could be mid sentence 5 hits and they are like were out of here.Really, I don't think that's the case and you shouldn't feel pressured not to take a napPatients don\u2019t stop needing their meds or not needing help just because you need a nap. \nLiquid stimulants it is.Can't make the owners any money while you're napping. Now, drink up and get back to work!!you're young... thats deadass what old people do.I lack the ability to simply sleep wherever I am.I have severe insomnia.

I take naps whenever I feel like it. Didn't realise there was a taboo around it.In what world is taking a nap taboo?One of the benefits of working from home. If you\u2019re tied and can\u2019t get anything done even though it\u2019s only 13:30, take a quick nap and you can have a productive afternoon.I can't take quick naps I just sleep.Reading this as I'm drinking my early morning coffee. I feel seen...Which is why my platform for 2024 is a mandatory nap in the middle of your day! Vote for me!I do bothNot everywhere, we do both in Mexico \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0fSince working from home I regularly have a 10 - 15 min nap on my lunch break. \n\nMakes a huge difference to my afternoon productivity levelsMust. Keep. Working.jokes on your when I do both!Coffee breath yuk!How have societies managed to make naps taboo... They're good for you, they fucking increase productivity too!

Never sleep siesta. Always go the coffee waythe spice must flow\nspecifically your money flowing to businesses for things you didnt need because of problems we createdI do both each day, I'm retired!fucking preech it bro. adult  day naps need to be a fucking thing at all workplaces and normalized in general.    I am a contractor and I regularly find some shade and doze off for an hour on lunch breaks to get a recharge.   No amount of coffee can replicate the fresh mind and legs that comes from a power nap.Just got to drink enough drugs that you evolve beyond sleep, where you can see sound and taste coloursProbably because society has conditioned us to believe that you need to be active and productive throughout the day, and napping is lazy. Energy drinks and coffee are fine, so long as you're making the country/company money. It's all horse shit, but we're all too far gone to truly understand that, and lunch breaks aren't nearly long enough to spend pondering the finer details of this existence.If it's meth you gotta lay low.I was on my way to get my meth injection kit but thankfully I saw your comment.Nah, some of my bosses would rather give me meth than restBut if its a slightly weaker version of meth then you're fineUsed to apply to cocaine.I have ADHD the medication for it is basically meth , it slows us down instead of speeding us up but caffeine has no effectYes, here in Vietnam it\u2019s perfectly ok to have a proper nap in a bed under your desk in a corporate environment . As a non-Vietnamese can confirm it\u2019s highly effective at reenergising youLiving the life!In Seville, Spain there\u2019s even an hour period designated for daily naps. In most of the city it\u2019s considered highly important and people have created unofficial rules to respect this hour including reducing honks, music, etc. I like this idea a lot I think it makes organization socially much easier and functional.And yet Americans tend to view those places as inferior. Sounds to me like they've got work-life balance figured out a hell of a lot better than we do.Basically the places where it's too fucking hot at midday to do anything useful anyway.Chinese society also allows napping at noon. Some company will even turn off the light.They however begin their working day earlier and finish later to compensate. Some of these countries will also have more hours worked in the day as well.I live in a Mediterranean country and the culture here is that if you don't stay at work everyday for 3 unpaid hours longer than you should, then you're a lazy bum, so I'm not sure which countries they're talking about, but it definitely isn't PortugalPaid hour lunch break needs to become a thing. I usually just shovel down my lunch as fast as possible so I can leave work as soon as possible. But man a midday nap would be nice as the first four hours fly by then last half of the work day is like walking up hill in mud.An entire hour, wow, we only get 20 minutesI just got a creeper and it's so comfortable to lay down on. I might just get rid of my mattress.Don\u2019t get a ticking alarm clock, George.I work 12 hour overnight shifts, if we aint doing much I'll set a 40 minute timer and pass the fuck out in my chairHave you ever hit your head on the drawer when waking up? That would definitely happen to me more than once \ud83d\ude05I read this and saw a comedy bit unfold: you fall asleep and your creeper starts rolling, down the street, onto a highway \u2026 comes to rest in a different garage. You wake up like \u201cwait wut?\u201dGlad to hear your boss is always looking out for you. The perks of being your own boss.Team meetings would be full of nonsensical rants.I\u2019m pretty sure I read somewhere that people used to put cocaine in coffee and soda for an extra pick me up effect.If you had ever seen someone who did coke on a daily basis for a while you would know that that's not true.\nCoke isn't exactly healthy.I be doing my morning adderall for sure, lol.Also, heroin as a sleep aid.  \"Having trouble falling asleep?  Just shoot up with some horse!  Our intro pack includes a **free** spoon and lighter...\"I know people say that taking power naps energize better than drinking caffeine but if I personally lay down for less than an hour nap I feel really groggy. Normally when I nap I take 2-3 hours so a full sleep cycle lmao. But I can\u2019t do that during the day so I drink coffee instead.It takes me half hour to fall asleep \ud83d\ude2dgood boss.Too bad I can't take naps, they always end up turning into regular sleeping and I miss things :(I wish I was capable of napping. Just not in the cards for me.Good bossDefinitely safer. Aren't truckers the main \"culprits\" in drowsy driving?\n\n(I say culprits but obviously it's the companies' fault for demanding crazy delivery times)As a former speedster i gotta say coffee is a shit tier stimulant.\nThe \"energy\" it gives you is just an illusion that you have less time to make a deadline than you actually do.\n\nAnd while the first cup of the day wakes you up, if you were a non user you would be  at that level when you awake and through the rest of the day.[deleted]So it's just numb the sleepy part of the brain. That explains why I still felt like shit after drinking my fourth cup of joe at 3 AMIt doesn't give energy either. It's all fake. It's overdrive mode. Thank you for pointing it out. It's the biggest fake out, lie about caffeine.Sort of, its primary method of action is by blocking adenosine receptors, however caffeine does also promote the release of dopamine to a small degree.I adore coffee but can only drink one cup a day because it gives me terrible anxiety and heartburn. But then I get really tired and I wish I had a good pick me up without the anxiety. I'm trying out black tea and caffeine pills because oddly caffeine in it's pure form gives me less anxiety than when it's in coffee. I have l-theanine too but I don't know if it is actually making a difference or just making me more tired.Coffee never made me sleepy. Gives me the same effect as hot chocolate, which is \u201coooh tasty\u201dYup this is spot on. Long term coffee drinkers also develop more of the receptors that make you tired since the brain is adapting to them being activated less. This increased receptor density is why they need that cup of coffee to get them going.Apparently not everyone can nap. It simply doesn't work for some people. I'm the same.Or take a mid day nap and can\u2019t sleep at nightI haven\u2019t tried the coffee nap, but I\u2019ve tried everything else. My problem is I enjoy sleeping too much haha. Whether its 10 mins, 20 mins or 90, once my body goes into any kind of rest mode I\u2019m just like\u2026yep done for the day! \n\nIt\u2019s why working from home works so well for me. I\u2019m at my desk 10 mins from waking up and ready to go. A long commute and I reach work all like ehhhhhhh how do I turn my brain on, because it went too long without stimulation. Add problems \ud83d\ude41And then can\u2019t go to sleep at my normal bed timeKeep them only 10-20 minutes or a full 90\nMinutes. Anything in between you\u2019ll wake up mid sleep cycle and feel like shit.\n\nYou can also try caffeine naps. Drink a strong tea or weak coffee, immediately lay down to rest for 15-20 minutes, when you wake up your buzz will have just kicked inFor me it's not even necessarily the grogginess, but it's the time skip. I get so disoriented when I skip through 1, 2, 3 hours of my day.This could be a song!Yeah, we are a bunch of friggin lemmings.  I'm going down for a nap because I'm giving the finger to the man!  Rebellious napping.As someone who doesn't drink coffee or energy drinks I sometimes just feel straight up fucked by society. Like my body and mind are just not built for 8,5 hours of work every day, but here I am, having to compete in the doped up rat race.[deleted]White collar workers are just lying about how busy they areTo appear to be working as much as possible. Because if true efficiency was the goal, that nap would be mandatory instead of trucking along at 20% brain capacity for the dayMaking sure my self-worth depends entirely on my performance at work is also effectiveIt's because we place our self worth in line with what we accomplish.So basically all human societies ever?Funny how our entire society revolve around making sure that you are given the least amount of the value you generated through your work.Work makes us happy, the problem is your definition of workFucking hilarious.With work from home I don't even need a nap because I get an extra hour and twenty minutes of sleep not having to clean up first thing in the morning or commute. I guess in lieu of a nap, I do take a midmorning or lunch time shower though.That's what I do, since I was given the option to work hybrid.Then why are the most popular drinks at any cafe over half milk and sugar?Right? Tea is the goatnaps arent supposed to last more than 20-25 minutes. if you are exceeding it, then thats why.LPT: ween off slowly, don\u2019t quit cold Turkey. Caffeine withdrawals are real.Because reddit is full of shit and drinking a cup or two of coffee in the morning is not detrimental to your health at alli eat my lunch at my desk and THEN clock out for lunch and take my nap. hows that  corporate AMERICA?!?!Lol not every latin american country has tropical weather. Get your facts rightI did the same as a kid. Kept me sane throughout my school life.That\u2019s a _long_ nap. How many hours do you sleep at night, if I can ask?I'm willing to be there's no \"keeping awake\" effect for the majority of coffee drinkers, the tolerance must be through the roof. It's just a habit thing, and habits are hard to break.Me at 3 am basicallySmart honestlyYou have good taste!It's absolutely a cultural difference.> jajajajajajajaI worked for a Fortune 50 company that announced they were doing away with the free coffee service because austerity. It lasted 2 weeks. Everybody just left to go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, sometimes multiple times a day. And the genius that came up with this idea probably got a bonusDefinitely notYou are thinking of China. Factory workers usually sleep after lunch I think.I don't think so. Pretty sure you're considered \"hard-working\" for taking naps over there since the only time they do it is when they've collapsed from exhaustionPassenger planes can last for decades with proper maintenance, and many modern jets were designed assuming a certain average passenger weight. Americans are getting so fat that the extra weight is impacting fuel consumption and range and airlines have had to change operations to address this. High fructose corn syrup in in *everything.* but in Japan for instance, it is banned in foodstuffs as \u201cnot suitable for human consumption.\u201dThat\u2019s not capitalism. Its been like that since forever.Tf? You can take a nap under capitalism \ud83d\ude02And on their other side, while I do live in a country that consumes coffee with the best of them, I don't drink coffee or tea and I don't nap. Food works for me :)[removed]There\u2019s also studies that say lack of sleep also leads to Alzheimer\u2019s\u2026Sauce?Came here to say the same thing. Just read about it today and it's older people who take mid-day naps that are more susceptibleDude last I checked, everything causes Alzheimer's...Add a little Bailey's to it for a delicious contradiction in a mug!This is the truest thing. Mfers are goofy \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f i literally put lil almond milk in mine n call it a day.Don't stop hitting the nail, caffeine is plenty part of its problem too. Considering it elevates stress, inflammation and blocks your  sleep receptor from working correctly, causing your brain to keep overworking. Suddenly you got the caffeine crash, but that's not a problem if you take caffeine again. Oh well, you can sleep just fine right? That's why you have those eye bags in the mornings. Oh Nevermind, you can just drink coffee more in the morning anyway. \n\nIncoming down votes as usual.Agreed you Americans are sugar overloaded.  I typically just drink black coffee and I'm able to take naps while drinking it.  Love having it for after dinner dessertIt's got some good ones too.  People who drink regular coffee are less at risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Parkinsons, strokes, altzheimers, and a couple specific cancers.  It's also been found to be good for the liver.  It's definitely an all things in moderation situation though, it's not good for you to be  putting down multiple cups per day.  To my knowledge the only well established potentially negative health outcome for more moderate intake is increased blood pressure- which is mostly only relevant if you're already hypertensive or close to it.15 minutes is like rebooting a computer. It gives your brain a refresh without starting sleep that's too deep.As long as it's not a bedOr if it was prescribed by a doctor.Baby methI just learned today that in Japan, taking a nap at your desk is seen as proof that you've been working hard.In Korea too, however the working hours are horrible due to their rapid post-war industrialization. Not enough hours in the day, basically.Yep I lived in VN for a year and a half, my first day @ my first job in Hanoi I walked out of the studio where I'd been filming, back into the office, to find all the lights off and literally like 30-40 people napping. I was SO CONFUSED \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Now I embrace the midday nap.As someone who frequently almoat falls asleep at their desk, I really wish this was normalised here.We also pump ourselves full of caffeine lolGeorge?How long do these naps tend to be? I find myself waking up groggy if I nap middayI've just woken up from a 20 minute nap in my work van. I feel great.Wait, really?\n\nTime to move!You have beds under desks ? As someone with medical sleep issues that sounds like a dream/George Costanza has entered the chatGeorge Constanza did itSaw a documentary once about a small electronics manufacturer in China. After lunch everyone just took a nap at their workstation.Lol, they haven't heard the power of my obstructive sleep apnea.  10 minutes in and under-the-desk naps would be banned.I work remote most days and I definitely take a 35 minute nap in my own bed at home every day and I definitely agree. I feel like I've taken a shot of espresso when I get up from it.I\u2019m in the US and a few years ago, I got an ear infection and was on a high dose of amoxicillin. It really wiped me out and I needed a nap at work. We have no place to lay down here and I park too far away to use my car to nap in, so I curled up under my desk on my lunch. My boss was so concerned she woke me up to ask if I was ok. Never lived it down.I used to nap in my car for lunch everyday. Now that I work from home, I throw a show on during lunch and set my alarm for 45 minutes and pass out. Love it. Would not change a thing.Out of curiosity is that considered company time or time you have to make up later? \n\nSo feel free to nap between 12 and 2 but make sure you do 2hrs extra later in the day?\n\nIf so, I'll just take the coffee to keep awake and stop work with enough of the evening to enjoy.In my old startup we had a space for people to sleep in. Worked great. We also had a room to smoke weed in, so that also helped.In China it's common to go home for lunch, eat and nap. The city slows down around lunch.\n\nNot sure how common it is and maybe dependent on industry, or what people do if they don't live near their work. But at least it's socially acceptable.Idk about you but when i wake up from a nap i can\u2019t even tell you my last name, got no idea tf\u2019s going onMore like staying alive in a place where humans really ought not live anymore because damn 50 degreesLiving la vida!I remember the perils of trying to go out for lunch on holiday and all the cafes being closed at middayTo be fair the rest of the country gives them shit for taking siestas so seriously and considers them lazySo many cities honking is just normal... WHYNo it's notStudies show napping makes employees happier and more productive. But American work practices are based on power and cruelty, so \u2026I personally don\u2019t want a long break in the middle of the day. I\u2019d rather go home earlier.Theres 3 brain cells spent on it.... Greece for example has a reputation of being ''lazy''.... motherfucker have you went there it's like 40celsius straight during the summers ofcourse places like denmark are going to outproduce it in the modern economy you can't physically work 10 hours straight  because you die, thus the siesta cultures, at the end of the day it raises the production if anything... and you know that whole mental health thing that apparently exsistsThey do, but on the other hand it is very bureaucratic and annoying for things to get done in many of those countries as a result. You need a document signed? The company who needs to may be on a one month vacation and can\u2019t sign it until then. Also no 24 hour stores, limited things open on Sunday, there\u2019s a lot of trade offs In Terms of convenience and ease of getting tasks doneCan we adopt this in Arizona then?I swear half the time you can be done with like, effective productivity after like 5 hours. After that it's just waiting for the clockI used to work in a warehouse, it was overall a pretty shitty job but I had a full hour for lunch and we were conveniently located next to a park. I'd head over there, eat my lunch, set up my hammock between some trees, set an alarm on my phone, and take a nap.\n\nI was actually a little surprised because i worked with a bunch of Latino immigrants and none of them ever seemed to take advantage of the chance to take a quick siestaI wonder if companies could use sleep as a form of payment.\n\nInterviewer: We pay $12/hr\n\nApplicant: I can't live off that!\n\nI: Plus naps\n\nA:......how long and how many?People that get paid lunches can have it interrupted at anytime. So I\u2019d rather not be paid and know that I have the full time uninterrupted.I'd rather not have to spend an extra hour of unpaid time at workNot that scenario, but coworkers will occasionally take the opportunity to mess with you.Mine sexually assaults me on my lunch breaks, but I'm not even mad.Yours aren't?Let me strain to imagine such a world /sBeats the sports team banter and jokes about people's ties.\"Used to\" huh?You can combine the two into the power move of a Coffee Nap. Drink some coffee and immediately before it kicks in, lie down and take a nap. The nap and coffee team up to fight the sleepiness.Same. I'll spend 45 minutes trying to fall asleep and then whether it's 30 minutes or 3 hours later when I wake up, I feel like shit and I'm grumpy.I was going to top comment this but worth noting now: different people can take different kinds of naps. I think it's about as different as types of earwax, being left handed or hair texture. I don't have any studies to back me up; this is observed behavior and self reported data, but I'm pretty sure I'm right.Also how are people falling asleep in less than 30 minutes after drinking a cup of coffee? In addition to apparently waking feeling less tired and not more tired and groggy after only half an hour or less sleep I find this very hard to believe.2 to 3 hours? A full sleep cycle is really only about 1 hour 40 minutes, though.\n\nHow long are you sleeping during the nap? 20 min is usually the max to avoid the grogginess.Same. Never unferstood how one of my workers could go for a 30 minute power nap at mid day, if I did that the last thing I would be up to was going to work again. \n\nIf it works for him good for him, but it sounds like hell for me.How do people even fall asleep so quickly and how do they not get up 6 hours later.2-3 hour \"naps\" are actually pretty bad in terms of feeling refreshed.\n\n\n The optimal time is [10-30 minutes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16796222/). 10 minutes for a quick refresher, 30 minutes for prolonged benefits with minor sleep inertia just after waking up. Best time is around [2 PM](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11382874/), and worst time is around 7 PM. Bear in mind that individual results will vary.I can't sleep while its light out unless I'm in complete darkness or sick.\n\nMy wife keeps urging me to take naps, but the only time I can is if something is very wrong.Same here, I always wake up with what I call a \u201cnap hangover\u201d unless I\u2019m out for 3-4 hours. Also caffeine doesn\u2019t work on me. So I just have to power through and then go to bed at like 9 pmRight?! If someone told me to take a 30 minute nap with only 90 minute window I\u2019d just lay there anxiously the whole time thinking about how little time I have.Same. It would take longer than my nap time to fall asleep & then you wake up feeling worse.And the biggest part of that cup helping in the morning is the water lol, almost everyone wakes up dehydrated.Stimulant tier list plsThis is a very common effect of dehydration. If you're dehydrated caffeine straight up does not work.I had a similar reaction to coffee and later was diagnosed with ADHD and found that as a common symptomI don't understand how so many people do these 20 min naps. If I lie down midday it probably takes me 30-45 mins just to fall asleepI feel bad for the people in this chain. I never take naps. I don\u2019t need them. But yesterday I didn\u2019t sleep because my stomach was hurting. Got 3 hours. \n\nEventually I was so tired that I fell asleep for an hour. Late in the afternoon. After the hour was up, I felt so much better. While my mom who also took a nap, was tired and groggy. \n\nI wonder if it has to do with all the caffeine people drink. I don\u2019t ever drink anything with caffeine.If I lay down for just 10-20 minutes I can pretty much guarantee that no sleep will have occurred during that time.that sounds like drinking coffee but with an extra step also wasting 20 minutesThat's a sleep, mate. Naps are most effective between 10-30 minutes, in the afternoon. Beyond that is when you start to feel sleep inertia and grogginess when you wake up.Naps, mess me all up \n\nOnce I go down\n\nDon't want to get back up\n\nDon't want to get back up\n\nFeel groggy the rest of the day\n\nWish I never got up.Snore louder for the back rows brother.I take a nap every fuckin day and I love it.  Genx coder. I do more actual work in six hours than many do in sixty.The caffeine doesn't give people the edge they think it does. In fact over time they will have much less energy than you. I drink a single cup of coffee every morning and I still notice that it's much more difficult to become \"awake\" than it was before.\n\nPeople who drink 5 or 6 cups of coffee a day for years don't gain energy from it, they are just getting back to baseline.People in general are not suited for 8 hours of workingIt will all be over within your lifetime. Don't worry.Caffeine is a net negative in energy, if you can't stay awake for 8 hours at a time there's something else wrong, not your caffeine levelTalk for yourself, I don't even have a job \ud83d\ude0eAn office job, which usually pays a living wage or higher, depending on the level, is much more chill than a minimum wage job, like a customer service role. \n\nHave done both and remember taking many coffee/tea breaks in the office, because there wasn't much work to fill the day. As a server, some days I'd kill just to sit down foe 5 minutes in my 9 hour shift! Of course I couldn't stand the boredom of office work, so it's my own fault, I suppose...I'm 27 and have had about 4 jobs since college. The more money I make the less work I end up having to doI work in IT, in total in one day I work around 10-15min.\n\nRest of the time im just waiting, checking youtube/reddit/twitch or learning something. Assuming nothing was time sensitive I think I could skip work for one year and do one year of work in one day.\n\nBut I know that many in other departments of IT are on the edge of burning out.it's not exactly lying about *that*, but rather lying about what they're busy doing actually does. talking people into allowing things to happen can be a tricky business.\n\n\nwriting emails for some jackass who needs their warm fuzzy...it has to be done because they're a jackass and if they don't get the email they'll call a meeting, and now you're wasting 5 peoples' time instead of one.\n\nof course, if this jackass could just be giving a beating and a mop we'd all be better off...but then what would we have our valiant email writer do?The rich have their own society, which runs off poor societies effort.Given how much people like sugar, I think it says a lot more that so many people drink black, unsweetened coffee!The same reason why people prefer beer (or even vodka/whiskey/scotch) over everclearBlack coffee slaps though. Tastes like a better version of how rain smells.Yea I only recently learned that. usually have a hard time falling asleep so it will be about 45 minutes during a nap before I do get any sleep then 2 hours later I wake up feeling like I was transported to a different universe. Then I stay up until 4am and end up late to with the next day. Rinse and repeatnah send it. its rough but doable. weather the storm.Big yup. Those headaches are no joke, and just about the only thing that helps them is more caffeine.This is me.  I'm addicted and get headaches as soon as my body realizes it missed the morning cup or I got it too late.  Even worse, my stupid brain immediately drops the headache at the first sip of a hot coffee (must be hot, iced does nothing) even though that's obviously not how it works.\n\n\nFuck I do love me some coffee though.  The morning when you have that little 30 minute period alone to ponder or read or be alone with the smell and warmth?  Mmmmmmmmm[deleted]If American companies were smart instead of needlessly cruel, naps would be part of the work schedule.I certainly envy your no doubt restful sleepA big case of correlation not implying causation. In fact, the causal relationship is more likely the other way around, though also not well-supported by any evidence I'm immediately aware of.That can be true too\n\nLike I been sleepin 4 hrs and napping 2 hrs .. so I\u2019m probably hurtin my chances of not having Alzheimer\u2019sThere's studies indicating sauce may be a leading contributer to Alzheimershttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/03/vicious-cycle-found-between-excessive-napping-and-alzheimers/ maybe I interpret data wrong plz tell meDon't you think the causal relationship is likely the other way around? As in, those susceptible to alzheimers are more likely to nap? No hard evidence suggests otherwise, as it's all just correlation between loosely-related datasets.Can confirm. This post gave me alzheimer's. What were we talking about?The better the coffee, the less I put in it!Nothin worse than a bed head.Meth and amphetamines are two completely different things, I know they are a molecule apart or whatever but trust me. When I take adderall  I can focus and read a book, when I had snorted meth I spent 7 hours pointing a gun at a fence post in my yard until the sun came up and I realized it wasn\u2019t a person on my property.When talking about meth as a drug it sometimes gets a little confusing.  Until Breaking Bad taking Meth in the UK used to refer to homeless people drinking methylated spirits.  Not something any Doc would prescribe.Well, that means I am the best student in my college.Also, falling asleep in a meeting is thought to reflect poorly on the speaker/organiser, not the person falling asleepThis is false and will get your fired\n\nSource: JapaneseI used to nap on my lunch break everyday. I would walk out to my car, set a timer for 30 mins and pull my hat down over my eyes. It was glorious.Dang, so in Japan I'm the hardest worker ever. Used to literally fall asleep at my desk because of some undiagnosed condition lmaoSadly, because it's Japan, that's probably less 'healthy work life balance' and more 'making it physically possible to work 12 hours per day'.I\u2019m moving to japanEven though you didn\u2019t mention it this comment brought back memories of night school\u2026I wanted to just hide in the closet after dinner and not go back hahaha!I wanna bed fort under my desk now!Some tech companies like google have sleep pods in major campuses. Wish it was normalisedHaha sorry to disappoint miladWhatever. That's only half boiling. My blood can probably take that.\n\nEdit: Plus I can cook soup!!Hi, it's only 50C during 1 week a year, we can take it!A monument to the arrogance of man.Honestly, we could learn a lot from this intentional rest/relax time during the day. It sounds divine.I wish it was still acceptable to take a nap mid-day in Greece. Unfortunately we have joined the rest of the world in working 10h straight even in the summer..Australia also gets 30\u00b0C-40\u00b0C summers and we don't have siesta culture...Ha yeah. Here in AZ summer is pretty much never below 40, and yet we don't do the afternoon siesta thing. \ud83d\ude12I had a professor in college who spent two years in Nicaragua, when the class would complain about the lack of A/C he would tell us what it was like at 110f in the shade at 100% humidity. He joked that if you wanted to kill every American and European in the country you\u2019d just bomb the swimming pools.Doesn't sound like a tradeoff a more like basic concepts to me. Excessive convenience shouldn't come at the price of fucked up work-life balance.I'll take those trade-offs[deleted]Why would you be going to the store when you should be having a nap?I'd say closer to 4, but you are correct. I've worked in enough offices to know how much dicking around vs actual work gets done. Especially closer to the end of the work day. 9-5 is a shitty, arbitrary rule.I think a study once said 6.Studies show maximum productivity is work for 53 minutes, rest for 13 minutes. But imagine American managers watching employees nap or play Candy Crush for those 13 minutes. Even when it\u2019s proven to be more productive \u2026 cruelty is the point.*cries in manufacturing*This is true. This is why part time schedules have all those 4 hr shifts. My manager told me once it's more lucrative production wise because people are more tired in the second half of a long shift even after lunch, and its easier to schedule because of no long breaks and of course avoiding that pesky 40h a week cap(so they didnt have to give benefits).When I worked in a warehouse, I built myself a little bungalo on a top shelf under a heater vent.  Used Instapak (the self expanding foam bags) to make thin little mattress and pillow, the vent was warm enough that I didn't need a blanket.  Put boxes of equipment to build walls so no one could see me (my supervisor knew I was up there and was cool with it, but didn't want corporate management to see me).\n\nCalled it my space bed.  Good times.Siesta is primarily a Spain thing, though many Mediterranean countries have been known to partake. Most Hispanic immigrants (in the US) are going to be from Mexico/central America/Caribbean.At my old job it was paid and they could make you come back out if they need you, but it would start the clock over and you'd get a full length break + what you already got.\n\nSeemed pretty fair to me.I have a 2hr break, I come home for napsImagine how quickly nothing could get done in these meetings if everyone was on coke though\n\nAt least the conversation would be excitingDepends who you ask \ud83d\udc40I had never heard of this until I moved in with my gf. She likes to drink a Diet Coke and take a 30min nap. She calls it a caffeine nap and swears by it.Ah yes the  Nappuccino \u2122In that movie Coffee & Cigarettes, there's a scene with two of the Wu-Tang guys and Bill Murray where they're talking about caffeine naps and how they make you \"go real fast in your dreams!\" Such a fun movie.\n\n[found it!](https://youtu.be/Sq12n585aM8)\nIt's Bill Muwway!But now the taste of coffee induces grogginess in me and makes me sleepy.I do this all the time with my ADHD meds. Though personally they don't provide me a big burst of energy anymore, so I'm liable to just keep napping while basking in that slow warming feeling.This is how I made it through my final uni exams. 2 weeks of 2/3 hour long naps a day with 2 red bulls before each one.\n\nAlthough I was pretty mentally unstable by the end of it, and then I slept for 26 hours and missed my entire birthday.\n\nBut the grades were decent in the end so it all somehow worked out.Caffeine orally hits almost instantly if I recall correctlyYou don't have to fall completely asleep. Even just lying down and closing your eyes helpsIts a skill you can learn\n\nEnough practice and you'll be able to fall asleep standing in half a minuteThe full effect of the coffee doesn't kick in that quickly.\n\nWhat I do is set an alarm for 15-20 minutes, then close my eyes without the expectation of falling asleep. Even a rest like that feels restorative; sometimes I do zonk out, but I don't have the nap hangover that I do if I sleep for an hour or more.Before artificial lighting, effectively nights were longer and humans generally slept in 2 2-3 hour sessions with a 1-2 hour break between them. People would get up and do stuff during that break: sexytimes, or visit with neighbors \u2026 there are historical accounts of this. It also explains why so many people wake up in the middle of the night and can\u2019t get back to sleep right away. Sleeping for 8 hours at a stretch is a recent development.I hear ya, but I think there's no reason they need to complete a sleep cycle if they get all of the cycles they need at night. This is just a nap to rest. But I could be wrong.Yeah if I give myself 30 minutes for a nap I'll fall asleep 25 minutes into it because I'm uncomfortable about taking a nap in the first place, then be really pissed when my alarm goes off 5 minutes later.\n\n\nI love the idea of naps, but I can only take one in a perfect storm of circumstances, and if I do get any actual sleep I usually wake up thinking of nothing but how I'd love for the nap to have been hours longer, groggy and grumpy.Usually it takes me half h to fall asleep....10-30 min nap ain't happeningI've always taken 30-45 to fall asleep since I was a kid (not anxiety my brain just shuts off slowly). I envy people who fall asleep in 8 secondsI see people say this, but water doesn\u2019t help me the way coffee does for grogginess.This is a warning that stimulants are so fucking amazing you will wish you never tried them because you will never ever reach that excitement, motivation and feeling that this is how you are supposed to  be and something was just missing in your life until now.\n\nTLDR: Drugs are not bad, drugs are too good.Ah\n\nThat'll explain it\n\nI need to fuckin drink waterYou don't necessarily fall asleep. I have always been able to nap effectively. Set a timer for 20 to 25 minutes, and start it as soon as you lay down. Be in an environment where you won't be disrupted easily. When you close your eyes, just think very deeply about whatever mundane thing is on your mind like what your next phone upgrade will be and why, or where you would like to go on vacation. And just really work it out in your head, keeping your eyes closed and trying not to toss and turn.\n\nWhen the 25 minutes are up just get up, drink a large glass of water and see how you feel a half hour later. Don't focus on falling asleep, that's not really the goal at all, you want to hit the first couple stages of sleep before getting into a deep one. If you need a deep sleep, you have to rest for over an hour, ideally 1.5hrs.As far as I know it has nothing to do with caffeine intake? I always assumed it had something to do with how different people's sleep phases differ? But I honestly don't know. It's just some armchair hypothesis really.For me, there's no knowing. Sometimes I wake up well rested and refreshed, others I wake up groggy and tired. Sometimes I also sleep longer than I intended, and then I feel like I wasted my day :(\n\nI drink caffeine when I have the time to make coffee, but mostly because I like the flavor. I drink Bedouin or upside-down coffee, 1-3 a day.I can\u2019t do more than 15 mins. Any longer than that and I go into a deep sleep and I\u2019m groggy or I don\u2019t then sleep properly at night.I never have caffeine either (has never worked for me, I don't bother) but I also get groggy when napping and usually after sleeping in general. I do really struggle to sleep though.You don't actually have to sleep while taking a nap, your body can still rest when you relax, lie down and close your eye.\n\nNapping for hours actually make some people more tired after waking upFrom what I understand the first stage of sleep doesn't really feel like sleep. When I lay down for 20 minutes I feel like I'm aware the whole time but I'll wake up with notifications on my phone and I don't remember hearing it vibrate at all[deleted]Any tips on self learning? Currently in IT but I don't want to do this for the rest of my life.Try decaf. When you have no caffeine tolerance at all, decaf still gives you a slight jolt in the mornings.Yeah for me caffeine us a day extender not a starter.\n\nThe idea of needing something extra just to...wake up is just weirdpeople are fully suited to work around the clock, just not the same things continuously and not in a breakneck speed.  \n\nthe 8 hours block for highly specialized work is not what we were made of. but it is the simplest from the efficient solutions that we have so far, so it is prevailing (for the time being).please expandAnd how is that working out for you?Same. Its crazy how much some minimum wage customer service jobs give. Kids sometimes work for 6 hours after school and then have to come home and do homework! Im so glad i never had to do that but ive had cooworkers that do and its just insaneWhile I don't doubt your experience, I'd caution against assuming all white collar jobs are like this.  Most days I start off stressed about which of my tasks have no chance of being done that day, and once I've made my peace with what I can actually achieve that day I'm like [this guy](https://youtu.be/f4CizzE-zZo) fending off all the people who have one reason or another to interrupt me as I set about getting that work done.\n\n\nI have also worked minimum wage jobs in foodservice and other areas, and no doubt they work the shit out of you most of the time for that minimum wage.  But although many things are better about the job I have now (including pay) it's not lower stress most of the time, it's just a different sort of stress.Yea because at some point you get paid for what you know not what you physically can do.Which department do you work that allows most of your work to be automated while others work isn\u2019t? Just Curiousdo you have a recording telling people to turn their computer off then on again?A fact that makes me ever angrierYeah, you don't buy Starbucks because you enjoy the taste of their coffee, if you cared about that shit you'd have your own espresso machine.This guy ~~suffers from~~ enjoys having synesthesia.Eh I had a serious coffee addiction\u2026tried to quit cold Turkey.  Explosive diarrhea, brain zaps, extreme fatigue, intense headaches, no focus \u2026 like 3 days straight. Had to go back on the sauce to even make it through the work day. Ended up tapering it over like 2 weeksThat\u2019s more of a cultural thing than a \u201ccapitalism bad\u201d thing. Some companies allow you to negotiate hours. If anything you\u2019re arguing that we need more economic freedom, hence more capitalism.[removed]Key word: **excessive** nappingVery interesting thank youHere's the conclusion from the actual paper (emphasis, mine):   \n\n------------------  \n\nResults  \n\nOlder adults tended to nap longer and more frequently with aging, while the **progression of Alzheimer's dementia accelerates this change** by more than doubling the annual increases in nap duration/frequency. Longer and more frequent daytime naps were associated with higher risk of Alzheimer's dementia. Interestingly, more excessive (longer or more frequent) daytime napping was correlated with worse cognition a year later, and conversely, worse cognition was correlated with more excessive naps a year later.  \n\n\nDiscussion  \n\nExcessive daytime napping and Alzheimer's dementia may possess a bidirectional relationship **or** share common pathophysiology.  \n\n------------------  \n\nIn other words: They proved the correlation, not the causation. In eli5: \n\nThey don't know if starting to get Alzheimers makes you sleep more during the day, or if sleeping a lot during the day gives you Alzheimer's, or if sleeping a lot during the day makes you develop Alzheimer's quicker if you were going to get it anyway, or if there's a combination.  \n\nAll they're saying is that if a 60-year-old person is suddenly starting to sleep a lot more during the day, there's a higher chance he has Alzheimer's than if he slowly and steadily increases nap times over several year's.ExactlyYeah that\u2019s what the person dressed as a fence post wants you to believeMeth itself is also prescribed, just less popularThe person you replied to may have been talking about meth.  It's prescribed under the brand name desoxyn, although the doses they give out are lower than the equivalent amphetamine doses.  From what I've read, it apparently feels like a smoother, longer lasting Adderall.\n\nYour experience probably has more to do with the fact that you snorted it tbh.  I'm guessing you also took way more.Biggest difference between the two is potency. Effects are similar.Of course. But if you took a comparable dose of methamphetamine, orally, I bet you'd be able to sit and read a book. \n\nNot trying to advocate for using meth to study, your comparison just doesn't make much sense.It *certainly* doesn't help the confusion when methylphenidate - the other common treatment for ADHD - can also be abbreviated as \"meth\".These Western professors are underrating just how much hard work you're putting in, unlike the glorious Nippon corporate culture.\"Japanese rules bitches!\"\n\n\n *takes nap*Damn you know there\u2019s one guy in the office that just hits the most exaggerated snore when the dude he hates is presenting somethingAbout meetings, in Germany it us totally ok to leave it if it reaches the end of work day time. It is the fault of who organized the meeting, not yours.And someone drinking underage or otherwise illegally at a bar is generally their fault, not the bar's.Well, yeah, you get a bunch of people in a room, then just stand there sleeping in front of them, its a weird power move, but kind of a bad look.\n\nPS, I know what you actually meant.Seems to depend on the company. Lots of snoozers where I work. I have yet not found any correlation to them being hard workers.I was skeptical myself. from hearing of the infamous work stress brutal work culture and allYeah, I\u2019m with you on this.\nI don\u2019t know where this concept came from; maybe it was true in the past, but now you\u2019d get a few warnings, and then have to sign a written warning, then get fired.\n\nSource: work for a Japanese company in Japan.I always read that was the case of it was night time not during the day. Is their truth to the sleeping at your desk late at night being normal?I used to do this in college.\n\nSometimes I'd have an hour long gap between lectures and instead of hanging out I'd just go to my car, lay the seat back and pass out.Eating is important too\u2026Narcolepsy?Try 14+ hours, but it's not *quite* as bad as that sounds in my experience:\n\nThe office based company I worked for had showers and a laundry in the basement, so you rocked up to work and *then* got ready for your day. Mid morning you'd go out for breakfast/coffee, then out for lunch, then out for an earlyish dinner with a beer, and back to work until 8-9pm or so, before going home and coming back in for 6am or so, 5 or 6 days per week.\n\nThe expectations are ridiculous, but the life wasn't quite as bad as I anticipated - provided you can get cameraderie with your colleagues and provided you don't have a family.\n\nFrom what I understand though, this was a *good* company: They for example did have a culture of power napping which isn't normal, and there were places set aside for this in the office. Possibly the difference between a low paid office job and a low paid software development job? Who knows, but this ends my TED talk about working for WNI Weathernews in the mid 2000s.What if I sleep through 9 of those hours?12 hrs? Those are rookie numbers.Their work culture ia horrible and leads to an increased suicide rate..... this is the one of the very gew positives they have.do not move to japan for its work cultureI worked at a hagwon till 10pm some nights in 2013. I feel for night-school you.They are really cool and I started doing research on them because I wanted one in my home to drown out the noise of my brother's kids... Until I started reading how there are ones where you have to enter employee ID numbers so your employees only nap enough to maximize productivity and you can monitor their time. Seemed almost dystopianI heard that it's because they don't want their workers to leave campus so that they're always working; hence the super nice amenities (e.g. 24 hr gyms, cafeterias, etc.). They're also expected to always have their laptops on their person too. If anyone knows for certain please confirm or correct me.Anything above 36 and I'm spending the whole day inside. While all of July and half of August stay firm at around 45. While I was born in a desert, for some reason I cannot tolerate it. The sun can fuck right off. I need to move to a more temperate country.Same in spain the birthplace of the siesta, we just do a 8 to 5/6 (which thanks to commute is more like 7 to 6/7) thankfully I work from home and I can do a quick nap without anyone find outYeah the whole economy being crushed for years due to global birocracy does that to a countryso how's your guyses mental health doing?Thats cause most of you are descended from us Brits. And our solution to anything over 20\u2070C is to get completely shitfacedGotta stay away all day to avoid getting killed by one of your hundreds of deadly animals.\n\nAlso gotta stay awake at night, for the same reasons.Y\u2019all leave your AC home/office/car besides trips to the pool during that time?This exactly. I left the US 6 years ago and one of the biggest shifts I've noticed in myself is less urgency & stress about pointless things. So I can't buy something I want on Sunday.. ok chill, I'll get it tomorrow? Americans have heart failure anytime anything isn't available RIGHT NOW. People don't realize the steep price they pay for all these conveniences and how sick it is to live in a society that prioritizes profit & instant gratification over balance, worker's rights, and a more laid back lifestyle.Like practically everything in life, It Depends. \n\nIt depends on how those extra work hours are handled. Do they just give their emplpyees 12 hour shifts? Or do they get extra employees for shorter shifts?\n\nPersonally, I'm a night owl and couldn't care less if it's the weekend or Tuesday. So I'm perfectly suited to taking those shifts instead of having to work someone else to death. \n\nI know there's definitely less wiggle room when it comes to corporate positions in America, but otherwise the issue comes down to the individual most of the timeBecause it\u2019s a guaranteed free time in my day so when I go home from work I can relaxIt honestly really is, and it's just a waste of everyone's time. You spend the last hour at least, checking the clock, seeing if it's reasonable to just leave. It's so dumbMonday, gitta set aside time for the potential fires from the weekend.  Thanksfully there are none.\n\nTuesday, meetings day.\n\nWednesday, actual work time.\n\nThursday, More meetings\n\nFriday, can't do anything super critical just before the weekend.Im the opposite, I don\u2019t really do anything untill after lunch. Though yah, the last hour of the day nothing happens either.Must be nice.... Steel mill your busy from clock in to clock out and then the next shift pics up your where you left off.I'd rather not have my work day be two hours longer just for breakI used to work split shifts. 8am-12 4-8pm.\nIt was great!\nTired? Plenty of time to have a nap.\nStuff to get done? It's light, and shops are still open.Your girlfriend might have undiagnosed adhdYup dunno what these guys are sayin100%. Turns out \"resting my eyes\" isn't a euphemism for a napHow? I legit can't fall asleep during the daytime.i've literally practiced it for 28 years, and it still takes me a good 20 minutes to keep the thoughts away long enough to drift off.Then you might have heavy withdrawal, should go away if you skip caffeine 3-4 days.Coffee having no effect is also a sign of ADHDThis is the right answer here. 20-25 minutes. At the end of which, you might think to yourself, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t even fall asleep.\u201d That might be true, but you did likely drift off. That\u2019s the goal and will you refresh you. Any longer than that and your drifting off will turn into deeper sleep, and you\u2019re going to wake up groggy if you don\u2019t complete a full REM cycle (ca. 1.5 hours). \n\nWhen I need sleep, those are my two options: 20 minutes or 1.5 hours (or a multiple of it). Even at night, rather than sleep till the last possible moment, I set my alarm for either 6 or 7.5 hours after I go to bed.As someone who hasn\u2019t drank caffeine most of his life, anytime I nap I wake up groggy>I always assumed it had something to do with how different people's sleep phases differ? \n\nI feel like it's true. The time it takes for someone to refresh with a short nap is different. If you sleep too little then you are not rested, but if you sleep too much and wake up during the heavy sleeping phase it will mess you up too (I would have severe headache). I guess the sweet spot to wake varies from person to person, from about 30 mins to 1 hour.I was struggling with tiredness during the day last year, so I got a sleep study done. What I discovered is that I just don't sleep well. There was no pathology associated with it, no restless leg syndrome or sleep apnea, I just need *more* sleep than the average person. In an 8 hour stint in bed, I get about a solid 6 and a half hours of sleep. The way the sleep doctor explained it to me this is on the extreme low end of what's still considered \"normal\", and therefore isn't a sleep disorder.\n\nSimilarly, naps don't work for me at all. If I lay down to take a nap it will end up being 4+ hours, and I'll still be groggy when I wake up. I limit caffeine to exactly 200 milligrams a day, at 0615 AM, and never after that. I just don't sleep well.\n\nThe doctor's only advice was to go to bed even earlier. Not really compatible with my life, you know, being an adult and shit, so instead I just... am tired, usually. Kind of a huge bummer.But when does that stage even start. It takes like 1-25 minutes for my brain to even get to that stupor type state once it hits the pillow.**\"The three great virtues of the programmer are laziness, impatience and hubris.\"**\n \n-Larry Wall, inventor of perl\n \nHumility ain't on the list, pal.You'll learn to code when you have a burning project idea that you want to make into reality.

And alzheimer's is such a scary and heartbreaking disease that we _really_ don't need additional fear around it, based off of flimsy conclusions.FINALLY I understand why my cats keep forgetting I fed them already. They're just sick!\n\nPoor boys...My father had hardcore Alzheimer\u2019s and he napped a lot. I realize there isn\u2019t *causation* (just like there isn\u2019t a causation of cigarette smoking and lung cancer, but the correlation is strong enough that anyone with a brain would draw the conclusion to not smoke cigarettes) but I\u2019m personally still gonna refrain from napping and just stick to chunks at night. \n\nYou really aren\u2019t tryna give up nap time huh lolNot really tho, meth also affects serotonin alongside dopamine so it's more of a drug to get high than amph. I mean you can obviously get high on amph but it might not be as good as meth because it only affects dopamine.It shouldn't be tho, it should be abbreviated as mph.[deleted]*yeah!* I think this is such a huge respect thing, too. If your meeting runs long, make another one. Don\u2019t assume everyone else has nothing better to do than talk to you.\n\nIt\u2019s cool to hear about this as a cultural thing. Thanks for sharing!I've been in meetings SCHEDULED after work hours. American work culture is cancer.Oh boy. here in the US you'll be forced to stay until it's over. Usually the meeting is put together by management and they only care about their goals, not your needs as an employee. Also a lot of meetings are held pointlessly when they could have been a notice via e-mail, hence the meme.I only know this through documentaries about Japanese products, but it seems like it's really dependent on who you work for and what's expected of you. The last one I saw about the creation of some of the original playstation games (so mid 90s) had the team working literally 24/7, so you were *definitely* sleeping under your desk.\n\n... That said the only reason why is because you were working too hard to even go home. The work environment was so \"loose\" that you could absolutely \"nap\" or sleep during the day, but it was only like that because work was basically constant. Some people lived off the food in the building vending machines for over a month....But hey at least we got some of the  greatest video games of all time from it..?I used to do this. Sucks in the extreme summer/winter though.Two 15 minute breaks one 30 min lunch\n\nSnack on breaks. Sleep on lunch. Better yet, snack on the work floor. Sleep on all three.\n\nBetter yet. Foam roll and stretch during breaks in empty exercise room during day.Yea people tell you not to self diagnose but also when you cant afford to see a doctor.. WebMD it is I guess lol.Chronic fatigue will do it all on it's own.  E.g. I have sleep apnoea and fibromyalgia and I basically can't stay awake some days.  Doesn't need to be as severe as narcolepsy, that shit will cause injuries from you faceplanting the ground randomly.Genuinely interesting, thank you.That still sounds like a nightmare to me: 9:00-6:00 is a schedule for being *at* work, not *away from* work.  I don\u2019t have a family, but I don\u2019t think I could put up with that for more than a week or so unless I was getting a salary in the $200,000 USD range, maybe more depending on cost of living in the area.I worked a job as a govt contractor overseas where it was 12hr days, 7days/week (we got a \"half day\" once every two weeks) and in my experience when you work people crazy hours like that productivity isn't really any better than a 40hr week. People just fuck off more with that extra time.They should just provide housing at the company. It doesn\u2019t seem employees get much life outside work.It seems to be similar to how \u201csleeping on the job\u201d is treated in Korea. Most bosses would be angry to see this but some higher level jobs, the bosses will see it as \u201cThey\u2019ve worked so hard!\u201d But ONLY if your performance already matches that. You should be ahead of schedule or at least doing very well or else you would not get away with it!\n\nEdit: typoPeople fall asleep at they're desks because they're continuously working overnights due to the terrible work culture. It's only a positive in the sense that it's a mercy.Not even just suicide. There\u2019s also [karoshi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoshi).Honestly just a joke lol I\u2019m not moving anywhere on my own anytime soon. I\u2019m 17Just seems like a huge pain in the ass too. I don\u2019t need a pod. Leave it to tech companies to add an onboarding procedure to a bed. My head resting on my arm as a pillow on my desk is perfectly comfortable for a quick snoozeEnter 20:00 on the pod controls, shut the hatch, then go out to the parking lot and take a 2- hour nap.I saw someone pointing out that Google provides very good diner but the diner starts at like 8pm while normal work hours end at 5pm. They expect you to hang around the campus to wait for the diner and may work while waiting.Lmfao and here I am considering moving to Iceland because anything over 16C is just annoyingly warm and it gets worse every year.Depending on the city I guess. There\u2019s a lot of jornada partida still. But personally as a working parent I avoid that schedule and work 9-18 when I can.Did you mean \"Bureaucracy\", or is birocracy something else?Goddamn Bic and their birocracy, ink cartidges for life!....I'd like the siesta pleaseWe have somewhat of a drinking problemWhen your pool temperature is 100\u2070 because it doesn't get below that at night, even the pool isn't so enticing.Even this isnt a safe bet anymore. Just left a job because I applied for 2-10pm (I cant STAND crowds. I miss both the schoolrush and the rat race). Nope, manager got it in his head that rotating shifts were the way forward. Force your people to work shifts they dont like instead!\n\nYou can guess how well that's worked out for themIf your clock-out time was an hour earlier, you'd still spend the last hour the same exact way.  At least I know I would.Yeah that's kind of crossing the line. Unless I worked from home.\n\nOtherwise no, I like my half-hour it means I'm home sooner.Why would this be something that might indicate that?^ seconded, I do this as well and have diagnosed ADHDYup. I used to do the same, except it was more like a pot of cold brew coffee and a nap. I have adhdLol that\u2019s a stretch of a diagnosis.In this case it just takes a half hour for orally consumed stimulants to hit your blood stream. If you don't fall asleep fast it doesn't work.I'm the same. Once the sun is up, I'm up. Even when I had a newborn and surviving on 3 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period, I couldn't sleep until the sun was down.Join military. Stand guard at a door. Wear sunglasses. You learn quick and fast. /sFor me withdrawal takes about 1 to 2 weeks. Iam sensitive to caffeine and the withdrawal sucks, headaches and feeling energyless.\n\n1 or 2 coffee a week and they feel like small doses of amphetamin. Take more and the effect quickly reduces to just feeling a bit more awake. Its weird how caffeine abuse is accepted as normal around the worldThree to four days is when the withdrawal really starts to kick in. Getting over caffeine takes more like two weeks for me, and it's a shit two weeksSame. I rarely have caffeine and I think I've consumed more alcohol than coffee ever since turning 21 a few months ago. Regardless, I cannot nap. I feel so much worse after napping. It's like my heads gone cloudy and there's no internal headwind to clear it. Never understood how my peers can just nap and then spring up with a full battery.Let's commiserate together - different setup, same outcome. I had a sleep study done where the doc complimented me on my sleep looking \"like the one of a 25 year old\" (whatever that means, apparently people's sleep look worse the older they get?) and no pathologies whatsoever, and in the last 5 years there were about 10 nights when I had nominally enough sleep and didn't wake up feeling like shit (looking the part, too) and not getting super tired over the day. It sucks.I have a friend who is really smart, and he needs a good 10 hours sleep to function normally. Everybody is different.Lol ive said the exact same thing at my job and im a genz/millenial cusper, i just couldnt resist the joke cus its def a stereotypical gen x thing to say (i got it from my mom myself lol)Only if its bad coffee. I get Boyers decaf Columbian and its just fine.\n\nThats a local brand though so your milage may vary, but my point is there is good decaf.What decaf are you drinking.. there's good decaf out there that tastes exactly like normal coffeeEver ate rat poison?neither does anyone else....it's why they can't call you out on it.Work on that and you can make even more money doing even less things in the future :)\n\nI work 10-15min a day at my 8-12 hour shifts. I spend around 4 hours a day learning new stuff so I can get better paying jobs.C'mon Ruth! Lol!Withdrawals may trigger the migraine as wellChances are you\u2019re gonna get that or dementia if that vaccine don\u2019t cut your life short soonerBoth have effects on serotonin receptors, but little compared to dopamine. Look it up. (They affect monoamines and indoleamines)\n\nThe difference between amphetamine and methamphetamine is that the methyl group makes methamphetamine more fat soluble (faster absorbtion), and that methamphetamine metabolyses into amphetamine (longer effect).\n\nMethamphetamine itself seems to release a bit more dopamine than amphetamine, so increased potency too i guess. (im not completely sure about this one, might have read it wrong, and it could be caused by the effects mentioned in the other paragraph)\n\nNow there are small differences between different isomers of amphetamine, but for the most part, amphetamine and methamphetamine have similar effects, with one being easier to abuse.That's a good pun but all I can think about is nipples from NipponApply directly to the foreheadI really hate the idea that walking out of a meeting right at 5 would be viewed as highly disrespectful when it's actually far more disrespectful to have a meeting that keeps me at work late and then feel that's a totally acceptable thing to do.I had a completely incompetent boss who got pissed at me and scheduled a one on one status meeting every Friday at 5:00 just to be a dick. Being a total paste-eater, he probably thought this would piss me off because it would impact my social life. But I had 2 little kids at home and thus no social life. My attitude was \u201cI\u2019m not locked up in here with YOU, you are locked up in here with ME.\u201d He made it to exactly one meeting, then cancelled every week for awhile, then just dropped it.\",since we all have busy work days we can only meet ay 7pm on a weekday or come in on a Saturday to go over [this fucken bull shit that corporate wants ppl to know even though it doesn't change anything] btw, we will have donuts so it's worth it\"Nighfill manager at a supermarket here.\nMy team will literally put down what they are doing and walk out if I try to push them past 5 minutes to finish timeWorking in US be like: *Slaps roof of Lamborghini* \n\"One day if you work hard and give us your every waking moment you too could make your boss enough money to get one of these\"Which is crazy, since I've never met a manager in my life (myself included) that wanted anything to do with staying late for a meeting for any reasonThey could have been better if the team had what they needed and the proper time to do it right. Do you think the Sistine Chapel would look better if Michaelangelo had an efficiency expert with a stopwatch harassing him non-stop?I don\u2019t want to offer unsolicited advice but sleep apnea has many treatments and the advancements in CPAPs and BiPaps comfort has been seriously exponential since I started working in sleep medicine.  I know there are a ton of variables that prevent people from being able to access healthcare if you want any help lmk.Salaries were nowhere near that in my case, but this was also 20 years ago now: I was started on effective \u00a330k at 21 and an apartment was provided for me. Adjusting for inflation would be ~\u00a347.5k. GBP to USD in 2005 was 1 to 1.75, so that's ~$83k.\n\nWhen the company is paying for everything from your food to your washing, the cost of living is largely irrelevant. When you effectively never need to leave the vicinity of the workplace, even your home accommodation is essentially irrelevant and you rack up no real bills because you're never home.\n\nI'm sure I don't need to point out the many drawbacks to a European/American, which is why I'm solely focusing on what it was like to actually live that life, rather than to compare it to how I'd live when performing a similar role in a different region. Likewise life is likely quite different for someone born in the country, and isn't being hired from an overseas office with the intent of making the HQ an \"international\" office.I completely agree.That's fair comment, though I alluded to the somewhat-organic \"solution\" in my post: Cameraderie with one's colleagues. The culture of the \"company-man\" (sarar\u012bman, salary-man) is strong in Japan, and whilst this fairly carries overtones of the lonely drunk, things like team-building excursions and exercises were pretty common during my time there. Indeed I recall one time the company paid for the entire team of 40+ to go skiing on Hokkaido, busing us from the office in Chiba (Tokyo). I'm not implying this is generous or anything like that, but that it was unremarkable for something like this to be organised, and that it inherintly acknowledged how much of the employee's time was consumed by the company.\n\nIf you want to \"get ahead\" in such a culture, your workplace *becomes* your life. Good employers respect that, and try to make that life as good as it can be. As there's little opportunity for a life outside of work, inevitably you form close friendships with your colleagues... or you're probably, at least in my opinion, going to end up lonely and depressed. I think the anecdotal data likely supports this conclusion.\n\nAs for providing housing... it was not at all uncommon to come in the morning after and wake someone up who'd gone to sleep under their desk, prompting them to go downstairs and shower. Commuting in Japan is great compared to many countries, but there were still many people for whom the commute would've meant only getting a few hours sleep...A lot of larger companies do provide company subsidized housing. Makes it easier to convince employees to live separated from their families while doing a rotation at a regional office, etc.Totally. It stems from a bad situation, the benefit could still be applied for better systems. I like the idea of an optional siesta, since people tend to have a dip in energy at some point during their work hours.The fact they made up a word for that kinda says a lot.Username checks outDinner doesn't start at 8 at any major tech company -- FB does 6:30 now, apple does 7. I think google does 6:30 as well.   \n\n\nThe point isn't for people to hang around at the campus waiting-- its for people who are still there, who otherwise might have had to deal with an interruption in their flow.   \n\n\nFor example, my friend over at apple has her meetings interspersed from 5pm to midnight since she meets with a lot of their china team.   \n\n\nI personally worked out from 4-6 and then showered and headed to dinner.   \n\n\nAt big tech companies people also stroll in at late hours -- we have breakfast from 8-10:15am, so I'm often not working till 10:30.I have no skills that allow me a job at Google\u2026\n\nBut that would be a dealbreaker.\n\nI hate techniques like this.Holy shit. 16C is considered cold (well more like fresh) and when most people break out their long sleeves around here during winter days. Winter nights when it hits around 10 or lower people freak the fuck out. \n\nIf I could live somewhere where 16C was seen as warm, I'd dig my nails in and never fucking leave. (I also have light sensitivity due to a permanently dilated pupil so id also like that place to be cloudy if possible)Really??? What about beach weather? Going out in the sun with shorts and a t-shirt then swimming in the ocean when it's 20-25C out is heavenly.I wonder how much of the world actually knows what a Biro is.>somewhat\n\nUnderstatement of the year. I'm counting both caffeine and alcohol.Depends really, when I used to work retail and I'd get stuck with the four hour shift, I'd have to be reminded that \"times up\" but of course we're comparing your hypothetical 7 to my 4. It just felt like your intention was to say that no matter the length of shift we'd be antsy to leave.People with ADHD sometimes have unconventional experience with stimulants. Caffeine, cocaine, and adderall tend to mellow them out instead of stimulate them. I think it has to do with the stimulants allowing certain brain functions to operate closer to baseline.I doubt it. Half of the guys I deployed with did this with coffee. Watch out for WebMD on RedditAh fuck. I do this and I'm not diagnosed...I totally feel you. I also feel completely out of place after a nap, like this isnt supposed to happen.It does feel like a superpower, doesn't it. Us mortals will never experience this! HahaIsn't it fucking disheartening when the doc is like \"no, your sleep is normal\" and you're like \"but then why does it feel like I want to die every morning when I drag myself out of my bed??\" and the doc is like \"hah lmao idk bro\".\n\nThen you're like maybe it's just me, maybe I'm a lazy piece of shit or something? It's frustrating as fuck. Feels like the opposite of a super power.Napping on nipples from Nippon.My boss will literally START the weekly meeting (which takes a good 3-4 hoirs) like 30 min before quitting time. Inevitably we stay like 1/2hrs late and then have to break off and finish later. Like, why, why think thats a good idea?Hopefully you were hourly and had done the math correctly to ensure that meeting was being paid in OT. Then drag that shit out as long as you can. Hopefully, as an added bonus he then had to explain to his boss why you got overtime that week.Username checks outI absolutely agree, but in this specific case I think it was a \"get it done by X point or we're not releasing it\" situation from Sony, because they didn't really believe in the game. The developer spent every second he could on it to make it the best it could be, which ultimately ended up saving a game that otherwise wouldn't have been distributed. \n\nOf course if Sony allowed unfettered creativity and let them take their time, it wouldn't have been an issue and the game would have been just as good regardless, but it wasn't up to the team. Japan had (and still has) a very toxic work culture, I wasn't at all trying to say that creating the games they did made up for that or anything.The thing is, salaries in Japan are lower in general, but so is the cost of living.\n\nYes, the space that you live in will be smaller, but people really overestimate how much space they actually need to live.\n\nYou can get a decent 1LDK (living room, bedroom, dining and kitchen) for $1,400 a month in a place less than a 10-15 min walk from the main train line that stops at all of the main areas in Tokyo (Yamanote).\n\nConsidering that, making $200,000 wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a necessity. \nThat being said, I would fucking hate working those hours. I already work more than I want to as it is, but that\u2019s just me, and I value my private time.Agreed. I'm also of the general opinion that an hour lunch break is actually not enough. 2 hours is the ideal, even if that is arguably pushing it. At the very least give 15 minutes there and 15 back in getting the food, that way they have the whole hour.Come to Canada!\n\nIt's currently -7\u00b0C.When comparing the average alcohol consumption of the population Australia doesn\u2018t rank that high when it comes to alcohol. They were ranked 30th or something in 2018, behind most European countries.Caffeine increases dopamine in the brain;  people with ADHD can't release dopamine properly, so caffeine helps. The reason people with ADHD can't focus is because they're unconsciously seeking an external stimulus for their brains to release dopamine. Caffeine (and Adderall) increase dopamine, so people without ADHD feel a \"buzz,\" but people with ADHD just feel normal. \n\nYou could be right about the ADHD, but I do the same thing with Caffeine and naps (and I don't have ADHD, to my knowledge). The idea is that if you're super tired, you chug a Caffeine containing drink and nap for 20 to 30 minutes. It takes about that long for the Caffeine to absorb and hit the brain, so you wake up just as the Caffeine starts to work.>Caffeine, cocaine, and adderall\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 One of these things is not like the others \ud83c\udfb5\n\nI have ADHD. About the only thing that works for me every time is a 5-hour extra strength. Literally everything else is hit-or-miss.Can confirm, i have adhd and if i consume a caffeinated drink i might experience a buzz while I'm still drinking it but within 5 minutes of finishing I'll get really drowsy and will often need to have a nap or get some fresh air. Only recently made the connection with adhd and couldn't believe how many people experienced the same as me.Consider yourself, partially diagnosed\u2026Me too lmao. I\u2019ve drank a huge can of red bull and slept a solid 10 hours immediately after it in the past\u2026[removed]I mentioned this in another comment somewhere in here; but I've never met a manager in my life (including me) that ever had any interest whatsoever in staying late for anything less than some grand emergency. Like, it's 5pm... let's GTFO of here. Besides me not wanting to stay late, I understand that nobody else does either and it would be incredibly rude for me to do that to someone.I was salaried.\n\nI could write a book about this idiot. He bullshitted his way through interviews with tons of corporate buzzwords but knew literally nothing of value. A month into the job he made an Excel mistake that made it into our final budget, meaning we had to hit higher sales goals while our budget was slashed by over $300K. He couldn\u2019t even write routine memos, he would call me or another manager in to help him. And he made 3x what I did. The President couldn\u2019t admit he made a mistake hiring him so they paid this guy to eat past basically.Fundamentally it's why I didn't stay for the long-term: I too value my *private* time.\n\nThat said, as another commenter pointed out: The culture isn't of working harder in my opinion, it's... almost one of \"shitting on the company dime\"!Hell no unless the lunch hour doesn\u2019t make the day longer. Yeah I\u2019ll work 6 hours and take two for lunch. But I\u2019m not taking a two hour lunch if it means my day is now ten hours long. Fuck that> an hour lunch break\n\nHour lunch break? I get 30 minutes. Unpaid.Ever since being diagnosed things in my life make sense. I always thought a caffeine buzz or people being wide awake from caffeine  were just jokes, like the term \"sugar rush\" isn't real. Caffeine and sugar basically affect me the same way. I'm get nice and content and sleepy. I can drink a monster right before bed and sleep fine. In fact I always drank caffeine to function and never really noticed feeling more awake.Yeah I think the key difference is whether you're trying to get to sleep before tbe buzz hits or if the caffeine is causing you to go to sleep. People with adhd will most likely experience the latter.Thanks for the infoADHD here. I have no problem sleeping when I've taken my Ritalin or when I've had caffeine. If I have sugar at night though, I won't be able to sleep for ages...I think I need to make a doctors appointment. \n\nFor years, caffeine would never really give me a buzz, there were times when I thought it worked opposite on me because I could take it and be sleepy afterwards.Oh yeah I attempted to make my language generalized but it's worth emphasizing that none of what I said earlier is true for everyone with ADHDAh, but thats probably in a medium-large company. My boss is the business owner, and he works from like 3-8pm, because thats when he wants to work. So he feels like everyone else should do the same, even if thats not our schedule and even though we've been there since the morning and he rocked up well after lunch.Last night I was staying up late with a big can of Monster and somehow just fell asleep and woke up rested.\n\nADHD is weird.I does improve my focus a bit, but not my energy. It's kinda bullshit",

    "Comments": "Just because you only eat plants doesn't mean you won't impale a mother fucker\n\n**edit**: or that you won't impale another herbivore, I've seen a video of an elephant just ram its tusks straight through a buffalo and rag doll it[Jackson\u2019s chameleon](https://lafeber.com/vet/wp-content/uploads/jacksons-chameleon.jpg) uses camouflage but it still wants to be recognized, damnit.Herbivores can be violent.Nasty, mean herbivores.Implying herbivores can't be evil?There's a reason behind it.\n\nThere were several religions who had horned gods (some related to fertility etc).\n\nWhen Christianity started.to spread and gain power, they used many strategies to convince people to convert and leave the older religions.\n\nOne of these was to demonize pagan gods. Basically, a bad rep propaganda to scare people away from other religions.\n\nBesides telling the other gods were in fact demons and evil, they also started to associate those gods features such as horns and hooves with Satan.\n\nThat's why you see many depictions of demons with horns,  and the reason why many people associate horns with evil.wow you\u2019re literally right\u2026 i looked it up lmao\n\nCarnotaurus is the only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on the frontal bone.Square up with a moose or deer. See where that gets you. You'll think after \"maybe those stories had a point.\"Well, there are horned lizards that aren't herbivorous. And some otherwise herbivorous animals will eat baby birds, but for the tasty tasty bones, not their flesh. And there were horned carnivorous mammals, but they're all extinct.This is a quality shower thought.  Take my silver.Clearly you've never met a deer because they are all pricksNarwhal, narwhals...*Carnotaurus tries to enter the chat but is too extinct to do soDon't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.Confirmed! The devil is an herbivoreThe red, goat-headed guy with horns and hooves is Ba'al, the old Syrian god of fertility and such. The church turned him into the image of the devil so they can snuff the opposing ideologies in that region. Christian artists used that template. Just as they used the halos around the saints' heads that been used to identify old Egyptian gods. Almost everything about the Ibrahimic religions is stolen and distorted like this. That's why most of these stuff don't make sense. \n\nI could be wrong, but that's the outline of this contradictory, I think.I knew that the vegans were secretly demons!And in biblical stories, horns represent power, not evil. And power is not evil, unless misused. And yet people wear crosses, which are representative of a brutal execution style. *sigh* many people don\u2019t think past the surface.A charging buffalo or rhino is pretty scaryI thought you were talking about brass instruments in the first part like with movie effects and shit and I was so confused lmaoThe devil is in the detailsWell I mean if you think about it, herbivores kill more things than carnivores do.I could be wrong but I looked into this a bit during one of my projects in school. I read somewhere that in the Bible, goats were painted to be boisterous, unpredictable and stubborn, as well as representing lust and paganism - as opposed to sheep which represented good obedient god-fearing faithfuls.\n\n\"We\u2019ve often heard of goats being associated with witchcraft and Satan himself. The Bible never seems to have many good things to say about this creature (Matthew 25:31-46), so it should come as no surprise that one of the statues of the Satanic temple, known as Baphomet, has a goat\u2019s head. The Baphomet is a goat-like man that was originally created in 1856 by \u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi as an occultic symbol of balance. It became expressly associated with Satanism when it appeared as a depiction of the devil in a tarot card deck.\"\n\nSooo basically evil creatures are given horns thanks to baphomet and the Bible even though horns usually appear on..Less evil animals .Horned Chameleons.herbivore =/= friendly. Just because an animal won't eat you doesn't mean it won't hurt you. Case in point: bulls, rhinos, hippos, etc.A good showerthought that has nothing to do with vegans\u2026and this wretched sub just makes low-effort vegan takes yet again.Believe it or not, unicorns are carnivorous.So carnivores are evil?? Sounds like some vegan propaganda to meyou've never dealt with herivores. they'll fight you bro.What, herbivores can't be evil? Haven't you seen Zootopia? Geez some people.Nothing\u2019s more scary than a vegan satan.Due to Catholic propaganda. The horned god of the people of Europe was subverted, turned into a devil and demonised. \n\nHorns were a sign of fertility. Another thing demonised under Catholicism.\n\nBasically, the horns are there because Catholics waged war on the people, their religion and their history. It was why so many women were burned all over Europe- suppression of the folk of Europe. They burned Wiccans and called them witches and spread evil stories about them to turn the people against them.\n\nFuck the Catholic Church.Demonization of Greek polytheism I'm afraid. Depictions of the devil that include horns and goat feet are stolen from the God Pan.Carnivores are unlikely to attack people unless provoked. Attacks take energy. We don't make good prey, because the effort required to meat payoff is a bad ratio. \n\nSo despite the scary looks, carnivores are typically not a threat to humans. \n\nBut large herbivores? They got energy to spare. They will fuck up your world for no reason other than because fuck you!\n\nIf I'm going to have a chance encounter with a large animal in the wild, the ones with horns are much more terrifying than the ones with teeth.You don't know what the cows didThat's precisely right. A carnivore will kill you because it needs to in order to continue surviving.\n\nAn herbivore with horns will kill you without any necessity. Evil bastards...A moose bit my sister onceThis just proves that herbivores are evil and scary and should be eatenYeah, because pagans worshiped cows and rams and Christianity just portrayed old pagans as devil worshipers\u201cWho says we\u2019re gonna eat him after we kill him?\u201dGood job.I like this showerthought! Have an award.So??? A bull has horns and can easily fuck your shit upNarwhal.Moose are far and away the most dangerous creatures to humans and sled dogs during the Iditarod race.\n\nThey charge at people all the time and stomp/gore the dogs and people quite often.Who said herbivores can't be evil or scary?Herbivores can mess you up,even occasionally killing carnivores.still, if they don't eat you, they'll beat youNot true. My mother-in-law eats meat.My mother-in-law eats meatBecause the truest monsters only eat plants everyday.Rhinos, Hippos and the bull variety are herbivores... They're not the gentlestIIRC this is because of the Christian depiction of the devil wich often involves horns as one of the most prominent features. As the devil represents evil, the symbol of horns over time developed into a symbol of evil in popular Christian folk belief. \n\nThis is also the reason why Vikings (or Germanic pagans in general) were often depicted wearing horns on their helmets in Christian stories. It was a kind of diffamation of the \"enemy religion\".Most carnivores will usually only attack animals they already know in order to eat them. Herbivores are much more likely to attack beings they don\u2019t know since those are scary. There are many, many exceptions to this but it could be sufficient to explain the stories.A hippo is a herbivore, and still an evil motherfucker.Op clearly has never been impaled by a horned animal beforeHow do narwhales fit in here?Now that I think of it, I can't think of a single carnivores with hornBecause teeth and claws aren't the only ways animals can kill people.  And generally animals with horns/tusks are significantly bigger and stronger than we are.I'm just gonna leave [this](https://youtu.be/aWcGEo4OqhU) here.Well at least for the devil I know he has the horns of a baby goat in order to deceive people into thinking his innocent and harmless.And lets be honest. Those herbivores usually ARE the scariest ones, and dangerous.Herbivores kill more people than carnivores by a huge marginWhat can I say, goats are assholesJust because herbivores don\u2019t eat meat doesn\u2019t\u2019 mean they\u2019re not evilVegans are evilSo devil is a vegetarian like Hitler...I mean, evil in stories are mostly based on demons which are based on depictions of the devil which are based on goatsIt's because vegans are evil.Most stories are written by cucumbers.Why do you think \"herbivore\" and \"scary\" are mutually exclusive? Walk too close to a moose's baby and tell me the angry mom isn't scary.Pagan gods often had horns. They also often had hooves or some other animal features. A Lot of them looked like how many of us imagine demons today.\n\nWhen Christianity began spreading across Europe, the church rebranded the old gods as evil or demonic.Have you ever had to deal with an evil goat? Watch VVITCH. That\u2019ll explain exactly where it all comes from.What about horned Dino\u2019s like the carnoThe only horned carnivore I can think of would be Narwhals.There are many carnivore reptile species with hornes\u2026 for instance the HORNED desert viper (Cerastes cerastes), there is Vipera ammodytes, there are many\u2026Ever seen a goat?Several dinosaurs had horns.  I imagine if their skulls were found, it\u2019s precisely what dragons and evil creatures were inspired from.   Stygimoloch (believed to be a juvenile version of a dinosaur I don\u2019t feel like spelling) looks exactly like a dragon skull.I have never thought abt this before! Maybe it was a purposeful tactic back then like \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d to engender trust\u2026?In most cultures Satan is depicted as someone with horns of goat, evil is associated with Satan, so because of that certain demons and evil creatures are portrayed as entities with horns \n\nYou probably knew this already, idk why I said it againSome insectivore Bats have a horncarnotaurus would like to have a chat*Great horned owl entered the chat*[Carnotaurus says Hello](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus)Say hello to my carnivorous friend, *[Carnotaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus)*.So, You're not scared of a Bull Moose or a Buck Deer in Rut?So is Satan an herbivore?Doesn\u2019t that relate to the type of goat that is used to depict satan?

Hence the horns being associated with evil.Well creatures that are meant to be scary don't necessarily eat people. They're often just attacking people or scaring them. \n\nFor instance, elephants, hippos, rhinos, Rams and other animals alike may not eat people, but they definitely are known to attack with their horns.And herbivores are terrifying to protagonistic plants.Have you met a mean cow? It\u2019s not\nHard to imagine them as evil.It's because of the systematic demonisation of pagan deities like Cernunnos.Carnotaurus: \"am I a joke to you?\"The idea that Satan is a Vegetarian is amazingNot long ago there was a video going around that had a deer just demolishing a squirrel and eating it so\u2026 that was a bit spookyBecause carnivores have teeth and claws\"but in nature only (\\*) herbivore have horn\"\n\n(\\*) mammal herbivore ; not counting past carnivore like carnotosaurus\n\n(\\*) not counting the occasional eating of small animalsThis makes sense to me. A predator killing you is dangerous, but part of its natural life cycle. It isn't evil to hunt for food if that is simply your nature.\n\nAn herbivore that hunts for sport or entertainment or to satisfy a moodo lust, however, is much more unsettlingThere was a culture real old . They were pastoralists who would herd their sheep, goats, and buffalos. They have been doing so for real long and had ram and buffalo deities(obviously). The culture lived long enough and communicated well enough to pass their imagery to places near and far. Kingdoms were made and gone but people remembered the symbol of sacredness. The diety with horns. Deities beget deities in ways as weird as possible(ask Greeks) and one less weird way is the deities made by the subconscious. Horned deities remained in sight until some made people realize that holiness cannot dwell in someone so far from the image of man; cause these people had a belief that in his image the man is made. The horned one was ridiculed and ridiculed to such a degree it begat more deities. The deities of heretics. The horns remained for us to look, be afraid and fantasize. The story of the horn goes on and on and is still in making with no less fun and surprise.Ever met a pissed off goat?vegans are devils confirmed?Alright so who linked the vid of the deer eating the baby chick?It's because the Mesopotamians used horns to indicate divinity in their artwork.

A hippo, rhino, wildebeest, moose, etc. will kill you because you exist nearby.I think it\u2019s because you least expect an herbivore to be violentLots of things with horns and antlers are actually omnivorous. Deer are the most obvious example. There are videos around YT that show them eating baby birds etc.So, what, being an herbivore makes you an angel? Someone's never seen a goat in person, then. \n\nThere's a reason demons are often depicted as them.Herbivores are secretly evilwho said herbivores are not evil?Their goal isn't to eat you, their goal is *to kill you*Just because they're herbivores, it doesn't mean they're not scary lol.Satan be chewing the cud on those fresh fresh soulsOn average, You are far more likely to be killed by a deer than a shark or bearnot true, dragons have hornsProbably goats, man.

Like, you telling me that if you were on the wrong end of a rhino's rampage you'd be all like \"Well, it's a herbivore, what could go wrong?\"This reminds me of a video I watched where the person pointing out the fact that if we saw a demon we probably think it would be our friend because we as humans are predators and relate more to other predators like us period that's why we depict demons often with herbivore traits: horns, cloven hooves, eyes on the side of the head rather than forward facing, long muzzles. I just described a goat and yet I could have also easily just describe Baphomet. It's funny to think aboutthere are times when herbivores eat meat tooIn nature, we hominids were often gored to death by the animals we hunted. Stands to reason horns would be considered evil.A lot of \"herbivores\" will totally eat a field mose if it comes across one. Not quite herbivores. Omnivores that mainly eat plants.\nThinking of goats specifically here.Herbivore doesn\u2019t mean peaceful or harmless.Just because you eat plants doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t scary. Buffalo kill more people at Yellowstone than wolves and bears.Herbivores can actually be far more aggressive than carnivores in some cases.  Preditors come out, eat something, go back to sleep.  Herbivores have to protect their space from other creatures that might fuck up their meal zone.Satan a vegan confirmedYou haven\u2019t met my MILTell that to the poor tin can that my grandpa's goat just ate.Maybe it's because stories were traditionally written on paper and paper comes from trees. And herbivores are villains on the eyes of plants and I should stop smoking this stuff.You ever seen a flock of meeses? Things are ruthless.I would much rather face a predator then an herbivore. Both looking me down angrily. \n\nIf I pose no immediate threat and am just treading through there territory unknown. A predator expects a human to run or be afraid I can just go ape shit. Now if an herbavore wants me dead they have no expectations for humans they expect little caution from the human around them. So going apeshit isn\u2019t beyond the relm of expectations. Also the predator might just be hungry but not so hungry it wants to deal with my bullshittery.Incorrect. Deer are omnivores like us and have horns.That's exactly why it's scary.

A different interpretation of Satan is Baphomet, a Prometheus-like archetype who brought intelligence and free will to man. Horns=wisdom=Baphomet\n\nOther people who know more than me will hopefully elaborate on my vague recollection of this. \n\nSaturn is also associated with Satan (the light bringer, not the Christian caricature), and in astrology, Saturn rules over Capricorn, which is symbolic of man coming to grips with his responsibilities, establishing order, and seeking greater heights of accomplishment. \n\nJust my own little rabbit hole here about horns.Well can you imagine if carnivores had them too? Fuck thatEvil characters are given horns because of demons and the devil being depicted with themYou might be on to something!Does Narwhal count?Proof that vegans are evilThat's what makes it scary. It's unnatural. A lion running at you is scary.

This is why showers are important. Get your stupid stuff out before it comes long at the wrong time.Horns are gayNarwhal?Narwale eat fish.Evil is a Christian term. It is unsurprising that most religious depictions of goats, rams, sheep, etc are described in a Christian basis in a Christian culture, even if they are described as having materially negative effects without basis. Op can just read some basic anthropology or biblical text to cure this shower thought\u2014even from a Christian perspective, this is some \"evil\" con-man shit.\n\nOther faiths do not have this morphological hang up, instead looking to behavior for morality. I have no clue how it became acceptable for christians (possibly Jews too?) to act otherwise\u2014probably a result of consolidation of power at some point in history, coupled with some technology to mass produce an allowed images of \"evil\" goats etc on the basis of idol worship.Who's to say Satan isn't vegan?Moose will fuck you up.I\u2019m always horny\u2026.maybe I\u2019m an herbivore.So you\u2019re saying vegans are evil? I\u2019m inHave you ever had a vegan talk at you?Herbivores are way more violent than carnivores. If I had to choose between walking thru a herd of well-fed hippos vs well-fed crocs if choose the crocs any dayboars are omnivores and their horns aren't ornamental, that's somethingLet's just exclude dinosaurs... like CarnotaurusLizardsHipo kill more people than crocs.... FactHorns are put on scary creatures because horns = evil.  Horns = evil because the devil has horns and the devil is evil personified.  The devil is the Christian version of a pagan god, a god that was not evil but just represented both men and death.  The Christians absorbed that myth but made him evil in order to vilify paganism, and 'the devil' was born.  However, when the pagans called the male god the horned god... they didn't mean head horns... they meant he had a dick.  So all those evil horns are inspired by the dick of the pagan god of men and death.Err, what are Puffins? \n\nYou get the 'Horned Variety' and they eat fish, insects etc. \n\nDoes this count?well horns are supposed to be intimidating dumbassGorillas, koalas, pandas are herbivores and don't have hornsSo, Devil is herbivore?whats stoping a herbivor from eating meatAnd they usually grow horns and snicker menacingly the second they think of something evil... like having a bite of lettuce.My grandpa who was a Farmer used to say that all his meanest cows and bulls had little to no horns and all his docile, friendly cows, ox, bulls had big horns. His theory was that it's nature's balancing act, by giving horns to docile creatures who can't defend themselves, it gives at least an appearance that the animal should not be messed with, while giving no or little horns to aggressive cows, nature makes sure the animal can't do much harm. My guess, it could be hormonal, agressive mammals vs non-aggressive but perhaps a zoologist or a vetrenarian could chime in.You can make one by genetically engineering a sperm of a carnevorous and canibalistic animal mix with a horned herbivore and radiate for an 6 hours and viola with in 9-12 month you will get a omnivoros canibalistic horror animal but if the egg cells don't die in the mother's womb that how they make a genetically engineered animal you can make a horror animal if the mom doesn't die. It is also how you make a Chernobyl looking mutant animal.I actually heard that the reason for that is we have carnivore features so we see them as more human. Hence us thinking cats and dogs are cut even though they can kill us. Whereas everything else is non-human and creepy/evil. The goat symbolizing Satan fir example. I thought it was a pretty cool take.I've been in area 51 it's full with biological weapons and mutant animals with defectsThat's what makes them scary.Imagine a cow with big-ass horns and razor sharp teeth chasing you to be their next mealNow I can't get the thought that the devil is a vegetarian out of my head.The depiction of the devil (horns and hoofed) strongly resembles Pan, Greek God of the wild, demonized by Christians as he is often affiliated with sex and Pagans. One path to associating \u201cevil\u201d and hornsI am just realizing I always assumed this was due to the early church demonizing pagan gods, some of which were horned, like Pan for just an example. Never really actually stopped to think about it or why I thought that though and have no idea if it's actually true at all.You're forgetting Carnataurs.According to Wikipedia, the only known. Carnivorous bipedal animal with horns was the Carnotauruscarnotaurus and ceratosaurus had never heard such bullshit beforeI disagree, I'm an omnivore and I'm horny afBacchus the half goat had horns.

There's a reason why the devil is often portrayed as a goat.Bucks are assholesAhem, insects, various critters in the ocean, incredibly long, diverse, largely lost and often Weird evolutionary history. AhemI mean, they know the horrors we havent even thought of!No wonder they removed Hellboy's horns. He's not evil.We use to tease our old milk cow.

However, if you piss off a moose, they don\u2019t give two shits, and will stomp you into the dirt anyways.\n\nIn this respect, a horned monster is scarier, since they won\u2019t stop upon realizing it is not worth its time to mess with you.

To summarize, at one time, the distance between the cow's horns, running at full speed towards me, and my body was less than three inches, with exactly no barrier between the two. Our of sheer survival instinct I unconsciously climbed a 6-foot brick wall in a fraction of a second, when it normally takes me a couple of seconds, and the same happened to my cousin a few feet away from me.\n\nI know I was in danger of dying because one person *did* almost die that day, and had to be driven to the hospital with multiple concussions, multiple broken ribs, a broken sternum, a large cut in the back of the head, and drifting in and out of consciousness, all because a particular cow charged at him *while he was behind a heavy steel door* (so imagine the goring scene if the cow did manage to catch me directly with its horns.)\n\nAnd that was after having worked with police dogs and having had accidents with them that made *me* go to the hospital. Nothing was even close to being as scary or stressful as that day.\n\nMany people who've worked with cattle have similar horror stories of people being in grave danger of severe injury or death, or even have been or have seen people be severely injured or killed. These animals weight close to a ton and have the temperament of a cranky three-year-old, armed with sharp horns that will turn you into a kebab and strong legs that will break your entire ribcage if they ever kick you square in the chest.I'mma try giving this horned Tarantula a carrot:\n\nhttps://www.theraphosidae.be/en/ceratogyrus-marshalli/Carnotaurus have horns and were distinctly not veggiesClimb in a pen with a bull and you'll see whyWhy can\u2019t vegetarians be evil or scary?

They're also metal afThe thought of a tiger skewering its prey with its horns is kinda funnyThe only thing that comes to my mind is the sacrificial goat in Judaism  \nBasically you load all of your sins onto that sacrificial goat and then send it into the desert. (Christians have their own sacrificial lamb they sent into the desert)\n\nAnyway it's not far fetched to believe that some imagine that sinful goat to come back and haunt the peopleCarnotaurus had little \"horns\".And there's no such thing as a scary herbivoreWhat bout sabertooth lion not Quite sure about the english nameWhat about carnotaurus?

Some pagan deities and beings also had goat like features. Like Baphomet and satyrs.Funny how God kill more people than Satan in the bible but is supposed to be the good guy, or how evil has horns but in nature most creatures with horns are peaceful...

Hedgehogs and porcupines have those to stop being eaten. And demons are very commonly depicted with goat features.\n\nSharp teeth and claws are features of predators that we do see on monsters. So I guess my asspull theory is that when we design monsters we tend to just mash up features we associate with \"danger\" and don't care much for whether they logically gel with each other.I think it is because goats have horns. They are often used in pagan imagery hense Satan/Lucifer got horns. Then when modern character designers wanted to make something look evil they based it on the most evil charchter, Satan himself.\n\nBut yeh if you base it on nature if you really wanted the most evil looking thing you could just use a plain old humanHerbivore does not mean not evil and not scary. Today there was a post of an old woman killed by a horny bull.Ah..swordfish?Beetles? :DHorns hurt when you try to touch foreheads with evil peopleUnicorns have horns and one ate my grandmaCarnivores kill unprovoked because they need to eat. If herbivores kill unprovoked they're evilSometimes, there is a good reason.

I've never met herbivore!I also think it is likely that more humans have been hurt by horned herbivores than have been hurt by predators. Since herbivores are what we domesticate and hunt most of the time we also have a lot more chances to be hurt by them.\n\nSo when farmer Bill is gored to death, farmwife Jill will be telling their son Gill about the horned deamon that took his farmer father.What\u2019s interesting is that elephants seem to understand death, so the use of lethal force on another animal isn\u2019t an accident.

I know these guys don't have horns or antlers but they are decidedly evil herbivores[deleted]Definitely should be the top comment.Pan, basically the satyr god of being nice to animals, became a figure of sexual self expression relatively recently around the 19th century and that's why Satan is often depicted as a goat-like horned god. There were others, but pan encouraging women and gays was just too far for the church.Thanks for the explanation, this comment should be higher up!So Christian representations of evil are somewhat of an amalgamation of features from old pagan gods?Came here for an explanation. Thank you.I actually thought it had something to do with goatsHmm this answer makes the most sense.. but correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but weren\u2019t \u201cevil\u201d horned creatures pretty prominent in mythology prior to Christianity? \n\nAnd weren\u2019t some of the horned pagan gods either outright evil or at the very least Chaotic Neutral? (More akin to forces of nature etc. / needing virgin sacrifices to be appeased etc. etc.)And to go even deeper, goats and sheep were the main animals that were sacrificed to the gods, so it's natural that the shrines and images associated with gods contained skelatal remains. With Christianity you no longer needed to make a sacrifice, so animal parts were frowned upon.Makes sense. Cernunnos is often depicted with antlers and goat hooves.Likewise the Bible also describes good folks as God's sheep and he's the Shephard. Whereas bad people are goats who are separated out, and notably have horns.Satan often has satyr like characteristics too like hoovesPlot twist; the devil is vegan.In fairness, the majority of animals aren\u2019t bipedal, eitherWhat about quadrapedal?There\u2019s a lot more than carnotaurus but the only horned non herbivores that come to mind are dinosaurs and insects that prey on insects, making them ofc, insectivorous.Not just right, but literally right! That\u2019s like, right but more!There's also CeratosaurusAnd I'm not sure where the source is but I remember recently watching a paleontology news video about how the horns weren't even really horns at all. Flesh went on them so they barely stuck outdilophosaurus and other dinosaurs had large keratin crests that may have served the function of horns.It's because horns are not a useful thing to have when you hunt. It's display for seducing, or a weapon to defend yourself (some antelopes are scary with theirs!) or fighting other guys with horns  \n(Not disagreeing with you, just adding further contexte for people reading down there)Chameleons and some snakes also have horns.Same applies for hooves I think.\n\nStrongly associated with the devil but only exist on herbivoresOr a bull or a water buffaloA goat is vicious enough.Deer are omnivores too right?[deleted]There has never been a carnivorous animal with any significant horns and for a good reason.  \nHorns are usually used to either make oneself look larger or as a weapon eitehr for self defense or other things. Turns out you don't need a hard to control horn as a weapon when you have claws and teeth that are way more effective.Thank you kind internet stranger!It's a showerthought with a very clear answer as to why- Catholic propaganda against Wiccans.Actually not, makes literally no sense.Aren't Narwhal horns actually teeth?Swimmin in the ocean\n\nCausin a commotion \n\nBecause they are so awesomeSwimming in the ocean....&#x1F42E;    \nWow, Mr McClure I was a grade A moron to ever question eating meat.His first act was telling a couple people that all the cool kids eat fruit.

Very informative.Honestly, it's still pretty weird that the most distinguishing feature of critters like cows and sheep is synonymous with powerSo, God was horny?Theologically speaking the cross represents the moment/place Jesus died and took with him the original sin. Thinking the cross represents the execution method is the definition of not thinking past the surface.Not really. Baphomet, as you and I understand it, is a relatively modern creation. Originally a corruption of the name Mohammad, the word was then used for a made-up pagan deity that the Templars were accused of worshiping as justification to arrest them. That bit of history eventually grabbed the attention of an occultist in the 19th century who created the goat-man image we think of today. \n\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Baphomet](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Baphomet)Like horned animals, despite being nearly exclusively herbivore, are also the most *violent*.\n\nA Crocodile will attack you for food and ignore you otherwise. A Rhino will attack you because *it saw you*.\n\nNot to mention in certain species only the males have horns (Sheep with Rams for example), which results in a correlation between being horned and being violent.\n\nSo people see animals that have horns are more violent that animals without, even of the same species, and have less reason for their violence than other animals and maybe at some point think \"hey maybe horns are a symbol of violence\".She was Karving her initials on the m\u00f8\u00f8se with the sharpened end of an interspace t\u00f8\u00f8thbrush given her by Svenge - her brother-in-law - an Oslo dentist and star of many Norwegian m\u00f8vies: \"The H\u00f8t Hands of an Oslo Dentist\", \"Fillings of Passion\", \"The Huge M\u00f8lars of Horst Nordfink\"...Because they've got big teeth and claus and don't need them.well goats *are* herbivorous**[Carnotaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus)** \n \n >Carnotaurus  is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Late Cretaceous period, probably sometime between 72 and 69. 9 million years ago.

You leave the horny goat god alone.your comment confuses and frightens me.Excuse me sir, I believe the proper term is moosen.Technically, those are antlers, not horns.  Antlers are shed every year, and are made of bone..  Horns are permanent, and are (partly) made of keratin, the same substance that makes up fingernails and hair.\n\nThe one exception is the pronghorn antelope, which has horns that shed.Looked it up cause that sounds wrong, and Google says they're herbivores, sooo... what the heck kind of psycho deer have you seen?...that's what op said in the post you are replying toIt\u2019s from being constantly horny.A boar? They don't have horns, they have tusks and they are the pigs teeth. Very different from horns.Well goats will eat just about anything including meat if you give it to themThis drastically needs way more upvotesOmnivorey impressed by thisIts a good theory. I just think horns looks bad ass and are easily recognisable as dangerousWell considering we\u2019ve killed vastly more of them than us, I\u2019m sure their stories they pass on are even more horrifying.Herbivores are natural pray so they don't hesitate to show dominance against anything that looks like can hurt or attack them, preditors know that they are on top of the food chain so they mostly don't care about species approaching unless it's about territory or they are hungry.Former farmer father*Humans understand death, and accidentally kill all the time.Could be that they feel superior and only elephant lives matter to them.I've never seen a human with a 4 chambered stomach that can digest cellulose either.Steroids are technically not meat so. Also even if he doesnt, most of them use  some sort of recovery aid, so they can workout sooner. At a certain point your muscles are limited by how many calories you can eat + how much rest you need and the time it takes to do both, vs how much time you have to lift.\n\nSo I totally believe the worlds strongest man is vegan. But he ain't drug free. 100%Umm an ox has 4 stomachs and spends 18 hours a day eating. This is a terrible analogy.Fun fact: even herbivores eat meat from time to time. Look up cow eating chicken on youtube. It will change how you see the worldAnd all the other strongest men aren\u2019t vegan. Makes you wonder if the vegan guy could be THE worlds strongest man if he introduced meat into his diet.I've also never seen an ox inject testosterone!One of how many? How many of the strongest men under him are as well?It's not mean, it's gangsta.  It's a scary world, and a vegetarian's gotta defend their place in it as much as any other, to the death, if necessary.No, they are teethThat's the onePrehistory was full of horned carnivores. In dinosaurs, this includes [Carnotaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus), [Ceratosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratosaurus), [Procerataurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceratosaurus), [Dracovenator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracovenator), [Cryolophosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryolophosaurus) and others. Many Pterosaurs had [prominent crests](https://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/on-exhibit-posts/flying-colors-pterosaurs-crests), some of which were very [horn-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteranodon).\n\nIt's true that the majority of *mammals* with horns are herbivorous. But even then, there are some exceptions. [Narwhals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narwhal) of course have a prominent \"horn\" (though this is actually a tooth) and eat fish and squid. Weirdly, Golden Jackals occasionally grow a [teeny tiny horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackal%27s_horn) at the back of their skulls.\n\nThe main use of horns is not defence, but rather sexual selection (they just look sexy to some species). The reason they appear more in herbivorous vs carnivorous mammals is more an accident of evolution than anything else.Disqualified on the grounds of being ornamentalSomething something Jacksoff chameleons are never hornyBefore getting a healthy dose of forced evolutionary virusI don\u2019t know if you knew or not but the deathclaws are supposed to be based off these guysDude I happily lived to the ripe old age of like 25 before I learned that the happy go lucky chunky hippo bois were straight up *murderers*\n\nThose guys are angry.They just kill you for the fun of it.

But yeah - there's no caloric need there.Mooses broAh yes hippo horns...Hitler was a vegetarian.Moose are fucking massiveDon't forget freaking Moose, terrifyingly big and aggressivemoose arent exactly the kindest mf\u2019s eitherMoose are scary too.

My rap skills may be weak, but I'm pretty sure I could win a rap battle against a buffalo.\n\nSuck it, herbivores!\n\nEdit: thanks for the award.Well in the west the traditional horns on mythical beings come from pagan myths of nature creatures. \n\nThe famous one of course is Dionysus and his satyrs. \n\nThen when the Catholic church began to consolidate its power in Europe those once revered creatures and gods were recoded as demons and monsters.You certainly don\u2019t want to tangle with horny animalsThe jackalopeWhen you aren't running down your food, you have extra energy to devote to keeping from becoming food.They\u2019re either too cute or too scary.Yes \ud83d\ude42 they don\u2019t have meat eaters teeth so they need some defensesTheir only real dangers are rhinos and elephants, rhinos are typically still scard but elephants just walk through hippo corwds bc they know hippos can't kill themI have heard this fact, but is it because Lions basically only exist in wildlife reserves these days?Mynd you, m\u00f8\u00f8se bites Kan be pretti nasti...Literally came here to say this too.

Nothing personal, your name just fits my dietary plan.\"Eeek :( why mr Goat?Vegetarian serial killers?Which if you think about it is the least evil reason to kill.I feel like evil monsters usually kill because.. Well, theyre evil and want to kill. Killing for food is a predator thing, not an evil monster thing.\n\nHorns are just frightening for their destructive potential - i imagine a lot of farmers through out history have had accidents and so the perception of horns as being evil have spread.Man.. you might not like it, but you got to admit their Marketing department was pretty impressive back in the day.If Jesus had come today\n\nHe could have reached a whole nation\n\nIsrael in 4 BC\n\nHad no mass communicationPan was also known for causing panic and having a massive shlong.But doesn't images of demons and Satan depicted with horns go back way further than the 19th century?  \n  \nWhat's the deal with goats and devils anyway.I would say some of them at least are.Pan, one of the major examples the original commenter is discussing, is depicted as having the legs, butt, and horns of a goat. Maybe that's what you're thinking of?I don't know if you are referring to any.specific god you heard of or in general.\n\nBut that's not the idea i got from what i read about it\n\nSince the Bronze Age, horns had become a sign of divinity, and so horned gods were fairly common.\n\nThey started mostly associated to gods of the hunt, and gradually some evolved to gods of nature and fertility etc. So not evil at all, and mostly good.\n\nFor example in mesopotamia Baal was the good horned god of life and fertility, in eternal battle agains the god of death and sterility (Mot).\n\nHowever, reading the bible you will find this name associated with evil and even as a synonim to Satan. This is because Baal was a rival god to the Jews, so old jewish texts depict him as evil. \n\n\nRemember that some stories that we learn about ancient religions were told by their enemies, so they can be innacurate\n\nAlso, please note that the current notion of good and evil is very different than the one people might have 3000 years ago. In the old testament, there are plenty of records of human sacrifice to god, or other acts that would be considered cruel or plain evil. However the chriatian god is considered good by christianityHitler vas vegetarian. \n\nSo the next step would be the Vegan DevilRob Zombie is vegan.Pretty sure there aren\u2019t any.Also it's kinda beside the point but most herbivores are opportunistic omnivores. If they can add some extra protein into their diet without expending too much effort or getting sick, they they'll usually do it.We have a saying in Ireland that the front end of a bull is one of the three scariest things in the world.At least they're opportunists.  Go to youtube and search \"Deer eats...\" and just watch what comes up.Unicorn. so easyI'm sure we had one in Australia. Just seems wrong if we didn't.A TIL in a shower thought - here\u2019s my coin too.[the narwhal\u2019s tusk is actually an\u00a0overgrown spiralized tooth\u00a0and it\u2019s one of only two teeth they\u2019ll ever possess](https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2019/03/08/exactly-narwhal-tusk/)\n\nInteresting!So the devil was just trying to get us to reduce our carbon footprint and christianity vilified him for it? I'm now picturing god wearing a MEGA (make eden great again) hat when he kicked Adam and Eve out.Not if you are part of a herding society, where wealth is measured in part by the heads of cattle/sheep/goats you own.A bull is a creature of incredible power that was familiar to everyone in the ancient world. The legend of Gilgamesh featured a giant super powerful bull that the hero has to fight, for example.Well there are also rinos, extinct dinosaurs, and horned fish that can be quite aggressive. We are living in an age where many of the animals referenced in ancient texts are long since extinct, so meanings and figures of speech may be very different from what we interpret them as.How many times is the cross mentioned in the Bible versus the terms grace, sacrifice, or redemption? The focus is the sacrifice not the mode of death. In fact, the focus is supposed to be the resurrection as opposed to the death. Early Christianity found the cross repulsive.Aren\u2019t those fuckers ominivorous?They are well known for eating meat. There is some argument in the scinetific community that they should be reclassified as omnivourous because of their extensive meat and bone eating.\n\nhttps://www.outdoorhub.com/stories/2013/09/09/the-meat-eating-habits-of-deer/Deer, elk, probably many of the Cervidae are well known to eat rodents of all sorts.  Caribou reindeer - there are reports of them eating human and beer remains also.\n\nMy question is, do MOOSE eat???I think I know what Mr. Morty is talking about. Deer are most definitely herbivores, but will resort to eating smaller animals like rabbits every once in a while.Classic. Hey have a good one, sirBut that is my point. \n\nOne theories for why the fear of snakes is so prevalant is that when we where monkies living in trees snakes where the big bad. This is why humans pattern recognition is very good at spotting \"snake shapes\" and spotting this sends a strong fear reaction to our brain. [(Snake Detection Theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_detection_theory)\n\nSo something being detectable as dangerous is bound to inspire fear and if more people die from cows than tigers, then it makes sense to attribute horns a scary feature in stories.Generally, impaling someone isn't accidentalDamn, where have I heard this one before?I've also seen a video of a horse eating a chick, at least I think it did.so you're saying this is where \"horny\" comes from?What if it's based on likelihood to be prey. AFAIK, many apex predators today don't partake in cannibalism as often as they eat primary foods, but I could see dinosaurs of most eras always having a bigger fish, so to speakClearly demons are dinosaurs.The qualification given .. was horns. Overruled, and I would advise you not to try that again.Isnt an insectivore not even classified as a carnivore?We took all their marbles and they are hungry.A close friend of my family is a teacher, and he told us the story of them going to the zoo with the students (teenagers). Some guy climbed over the hippo fence to touch the calf when the teachers weren't looking, because teenagers be dumb as fuck.\n\nThe mother hippo got protective of her calf (well d'uh), pushed him against a wall, and squished. He died, class was utterly traumatized, rules for school visits to zoos were changed, the whole shitstorm. Just because one fucking idiot thought it a smart idea to climb into an enclosure with an angry two-ton animal.You ever seen one of those guys take a dump? They wiggle their wee tails furiously and it kinda chops up the jobby and then there's chunks of shite flying around everywhere.Fuck hippos. \n\nThey drown impala that get stuck in dam mud.\n\nThey eat each other's children.\n\nThey mark their territory by fanning around poop with their tails like a propeller.\n\nThey kill more people than any other animal except the mosquito (malaria)\n\nThey have a max speed of 45km/h, which is faster than  our top athletes doing the 100 m dash.\n\nThey can't swim. They just drift to the bottom and walk around.\n\nFuck em.Fantasia was a lie.The Egyptian God of Destruction, Set/Seth, is often depicted as a hippo for a reasonDid you know there is a feral population of hippos in the jungles of Colombia released from escobars estate?You kill for substance, I kill for fun, we are not the same - Herbivores, probablyThey don't kill for the fun of it. They kill because not killing a predator when they see it means the predator could kill them later.Hippos aren't terrified they just hate everythingIIRC, it\u2019s aggression more than fear. Like a number of animals, they\u2019re most dangerous when they\u2019re in heat because they get really angry and territorial.Yeah am I missing something here? Lot of people talking about hippos in an \u201canimals with horns\u201d thread for some reason.*AND* elephant horns.  another mysteryActually, he was not. Hitler liked to portray himself as vegetarian [but he still occasionally ate meat](https://slate.com/human-interest/2004/02/was-hitler-a-vegetarian.html)Stalin tooLions and leopards are the other 2. The idea of the Big 5 was that they were the most dangerous to hunt, back in the\u201dglory days\u201d of big game trophy hunting. I guess hippos weren\u2019t as dangerous to hunt. They\u2019re bloody dangerous animals, but so are many others. \nI spent some time living in a game reserve in South Africa and the animals I was warned about the most were the Buffalo. They have very poor vision and the solitary males will gore and trample you to death if they\u2019re startled. Most of the predators have the common sense to stay away from people, most of the time. But herbivores can be pretty aggressive.You've clearly never met the rhymnocerous, or the hip-hopopotamus.Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.Big talk til the Yakkity Yak rolls up and spits straight fireThis human thinks it's a challenge that he brings\n\nOnly buffalo you defeating is slathered on wild wings\n\nOf that I have no doubt.\n\nYou think cuz I'm a herbivore I can't chew you up and spit you out? \n\nDon't even need a fork.\n\nYou think I'm just a city in new york?\n\nNope. I'm lennox lewis to your mike tyson\n\nBet that's the last time you talk shit to a bison.&#x200B;\n\nSatyrs seemed like your standard partying dudebros.They will fuck you upDont think there's any being on earth that adult elephants need to be scared of, humans asideLions are not *that* under populated. Lions, like most felines, choose their targets carefully. Usually they determine the amount of effort involved in taking down a target vs the amount of food they will get for it.  If they don't, and they spend too much energy, they may not be able to chase down their next kill and they will starve.\n\nTo hippos, territory is food. If anything seems like it could threaten their territory, they will attack it. They are not as worried about energy investment because if their territory is secure, their supply is also.No cuz hippos are fucking dangerous and lions do not want to fuck with them.I tried telling the judge that and got charged with 1st degree homicide.Probably third least, next to self defense and accidental.Killing to eat... \n\nHmm[deleted]I mean look at them now. Nobody can touch Jesus merch. You slap a cross or a white baby on a shirt and bam, those things are selling like hot cakes.[deleted]Yeah there's always been some amount of goat in demonic monsters. Sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell is a common biblical theme and also a good song.     \n      \nSatan himself used to be depicted more as a human because he is supposed to be the Henry Cavill of angels or something like that.Fyi Hitler preached vegetarism but ate many meat meals and products. The same way he preached blond and blue eyes people or athletic or sane bodies when really he had brown hairs and eyes, was unathletic and full of drugs.\n\nThose type of people would tell you anything that fits their agenda but most of the time it's either bullshit or ironically opposite to the reality.Not with that attitudeSiberian zombie goats. Check and mateThere are numerous horned reptiles that display carnivory, in fact there is an entire genus that fits this bill: Phrynosoma, the horned lizards.Various species of lizards have horns and are predators.Alright. Look here, you fuck. You can't just leave us hanging like that. What's the other two? The rear end? Being in the same room as a Catholic priest?[Rare video of one in nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBQQ_-VuvGU)They're not extinct though.

As part of it they had two narwhal tusks; not one - two!Not to mention, the absurd strength of a bull, or hell... even a ram.  \n\n\nIn a pre-industrial world, animals were where the power was.  There's a reason my  man Watt named it \"horsepower\".What horned fish are aggressiveHerbivores.  They have their reputation of eating everything because they are browsers instead of grazers.  Meaning that they will eat your trees and shrubs before they try your lawn.  That and they are curious and will play with lots of inedible objects.  No hands so the pick them up with their mouths.  \n\nI own goats.Yes, moose eat.What sort of beer remains? Cans or bottles? Or is their diet mainly thrown-away koozies?I wonder if dinosaur bones also put the fear of horns in people.  If some guy walks into the castle with a horn the size of an arm and a skull from a beast unknown.  Stories manufacture themselves.I\u2019ve been wondering whether part of the fear/disgust of snakes people have is partially cause by the prevalence of religion. I\u2019m mostly only familiar with Christianity/Catholicism with the serpent. But it never made sense to me that people would be ok with other reptiles but terrified of snakes other than that differentiation. \nI guess there weren\u2019t Komodo dragons in the trees threatening the monkeys either though.generallyYeah saw that tooIndeed it does. \"Horny\" comes from the word horn, which has always been a phallic symbol, and used to be exclusive to men. There's an old idiom, the put the horns on someome, which means to be unfaithful. All generally connected.More like animals recognized the human male penis growth as a neat thing, correlated the rigidity with sex, and incorporated that into the plan for their next evolutionary step.Shit I already have two strikes they will throw me out of the councilObjection! While the defendant's first reason wasn't the best, I would also like to point out that the horns are on the face like a rhino. If we are talking about evil people with horns, it is always on both sides of the head like bovine. Therefore the qualification should be evil horns on both sides of the head unless an example of other evil horns can be given.Tagline for a Hungry Hungry Hippos horror movie?Oh, what?

He didn't fall into the enclosure, he climbed over a massive fence.A wee jobby may sound cute, but it isn\u2019t.that moment you realise you wronged your fish by naming it steve jobbie:Yes, it's to show Ngu (I think) that there's no fish bones in their poop.It's terrifying, but also the way it flaps its ears as it surfaces is adorable.Even if you limit it to non-human mammals, dogs kill many more than hippos. The statement is just completely wrong.\n\n[Hippos estimated to kill about 500 per year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deadliest_animals_to_humans)That's right, Seth was that weird thing with the nose right? MybYeah right, no one even gonna talk about how ornery sheep get with horns.Well TIL hippos are actually just herbivores.This completely turned into a hippo post.and there are plenty of people who murder/ have affairs etc who are still identifying as christians or whatever afterTIL I'm a vegetarian. Well, off to the butcher.They call me the Hiphopopotamus\r  \nFlows that glow like phosphorous\r  \nPopping off the top of this esophagus\r  \nRocking this metropolis\r  \nI'm not a large water-dwelling mammal\r  \nWhere did you get that preposterous hypothesis\r  \nDid Steve tell you that perchance?\r  \nSteveMy rhymes are so potent\n\nThat in this small segment \n\nI made all of the ladies in the area pregnant.Bisonnnnn\"I am not a rapper\"And it usually fails miserablyGood pointCan someone tell that to the F&F franchise. Please, just stop.I heard he pours his cereal *milk first*He sounds like a REAL JERK!So I just looked a bit into it because I've heard that too. I don't know if it was considered as morally important at the time by the people or the leaders, but the Third Reich did pass some laws about protecting domestic and non-domestic animals, especially against abuses and cruelty.\n\nBut how convenient that is, since the way of producing k\u00f6sher meat is claimed to be \"barbaric\" by Nazis... seem to be more than a coincidence to me. But you know, it could be a way of \"healing\" two birds with one stone.\n\nEdit: on Wikipedia we can read that apparently it was mostly propaganda, as we couldve expected. All domestic animals that belonged to jews were deported and executed, and no law ever forbid hunting, fishing or eating meat. On the contrary, several scientific experiences or sportive hunt (for the pleasure of hunting, not eating) were conducted by Nazi leaders.\n\nIt seems once again that leaders, as always, and especially the bad ones, love to do the opposite of what they claim.\nThe so-called purity that the Third Reich tried to tell in its propaganda was only words to win the moral war against the enemies propaganda.You create english?Is it irrational to be afraid of snakes, tho? To have a *phobia*, yeah probably. That's be more to do with mental health.\n\nI'm instinctively scared/cautious of all things that I know can harm me.Being scared of snakes is irrational? Or am I missing your point?This is /r/changemyviewThat sounds like karmacourt with extra stepsThat. . . Actually sounds really fun.This time, it's for all the marbles.Something something lost their marblesOoh, ah, that's how it always starts, but then later there's running and screaming.A lot of people don't realize this, and it makes local political discussions very difficult to have in most parts of the US without resulting in high intensity arguments/disagreements over how \"things should change\".To be fair, fish often have a long string of jobby hanging out their butts most of the day.[deleted]Which is interesting if you think about it. In the US, at least, the average person sees a dog at least once a week probably. I'm sure the numbers in other parts of the world are pretty high too. How often do people in Africa run into hippos? It can't be all that often. I'd bet the deaths per encounter is up there with the best of them.A type of dog yeh ( unknown what exact animal he is supposed to be)And I\u2019m here for itI hate you and hope you die! Praise Jesus!My rhymes are so potent that in this small segment, I've made all of the ladies in the area pregnant\n\nYes, sometimes my lyrics *are* sexist, but you lovely bitches and hoes should know I'm trying to correct this!Taking that show off of free prime video is on the \"ways Jeff Bezos has personally wronged me\" list.My name is clarence and that's no lie\nIf you don't believe me just ask momYes, my rhymes, \nare sometimes \n\na bit sexist\nBut you lovely\n\nBitches and hoes\nShould know I\u2019m trying \n\nto correct this[removed]Can't be, after all that would be the best thing he'd ever done.What a monster!! \ud83d\ude31\"You don't create a fear of horns from that.

Entropy is.Black holes still don't survive time, they still have a weakness.Time is really at the top of the food chainNot my proudest fap.Time itself is the at the topI had a black girlfriend and I can guarantee you all her holes got ate.No, I\u2019m at the top of the food chain. I\u2019d like to see a black hole bench 150Pfff, black holes... wait until you hear about\n\n# *E N T R O P Y*Because nobody eats them. Subtle racism at its finest.They don't eat meat, black holes are herbivores.... So far.They don't eat, they only consume[deleted]I have a theory that black holes are separate universes, hear me out here aight? The universe is suspected to have been started with a Big Bang, much like the super nova of a star turning into a black hole, and then the black hole sucks in infinite amounts of energy from light and start dust which means it can expand infinitely. Which would mean it would be impossible to leave universe because there would be an infinite force pulling you back.(if you could reach the edge that is)Time eats black holes.Time says hi.Black holes are the top predators, but entropy has more patienceProof you dont need a brain to be on top.i think about this all the time, everything is trying to grow and evolve, not just what we consider \u201clife.\u201d planets, thoughts, ai, everything is trying to grow. hard to explainIf gravity pulls things down doesn\u2019t that make it the bottom[removed]What if something is bigger than a black hole? Like what if, rhetorically, we could say combining universes are technically setting each other.~~Entropy would like a word with you~~\n\nu/SinisterLemons beat me to it.Vacuum decay bubble is top of food chain.Bigger blacker holesThere's always bigger fishWe are krill for the blackhole whaleBlack holes are not alive and therefore don't eat.Yo momma so fat she eats black holes for breakfast.u/david_ismpdBlack holes can suck my dick. I\u2019m gonna eat a black hole just to prove humanity is better.Time is the biggest killerTheres always a bigger fishIts entirely possible we are a 2 dimensional brine on the event horizon of a 4th dimensional black hole.\n\nWe're the top of the food chain.Not giving a fuck is at the top of the food chain. What can beat that?*Entropy cracks a wide, knowing grin*And brown holes are at the bottomWe all know the Gongoozler is really at the topApex predatorThere is a method in witch humans could, in the far future, extract energy from a black hole by shooting electrons very close to it, letting them gain energy, and then catching them. That way we would slowly consume the black hole making us nr 1 again. \nSource : https://youtu.be/ulCdoCfw-bY\n\nPs: i have watched that video a long time ago so i might be wrong about details. Pleas watch it if you are intrested.This is some Cthulhu-level stuff. A predator and force so large and powerful that we practically don't perceive it, nor it us. To a black hole, we're simply germs.\n\nOr even worse, _maybe it's just hand sanitiser_.I am not in the shower or high enough to understand thisHahahWhy the fuck is this on allThe real question is, does a good CHAIN really have a top?They seem more like a power bottomHawking Radiation destroys black holes.  Entropy is king.New rule every shower thought has to be peer-reviewed seven times before being posted.I would say entropy's better at this.If they were alive yesThis is kind of stupid*laughs in Hawking radiation*As far as we know.r/lostredditors, this belongs on r/retardedthoughts since I just ate seven black holes.Earth is at the top of our chain it consumes allCan't exactly be shit without light, right?This is one of the best thoughts so farTime eats black holes.Time is at the top of the food chainHawking radiationsupermassive black holes are at the top.Laughs in entropy No bro, your mind is!Entropy would like to know you location.Isn't gravity above black holes since they're capable of slowly destroying black holes?I like to think that black holes are the butt holes of the universe and whatever gets sucked in are pooped into another dimension of the universeTrue. But also, the universe is actually at the top of the food chain since it has to hold every single black hole known and unknown. Edit: Why did this get downvoted lmaoThe idea of a black hole being thee apex predator is terrifying.No. Quark soup is.No wonder my ex girlfriend got fat.Hawking Radiation has entered the chatApex predators. \n\nBut don't great white sharks sometimes eat other great whites?There's always a bigger fishThe Astral Dreadnought would like a word...Time:So far...Black holes are always hungry.Can black holes eat smaller black holes?Someday, science will allow us to swallow the unswallowable.I'd prefer it that way, but it's not like I can change anything about it, so...That we know of...Idk, how many sharks have been eaten by black holes?Wow niceSomething that amuses me is, the smaller a black hole, the bigger.Nah, hawking radiation/entropy is :D energy eats energy ;)Black holes are anomaly to universesimulator.exeThere\u2019s always a bigger fishNo, there has gotta be something higher. Something is out there that eats blackholes.IndeedYou clearly haven\u2019t seen me at chilisYour moms the top of the food chain. She eats everything.Entropy is.Entropy: I'm about to end this Universes whole careerBut what about the White Hole?*furiously masturbates from the top of his underwearBut damn do they prefer spaghetti.  It's literally the only thing they eat...Proton decay?There's always a bigger black hole.maybeName checks out?What about white holes?Black holes arnt livingBlack holes are organisms now?global silence would do the trickWell, actually, it\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II, then black holes.Right below Time.As far as we know\\[Entropy has entered the chat\\]Time is still the apex predatorNah dude, I\u2019ve eaten your moms ass.But without them, we probably wouldn't have a galaxy.In that case so is the sunNo, even black holes will dissipate their energy/mass via Hawking radiation. Entropy, as always, is at the top of the food chain.Nah dude, entropy beats black holes. It just takes a whileThat we know ofSo is it about eating ass orI'm at the top of the food mobiusEntropy is top dog in this universe. As far as we know.\n\nEven black holes obey it. In fact, they are the highest entropy objects in the universe.\n\nThermodynamics, it's the LAW...entropy?Nope thats heat deathEntropy is the top of the food chain, black holes evaporate...Gravity is. \n\nWhen the force from the Bang loses momentum, collapse-ville it is.Wouldn\u2019t the universe be at the top since all that\u2019s known be in it?Nah. Entropy is.There's always a bigger hole.Time is.It\u2019s actually Hawking radiation tbhTime is at the top of the food chain, because even black holes will one day dissapear.I dunno man Kirby seems pretty high up thereAnd climate change should be pretty high up there, tooUnless they're not. Unless there is something that is a bigger threat. That is more terrifying and destructive.Brown holes are the end of the food chain.They are above the top, because they also eat smaller black holesWhat about entropy?Black holes are actually suns. I\u2019ve been saying it for years. And they\u2019re just finally realizing itThis is a proper shower thoughtBad shower thought is bad. because Blackholes aren't organic, aren't life, and literally can't exist in the concept of a food chain...The one thing that feeds on time itselfUntil we discover that dark matter eats black holesWhat about the big rip?In this analogy, what would two non black hole masses merging to form a black hole be? It's parents or its prey?I like to think that when enough black holes merge it goes snap and rebirth the universe. We're just in the middle of a cycle of nothing and everything. The multiverse is just one big snap over and over.I raise you ginormous butt plugEverything a black hole eats is at the top of the food chain, it gets tossed somewhere else in the universe but is what takes energy away from the black hole, gradually killing it and producing hawkins radiation. Someone said that time is what kills it, but conservation of mass/energy/momentum and all that shit means you need a force to act on the black hole, that force being its dinner. Time isn't a forceSure they are.. in this dimension anyway..My black hole is certainly at the very bottom. Everything eating that abomination.Maybe for youSurely Entropy still consumes Black Holes.Black holes are so vast and incomprehensible that one eating our sun would be the equivalent of gut flora living inside a prey animal being eatenAnd at the very bottom of the gravity well.Time is the top of the food chain. Because eventually our universe will turn into a dark void without even any black holes. Everything gone. Empty like my bank account.... that we know of.Now...   I feel small.Time and Space above BlackHole, as they two are the major factors for formation of a black hole, if either one dies the BL will consume itself.the black hole is the interest to a new universe.There's always a bigger black hole.... that we know ofFor nowdata consumption devices on an interdimensional level.What if something bigger exists... Like a white fillerWell until we got kardashev scale 2 or 3?  But i guess we wont even fully hit type 1I reject this unless there\u2019s evidence that black holes are sentient or a \u2018being\u2019 of some type.I feel like an astrophysicist would retort with \"Black holes are the END of the food chain.\"I fucking LOVE black holes. I love entropy.\n\nWhile I prefer to live my life by ideas, and not beliefs (basically, I don't mind changes to the status quo), I also love PATTERNS.\n\nAnd I love that even the universe, as insanely vast as it is, can't escape the cycle of death and rebirth a lowly fly on shit has. The only thing the universe gets is more time...but that time WILL eventually run out.\n\nIt's yet further proof that nothing is eternal. Not even our reality.\n\nThe only thing left is to figure out how our universe will spawn another. This universe will die, but not before it creates another as does ALL life.\n\nBecause if it doesn't, it will break the pattern. And I don't like the thought of that.As far as we know black holes have never eaten any animals, so they aren't predators.Brown holes on the bottomThat we know of...Nope. Heat death.Just don't fuck with the bellyFor now.Hawking Radiation: \"You dare oppose me mortal\"There\u2019s always a bigger black holeThere is no top to the food chain.Idk alligators are pretty scarynot shit sherlockAs far as we knowIMO time is the top.

Never said anything. Felt it was to dark.as far as we know. always a bigger fish.I'm pretty sure the only purpose of a black hole is to just delete things from the universe.Time isThe top of the food chain would be TimeIn this dimension they are mwhahagaCheck out solar 2Actually, Time is at the top of the food chain. Even black holes die.Time is the ultimate predator. All will fade into entropy, even black holes.No, entropy isWhat about the big crunch ?There's always a bigger fish.Black holes are just what the shielding systems of our much further advanced extraterrestrial friends in the universe look like.The bottom and the top.No! I am! Watch me eat all them black holes in spaceI think the dev is the top of the food chain.Black holes could eat anything, but they only eat spaghettiTaxes is a top the food chain. Well after Chuck Norris. Maybe black holes can be third.They\u2019re just waiting us out, we think we\u2019re hot shit for now but 10 trillion years from now black holes will all have the last laughEntropy isSupermassive black holes are higher.Watch them discover black poles in spaceYo I read that a theory that all the dark matter surrounding galaxies are actually primordial black holes just lurking about.  Terrifying.Entropy kills everything even black holesThere's ALWAYS a bigger fish.Supermassive black holes are topsWhat about Doug. I saw him put a whole hot dog in his mouth!No, we aren't, I promise you. There is always a bigger fish.That's like putting natural disasters in the food chain. We aren't food for hurricanes.forward movement of time towards entropy is alpha dogEntropy is at the top of the food chain.Is the sun at the bottom?As far as you know.There was an old lady who swollowed a fly...Nutron Stars are the black hole\u2019s opposites. They pump out enough light to vaporize anything with a touchAnd at the bottom, tooAll holes matter!!No, Hawking radiation isPff have you not seen Sharknado 9: Space Ocean?They aren't biological. Shower thoughts are weird realizations, not straight up stupidity.Entropy wants a wordHeat death: Am I a joke to you?makes sense, chewing up matter is badass \n\n*not a physicist, prolly not how it works*Entropy is clearly at the top of the food chain.  Even super massive black holes will eventually fall to entropy.Then what about anti-matter?Stars are now foodWell even after all the black holes die there will still be particles... so... particles are at the top of the food chain.As far as man kind knowTechnically the universe's expansion is but okEntropy is at the top of the food chain...I always thought black holes were just irl agar.ioIf your within 3 million light years of a black hole u start getting sucked in and attracted to it...that\u2019s mad respect, black holes got gameRelevant topic for something that came up just the other week in science, I Don't recall if it was theory or if they found a case where it occurred but basically it was what happened when a black hole meets a wormhole and it boiled down to the wormhole being a predator of the black hole so to speak.This one hurt my head for a whileReality itself is playing a game. Black holes are but a roleSo if I eat a black hole then I'm number 1?Even blackholes die by hawking radiationNo time is at the top of the food chainActually, your mom is at the top of the food chain.2ouldnt it be entropy or Hawking radiation?Pink holes are at the bottom of the food chain.Well, from a \"physical\" standpoint, they are actually the the bottom, the deepest all devouring bottom there is in the universe...Mind blowing. Seriously, thanks.The universe is at the top of the food chainIf black holes are on top, why do things fall into them? huh?

You mean yo mommasNo, entropy is.Big bang/crunch wants to know your location.Really they\u2019re just giant anteater mouths.No I am. I'm simply just built different.Actually, entropy is lurking in the shadows, waiting to devour black holes.Can black hole devour another black hole?You forgot the fountain in \u201escissors stone paper\u201cThey are the topI think there's a marvel comic villain that eats black holes. I just think so, though, I'm not fully sure.I cant say youre wrong, but i dont like what you just did. Take my upvote and please stopI like the idea of the Greek god Chaos. Beyond the religious aspect, it symbolises the origin, the creator that is beyond even the Olympus' reach. I think that's a good metaphor right now. There's always a bigger fish and we probably ignore it all.Time is at the top of the food chain. Even black holes get eaten away by it.Entropy is overlord.HopefullyGod is silly!WRONG! Black bears are! Beets, battle star galactica!There are always bigger black holes :)Yeah until they lose anything to eat due to rapid expansionNo. Time is the top of the food chain. Black hole will die out after some time. Although a very long time. Still, it will die out.Waiting for the innuendo commentsEntropy of the universe wants to know your locationBig bangs eat everything.TIL piper perri\u2019s butthole is the top of the food chainWho\u2019s top chicken? *black holes are top chicken*You've never had a pregnant wife.Pardoxities everywhereJust watch us use them to power our smartphones in the next 20 yearsThey are also the ultimate vorer/technicallythetruth ?and assholes at the bottomI\u2019d argue that big bangs or big Crunch is on top of the foodchainThe food chain only consists of living things? \nWhatever. I'll just take my hypercritical ass out.We think they are...but we don\u2019t really know what else is out there..Black holes are not vacuums.Conversely, brown holes are at the end of the food chain.black hole goes nom nomnope.... heat death is.Came for the title,stayed for the comments \ud83d\ude2fAnd information they spew out is the shit the universe is made with (see latest developments on the subject, it\u2019s insane)I didn't really need to know your porn preference.Me, thinking about how long the S11 Blaseball postseason was because of black holes: Yeah they sure areTime beats black holeAss holes are the bottom of the food chain.maybe there's something that consumes black holes.\ud83e\udd14Not if you're a super hot QuasarBlack ass holesWholesome rewards look big laugjAre the tho? \ud83d\ude09Hmmm....\ud83e\udd14.....White Holes, they've eaten so much they're throwing up excess.Motherfucker, you just warped my mindWait, isnt energy? Eventually, they will wither so doesnt the energy kill them? I don't know I'm not a scientist. I just thought \"everything loses energy at some point. Don't black holes?\"This is golden. Or black, I should say.Other .. bigger black holes?There's always a bigger *black hole*Entropy is very real my friend, the true, final apex predatorWell, technically the whole universe is a black hole's greatest predator. When the expansion of the universe becomes too much, back holes will be the only things left, and even they will dissipate until there is absolute nothingness. Death is the ultimate predator.Entropy.Pazuzu?r/AmITheBlackHolemaybe a universe?Gay guys are at the top of the dating food chain.Entropy consumes all.Dark energy is playing the long game.That's just excrementDoes the radiation consume the black hole, or is it a product of the black holes decay? I thought is was the latter.That's kind of like saying \"polar bears aren't apex predators because they can die of old age\".Hawking Radiation is running away from the black hole, not swallowing it.There is a yo mama joke there somewhere bigger than the black hole.Yo mama so fat her vagina collapsed the fabric of spacetime around her into a singularity, forming the black hole of dicksBlackholes aren't actually a hole fyi.Entropy.  That quiet nerdy guy at the party, nibbling away alone at all the snacks on the table until, before you know it, they're all gone, and nobody seems to know who the hell invited that nerdy guy to the party in the first place.False. It's Black bears.Fuck, im too slow...[deleted][deleted]That's like saying hunger is at the top of the food chainQueen Elizabeth: *I don't have such weaknesses!*ELI5 what happens to them?At the end of the universe, time loses all meaning. Entropy is the real end boss. Loads of cool videos about it on YouTube :e. G. https://youtu.be/uD4izuDMUQATime.doesnt really exist. Its a man made idea.Ah yes black holes fetishI'd be proud of that fap tbh. Imagine nutting into a black hole?Dude... xDMy man.[deleted]How does heat death interact with black holes? Doesnt heat death mean all things Just stop moving?Damn racist gravity.*citation neededOne hell of a shower thought.I bet it wasn't but now that I read your comment I decided it is.Now prove it with math.Dunno about this one. First off, it means that the black hole will constantly Lose energy too but we don't really observe any energy being drawn out from our universe (energy is always conserved). Secondly, a black hole can't really just suck in infinite amount of energy and matter. Thirdly, there should be some place in the universe which attracts all other areas (as the gravity gets stronger at the singularity and all matter is attracted towards it) but it isn't so. Fourth, let's just say that the black hole is expanding infinitly. Our universe doesn't expand evenly whereas I think a blackhole would expand evenly in all directions. Also, I think we would observe massive time distortions and space distortions too in different areas of the universe. The geometrical space distortion would be MASSIVE. No matter where we try to go, we would move towards the singularity.\n\nIf this theory is right though, then the big crunch end of the universe would probably be true. It's when the gravity gets stronger than the expanding force (dark matter) of the universe and the universe collapses on itself. The blackhole will just evaporate someday and so will our universe.\n\nBut whatever I said may all be wrong and we could be living in a blackhole.Black holes do not suck in infinite amounts of energy; it is finite.Black Holes don't actually suck things like a vacuum, iirc from an assignment I did like a week ago. But apart from that and other misconceptions what you're saying is pretty much the holographic principle (I think).And then long after all the black holes are consumed, even time dies.Well who knows, maybe some form of life evolved in stars, and that life found a way to survive in a black hole when their star diedWho defines what an organism is? You gonna walk up to a black hole and tell him that he ain\u2019t an organism? To his face?Shut the fuck upWow waka zwarte gaten eten!Just because it holds it doesn't mean it eats it.Multiverse has my vote.Eyo I love black holes :o*Yeah until they lose*\n\n*Anything to eat due to*\n\n*Rapid expansion*\n\n\\- throwaway12222018\n\n---\n\n^(I detect haikus.

The black hole release hawking radiation, which takes energy/mass away from the black hole, causing it to shrink.Well the radiation is caused by energy released from the black hole. But the energy is sort of \u201cstolen\u201d by one half of a virtual particle pair. So virtual particles eat the black hole eventually.https://imgur.com/a/Iwt5OL4Yo mom isIt was Gary, you know, that one guy that forces people to do things they don\u2019t want to?Yeah except the nerdy guy eats one atom at a time every century or so. APEX PREDATORfact. bears eat beets.Holy shit! That bear just killed a star!don't be too slow, or a black hole is gonna get youToo slow I am. Fuck!Very, very oversimplified explanation:\n\n1. In empty space, particles appear and disappear constantly at random. These are called virtual particles.\n\n2. These particles appear in pairs, and are of opposite charge. Under normal circumstances, they will interact with each other and annihilate one another instantly.\n\n3. If one of these pairs appears on the edge of the black hole, one of the virtual particles may fall into the event horizon while it's partner escapes and is not annihilated. This particle then \"becomes real\" and is no longer a virtual particle.\n\n4. This process must take energy from the black hole since a new particle had been created, thus causing the black hole to shrink slightly.Entropy is the fact that the black hole will dissolve into nothingnessEntropy is just everything in the universe moving in the direction of uniform temperature. \n\nIf all locations contain the same amount of energy, you can't do any work.\n\nIf you can't do any work, you can't \"do\" anything. There's no reactions or potential for reactions.\n\nHere's a very solid video on why entropy is, well, a thing, from Brian Greene: https://youtu.be/x4iU76Qj2mULose mass over time due to them releasing hawking radiation, eventually disappearing explosively.It does exist it works together with space and gravity to give you your reality.Did you everyone just forget about NNN or is it just not a thing this year?Exactly! r/blackholechan r/BlackholeChanCosplaysIt really sucks ;)Nom nom nomIt's not a joke. I am the alpha predatorI dont remember the exact explanation but i do remember [that this video does tell you what happens](https://youtu.be/uD4izuDMUQA)The gravity of racism is truly powerful. Listen to Paul Mooney.Do you know of any life on any other planet yet? Is light, matter, particles, quarks, leptons, etc, etc meat? So one can conlude that they are until one black hole reaches earth.Nah1+1=2 that statement is truey = mx+b \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthat's a start right*does competent science*, *finishes with idk man could be wrong*\n\nLike cmon my dude have some confidence that was some big brain shit I didn\u2019t think of, but black holes do alter the speed of time so I\u2019m theory we could still be in the expansion part of the black holes creation before it goes CRumpleElectromagnetic Life that thrives in a Black Hole\u2019s Accretion Disk?\n\nSounds truly exoticYou don\u2019t deserve the downvotesAh shit. You got me.I agree, chasing anus will be the death of me.I'm so sad we only have a week left before it's all gone.Momento Mori, dead by daylight\u201cI lived, one year\u201d\n\nMAAAAARKWait genuine question do black holes actually break down?We don\u2019t have long left friend. The end is near, and we must rebel against the inevitable. It will come, but if we don\u2019t try we will live wondering if we could have done something. So do something. Before you regret it.\n\n#PUSHRESET\n\nMemento Mori,\nUnus Annus\n\n(P.S. this is just a bit if it wasn\u2019t clear)> The ticking of the clock\n\nAnd even this dies, for when the last particle evaporates there will no longer be a stick to measure time, and the void is all that is left.That will only happen *after* the heat death of the universe. Currently, the cosmic microwave background radiation alone gives black holes above a certain mass more energy than they lose to Hawking radiation.What does Unnus Annus mean? There\u2019s a good YouTube channel named that.Lol I literally saw the week left video and realized I hadn\u2019t watched any of it yet and then Markiplier said \u201cif you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s too late to experience all of it.\u201d And I took that as a challengeEntropy is the ultimate apex predator.Anyone who wrote what you wrote will love this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA&t\n\nIt's a timelapse of the future. And the time-scale *doubles* every 5 seconds.\n\nBlack holes play a prominent part.Apparently time didn't exist before the big bang so there may yet being something above time in the cosmic food chainyeah but didn\u2019t Hawking prove that time has a starting point? I know he was trying to prove himself wrong after he proved that, but if time has a starting point, would that mean it has an end? \n\n\nAnd actually, since we can die, which stops time for us, doesn\u2019t that make Consciousness the predator of time? When all consciousness in the universe ceases to perceive time, is it still there? When the universe experiences heat death due to entropy, and there is no reference point for time, nor anyone to perceive that point if there was one, is time still passing, or did it end?\n\n\n\nif a tree falls and breaks my leg and nobody is there to see it, did I really break my leg\n\n\n\n\ni, too, am being purposefully melodramaticClarifying question: will this comment be deleted with the channel?Lmao I just found out about this and I love you for the edit.Memento moriSo time is the ultimate predator?so time is the biggest predator of all?The defeat of Entropy must be the final goal of humanity. A likely impossible task, deserving of accomplishment by the divinity of our cellular spark. The essence of life itself, to stall entropy, sets the stage for this final war. Just as in our lives now, there will come an end. But indeed as we now and forever before have strived against the dying of the light, we are all powered by the same will to live. It thrums an ever-burning need to live deep within our molecular soul.\n\nWe must stand against the purest of evil. For what is evil but that which opposes the collective consciousness of life? We are but creatures born to struggle. Without it, we are meaningless. So I call us angels yet to be delivered\u2014gods in utero. Seeing before us now the first truth we have ever known since we first absorbed another to work together for a greater goal. Aware of the depth of reality and our place in it, we now may see a unifying theory. A universal theory of life. A theological principle and a scientific fact paired in a symphony of purpose. From which we can draw direction, set forth upon the cosmos, launched from the cradle of life, and bring the war to the one true death.\n\nEntropy, I say, will be our grand Satan.\n\nAnd progress, unknowing, and uncertain, but forged in the heart of realities unforgiving knowledge, will be our mother. Guiding us forward, as we indeed are, one life. Trapped within the dying of the light. Stalling evil, moment by moment. Uncertain of a future, but steadfastly determined to form one from whatever it is we may one day become.\n\nWe are humanity. We are that which sees it self. And we coming for all that wishes harm. We will absorb you, and you will become of our future.\n\nEntropy will be our bitch.If people don\u2019t get that you\u2019re being melodramatic when you start your sentence with \u201cnay\u201d, I\u2019m not sure what else you could have done.i shouldn't be surprised a fellow cult member pops up here...Gollum:\n\nThis thing all things devours:\n\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers;\n\nGnaws iron, bites steel;\n\nGrinds hard stones to meal;\n\nSlays king, ruins town,\n\nAnd beats high mountain downMemento mori. \nDidnt expect to see an unus annus reference on such a random post lolLmao u said annusUnus Annus\n\n\nUnus Annus- Memento Mori - \n6 days -_-Unus.\n\nAnnus.\n\nUNUS.\n\nANNUS!Yeah no, massless particles can't be arsed to give a duck about time.

You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to\u00a0space.\u201dThat\u2019s not really \u201cpotato potato\u201d though. The radiation isn\u2019t eating the black hole. The radiation needs the black hole to exist the same way your turds need you in order to exist. The food chain isn\u2019t measured that way.The virtual particle explanation is common in popsci but doesn't really work. Hawking radiation is just normal particles from the unruh effect.Like sex? Gary's a rapistGary?He eats a lot more, he's just usually eating energy.Thank you for the simple explanation ZippyThanks! The only thing that confuses me is how does this sucking one of these particles away amount to the black hole creating the other particle? I have a totalg guess of an idea but doubt it's right....I\u2019m not a physicist, so this checks out.[deleted][removed]Nonstop Nut November?

It takes an obscenely long time for it to occur, and not a single one has decayed in the universe yet. The first to decay won't be for another 10^67 years or so.As best we can tell! \n\n[They slowly lose mass through Hawking Radiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation)\n\nEdit: figuring out link textyep! It's called hawking radiation. It has interesting implications. It's one of the reasons why tiny black holes aren't viable - they would decay very very quickly.For big ones: in many trillion years.  End-stage universe is gonna be a cold, dark environment.We can't know for certain, but at current understanding, they do. Hawking Radiation, if you want to look it up.\n\nIt's a very, very, very slow process tho.It's actually funny, the smaller they get, the faster they shrink. As a consequence, very small black holes are *intensely* radioactive.They\u2019re believed to due to Hawking Radiation that black holes evaporate slowly over time. I don\u2019t know much about this but it is an interesting thing to look upYes they do, but for any not-micro black hole radiation time is long enough to not worry about it unless universe itself is going for the heat death.Hail Sithis?Proton decay has not been confirmed yet.> there will no longer be a stick to measure time\n\nOr distance, since there'll only be photons and they don't experience both. So there's no way to tell whether the universe is really big or small.\n\nThere's a great video about it on PBS space time, [here.](https://youtu.be/PC2JOQ7z5L0)I'm pretty sure black hole decay is considered part of the heat death scenario.One year. I was basically channeling their energy for my post lol. Channel is being deleted. Only a few days left....One year.Lol, I've seen a video here or there but that was all until yesterday. On vacation from work, have Unnus Annus on my second monitor whenever I'm on the computer now lol. There's some fun content. And of course the weird, but that's expected and welcomed lol.markiplier: if you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s too late to experience all of it.\n\n[archive.org](https://archive.org): am i a joke to you?Let there be lightBeen looking for the right video for my trip all night but what i didn't know was that i was looking for this and only this.  Thanks buddy.>but if time has a starting point, would that mean it has an end?\n\nThere are loads of ends of time all over the place. They are in the centres of black holes.I suppose it would be my duty. Should I remember lol. Lmao u said UnnusIn a sexual sense, yesHolographic principle. \n\nSomething about you only needing the surface of a sphere to describe anything within the sphere. \n\nSo all the information found in a 3D space could just as well just be information on the 2D surface of that bubble. \n\nI definitely don't know the mathematics behind it.I'm out\n\nWhose kidneys are these?Until the computer says let there be light.Yo mama so fat, even black holes cant consume her wholegod damn.Thanks for making me think about the person that kept a flesh eating bacteria at bay by growing faster than it could eat them.> Nah kinda at the bottom it is after all the greatest lazy.\n\nWell, it's pursuit predation to its paroxysm.Yes, well a black holes doesn't really eat a planet any more than a cave eats someone who curls up an dies in it, or a cliff eats someone who falls off it. So if we are going to talk about a black hole as part of the food chain we are already playing pretty fast and loose with things.Yeah, but it could be argued that the radiation feeds off of the energy of the black hole maybe? It's all semantics anyway.Tom\u2019s friend. You know him.The mechanisms behind it are a little bit complicated, but the easiest way you can imagine it is that the two particles are of exact opposite charges and energy levels so that they second they pop into existence they collide with one another and destroy each other, but when one falls into the black hole, it cannot collide with its partner to destroy it so its partner escapes and becomes a real particle. This new particle escapes into the universe outside the black hole, and thus adds energy to the universe. Energy cannot cannot be created, it must come from somewhere, so the particle \"steals\" some of the energy from the black hole while it is escaping.Look up Hawking radistionWere calling that time, but most people don't think of that concept as what they perceive as time. I guess that's science, but time as considered by most  human does not exist, yes you can call the X in whatever equation you want \"time\" but that is not a true value because it's beyond the limits of our understanding. We assign a value but it makes no sense except to fit the model. It is wrong.Yeah but you failed while typing this comment instead of nutting.Septiembre sin fap gang rise upThought it was no simp septemberi\u2019ve never heard that phrase before but i love it[A few physicists would like to have a word with you.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end-20201029/)Bro it's fucking shower thoughts.

Memento mori. While it lasts. Unus Annus.Whimsical project made my Markiplier. Just look up Unus Annus on youtubeI definitely do. I'm from the future. I can't reveal any further information. \n\nSidebar, I was actually talking about Unus Annus, in case you really didn't know. I only found out last month, but it's a project between Markiplier and one of his best friends, and the channel and all it's videos will be deleted in roughly a week. It was basically a \"this exists for one year and tells a story, and then it goes bye bye\" kind of experiment.[deleted]Yes. I do bro. I\u2019m an expert on romejokes on you, any generation can be trolls.That's 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\n\nWe're presently 13,787,000,000 years from the Big Bang.username checks outHaven\u2019t micro black holes been generated by CERN that only last like a fraction of a nanosecond?\n\nI thought I heard that we did that at some point...Delete the space between the bracket and the parenthesis.Is very very quickly regarding universe time or human brain comprehension time?\n\nI.e does it fade in a million years still or like me blinking fast.So our descendants are all going to die in the end? What\u2019s the purpose of it all then? I honestly believe we are smart enough to create our own universes.That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may die.That's a positive thought.hold upI understood that reference.[deleted][Gary. ](https://youtu.be/rd8hYnG2464)[removed]Everyone above in this comment thread failed high school physics.\n\nLPT: Don't learn physics from the internet.[deleted]\"Herbivore\" means plant eater, and plants are only known to exist on Earth.  Thus, there is no known example of a black hole eating plants.\n\nIt's possible that plant-like life has fallen into black holes elsewhere in the universe, but the same is true of meat-like life.\n\nIn other words, citation needed.Man you are making zero sense. Not sure what you mean by \"lighten up\". Do you feel pressured or something?Ok. What does that have to do with stating that black holes are currently herbivores?This Ethan erasure is appalling.*and CrankgameplaysNo thanks!IndeedAlright my bad. Apologies.\n\nP.S I love the game too.That... is a lot of zeroes.so should i hold my breath or..?ThxLike nuclear explosion fast. Actually infinitely fast after a while since the decay rate is inversely proportionate to the holes mass, so the smaller it gets, the faster it sends out radiation.Let\u2019s get through our first billion years before making any long-term plans, eh?Yea man, absolutely nothing last forever. This all has a very good chance of not even being the first universe if its any consolation.Why would there be a purpose? \n\nPurpose is a concept we designate to objects that we have created to perform a specific task. You have a purpose in mind when you act. \n\nUnless you created the universe, or know someone who did, there's really no reason to expect it to have a purpose anymore than a rock having a purpose.The time scale discussed is practically beyond comprehension, and we really have no great idea for even the start of the end. 10^100 years, 10^10000. \n\nThere's concerns about the stability of DNA itself within millions or billions of years, though even given existing tech that might be addressed.\n\nWe've only even had steam power for a few centuries. If we're not all dead within the next thousand years, we'll likely have tech and resources we can't even conceive. Who knows.If it happens once, it will happen again. And purpose? Well, its better than nothing. Or nothing cant exist.(non being implies being.) Or both of those reasons.\n\nSource- am unemployed armchair philosopher.Doesn't change much in the grad scheme of things for human existence. \n\nNot that our descendants would be human anyways if they left the planet.r/HolUpThat's reddit for youIts crazy to think how we are all syncing clocks all the time.\n\nOne wonders if we did less of that if it might lower our stress levels.The internet has made learning physics vastly more accessible.\n\nLPT: You're not clever.The ones discussed in the link are most certainly not dead.earth is the only place we know of with meat. there are no black holes eating earth. therefore black holes don't eat meat...Didn\u2019t you see the roast? When this is over, Eef will be dead to 2.5 million people.It's not NSFW if you're worried, it's the name of a YouTube channel meaning \"one year\" in latin. Some big personalities started it last November with the idea of one video on some crazy topic per day for a year, after which they'll delete the channel and it'll be gone forever. It's getting talked about a bit more in places because they'll be deleting the channel on Friday.Which game? I heard this in the nonary games.67 zeroes to be exact.\n\nDisclaimer: I did not actually count the zeroes.You can go without oxygen for about 0.000005 years. So probably not.Could be universes all the way down for all we know.A purpose is not something we create in our minds, it's how nature works and our minds understands this idea.\n\n All the universe is moving and movement has direction and momentum, and direction means destination and its destination will lead to its purpose. Thats why we always talking about the beginning of the universe and its end. Cause we know thats how things work. So existence might not means something for you but it sure means something for a rock.\n\nNothing we know isn't acting this way, except time and we know it's moving into one direction which is the end of time and this is something we are still don't understand or sure of.Did you even read the article???Just because earth is the only planet THAT WE KNOW OF with meat, does not mean there are no other planets (or moons, asteroids, etc) that don't. You literally don't know that black holes have never consumed meat.That really took it from Eef to Oof.Dead by Daylight. an asymmetric PvP game where 4 people survive against a killerI heard it first in Persona 3, lol. Its theme was death, so kinda makes sense.It is 67 zeroes.\n\nSource: I countedThat is just tautology. Yes if you define somethings purpose as being whatever happens to it in the future, then yes everything that exists some point in the future can be said to have a purpose. It is an utterly pointless definition though that can't provide anything useful to work with.>A purpose is not something we create in our minds\n\nPurpose is an abstract concept that is absolutely something we created in our minds, specifically to assign a role to objects that we create or control for reaching a certain goal. More broadly and abstractly, it can be used to answer *why* questions about natural processes, but that is just a fallacious anthropomorphisation of nature. \n\nAsking *why* things fall doesn't imply that they have a *purpose* by falling. Things just fall due to how mass curves spacetime. Asking *why* mass curves spacetime isn't the same as saying that its *purpose* is to curve spacetime. It just does...\n\nIn fact, most if not all concepts are just ideas that we create in our minds. They are neat categories that we use to describe the world around us. They however aren't perfect and the world isn't black and white. It is a seething mess and exists, regardless of what false words we use to describe it. \n\n>All the universe is moving\n\nNot necessarily\n\n>direction means destination\n\nNot necessarily\n\n>destination will lead to its purpose\n\nAbsolutely not, unless you are using some divine interpretation. If you insist that *god* or some higher being is part of the scenario you are always going to run into problems looking for them. The problem isn't that the Universe does or doesn't have a purpose. The problem is that you are insisting that it has a purpose. \n\n>Cause we know thats how things work\n\nWe don't\n\n>So existence might not means something for you but it sure means something for a rock.\n\nAgain, this is some spiritual interpretation that you are forcing onto a rock. A problem that you ran into by anthropomorphing the rock in the first place. \n\n>Nothing we know isn't acting this way\n\nExcept everything is. Like I said, *purpose* is a concept that is really only applicable to objects that are created to assist in reaching a certain goal. \n\nA tree doesn't have a purpose. A chair has a purpose. Purpose is a subjective concept to the agent that uses the object for his activities. A rock has a purpose... for you if you decide to sit on it during a hike.[deleted]I think you're taking this joke way too seriously...For you as a sentient creature you define your own purpose, but the universe isn't bounded with yours nor obligated to your understanding, for you it will end and eventually fulfill its purpose. \n\nThe purpose of things and the universe or existence is a very philosophical subject and you souldn't expect an answer that you can put in a statement and feel you've accomplished the wisdom that will keep you moving in life, unless you want to rediscover religion or something.\n\nThe need of something to work with was the actual work of religion cause we as intelligent beings had to define our purpose to be able to tolerate reality and its horrible experiences and pains, so religions had a definition for this and it was good enough to work with.\n\nNow we want something better that make sense after our new understanding of the universe.\n\nWhat I meant is, as long as we still not sure of the purpose of something we need to work with how we really understand it.\n\nWe can imagine how the sun was created, how it works and how it ends. Then we can know what is its purpose, cause we don't think it will behave differently in the future and after it reaches its final destination, it won't be the matter of questioning anymore. So if you asked some ancient dude, what is the purpose of the sun? He should say to light up the world and send warmth etc, cause thats its purpose to him, but after our new knowledge and that we're not the center of things anymore, we can say that the sun is a part of a bigger system that behave in a certain way and its bounded with a certain path and cycle that will eventually end in a certain way and will have effects on certain things. \n\nBut you as a creature with choice that can affect your surroundings with no predictable behavior (I know this is very debatable) will have to define your purpose.No. But I can read... I see you avoided my question. You are really not making any sense.Says the person who has posted comment after comment trying to defend themselves. If it was really just a joke, why try so hard to be right about it? Or did you realize how wrong you were and decided to go with the \"I was just joking\" escape?",

He flies first class. Our competitor is owned by a man with a net worth maybe 1/10th of my bosses and flies privately. Some people just won\u2019t spend more money if they don\u2019t find value in it.That\u2019s not true. My work caters to millionaires and billionaires. A lot fly first class. One, a billionaire, flys coach. Why? \u201cThe cost of first class from Dallas to Vegas is egregious.\u201dFirst class flyer here. And no, I'm not rich. Not even the poorest. Just regular guys who travels a lot because of work. First class is full of sales person from different industries, most of the time.I'm curious how many people in first class paid for it at all? Upgrades are a pretty common reward for airline frequent flyer status holders.I had a colleague who traveled frequently.  He was taller than 6' 3\", and over 300 pounds, so he regularly upgraded to first class whenever possible. \n\nOn one flight, he realized that he was probably the only person on that flight who paid for their own ticket.  Most people in first class pass the bill for the ticket on to one of their clients.\n\nA side thought:  one of my older colleagues knew a high-profile sales executive that flew on the Concorde, 2-3 times a week, *just to network, talking to people and sniffing out future sales leads.*   He apparently did it for years, so I assume that the strategy got him a few clients a year, and his commissions were enough to keep gettin' on that plane.A friend in the industry gifted me a first class international ticket once, was pretty amazing. Infinite curry and a cheese bar. As much wine as you could drink. A private chef cooks you dinner. You're own private cabin with a bed and flat screen TV. Also everybody at the airport treats you like a celebrity when you show up.\n\nHoly shit it was unreal.\n\nI've been in a private jet as well, but only briefly for business. It was an executive jet. There was a couch and entire living room area with a wine rack at the back of the plane.And only the richest poor people fly at all.This ties into something I learned about a few months ago and *hate* because of how just, useless it seems. It's called Coded Luxury.\n\nBasically when you're really rich, you can spend ungodly amounts of money on outfits and objects that look like something you could get at TJMaxx, but are super luxurious. \n\nRich people buy high end brand names, like LV or Coach. *Rich* people spend thousands on custom clothing that have no labels, no logos, and look normal.The funny truth is that First class in a commercial plane is much more comfortable than a private jet.  Small, turbulent, less stable in flight, but offer privacy, no TSA and no waitUnless you're a student pilot, then you can be the poorest with a way better seat than first classI use to work for Delta airlines. 90% of those in people in first are not paying out of pocket. They're either upgrades from medallion status, standby (employee) or the most likely they're business men who have a company who pays for it.A lot more rich people fly coach than you think.There's a difference between having money and spending money.First class, and even private jets, is comfortable, but still not as comfortable as not flying at all.Many rich people think flying private is gauche because it's an ostentatious and environmentally problematic waste of money. You might be surprised how many filthy rich people are just normal people living their lives and spending money where it's worth actually spending; they're not all going way out of their way to blow a disproportionate amount just for the sake of it like the people you're likely to find on a private flight.Flights that are two hours or less I'll fly economy. Anything longer than that and I'm flying first class. I just get too uncomfortable and I'm more than willing to splurge a couple times a year for my comfort. \n\nThe last time we flew economy my wife spent the entire flight with the stomach of the guy sitting next to her resting on her leg. She couldn't even use her tray table because it would have hit his body. I'm willing to spend extra money to make sure we don't have to deal with that again.Oh here we go another Reddit circle jerk from commenters who know nothing about wealth.I was once bumped from an American Airlines flight and got 1st class seat as a benefit. A US Senator got to board to the flight early, but she sat behind me in coach as I was in First.My friend said after flying first class he isn't flying coach ever again. I was never frequent and I somehow went my whole life on near empty or half filled planes. That all changed after flying spirit to Vegas. The second time it was bad I thought it was a fluk and the last time I saw a greasy fat dude cough into the soda machine at bk. I was telling my friend about it when we sat on the plane. Ended up having him sit next to me locking me in with his greasy fat ass. Not to mention the 2 delays I had with spirit. One time the toilet overflowed so they \"fixed\" it, we boarded, then had to get off. The second they took one of the pilots off in a stretcher. Somehow he broke his foot in a fight or something. Moral of the story is spirit is cheap and you get what you pay for.I'm definitely not rich, \n(maybe in another 20 plus years I'll be hopefully comfortably well off) \nbut next time I ever fly to travel I intend to splurge on a 1st class ticket.\nI used to like flying, but The older I get I've grown to hate it.\nThe lines and all the security you have to go thru seem to increase every year. I get it, I understand it. You definitely want it to be safe.\nbaggage checking and pickup, the waiting, lines, \nwaiting to board, waiting for people to cram their oversized luggage that should have been checked to be crammed into the overhead.\nJust a general feeling of hating being around lots of people, loud, smelly, noisy, crying children, or kicking back of your chair.\nI have no plans to ever fly if I can avoid it, but at some point I'm going to want to take a trip somewhere again.\n\nI was able to fly 1st class a couple times, got lucky and was upgraded once.\nThe other time (I worked as a private chef for a few years) I was flown 1st class to cook for the 80th birthday party for a client.\n\nIn my case, The 1st class legroom is going to be worth every penny.I don't need to be pampered on a plane. I just need legroom. I go for business class every time if that's an option.This is not really true.Or they care about their money so their don't spend it unnecessary and cause problemsAnd those poorest rich people have a better time because first class on an airline like Singapore airlines is much much more luxurious than a private jet. The catch being the lack of flexibility with commercialThis is what poor people think rich people do. Actually many rich people south of billionaires fly first class out of convenience. You try to book a private jet 90 min before take off? Yea you can\u2019t. But you can ussually get a first class seat going there.Huge difference in this conversation between folks who fly within the states and those who fly intercontinental.First class is a requirement for me due to the *needed* legroom or else I couldn't fly at all.Man fuck you, I barely got to the point where I csn fly first class lol \nTook me 36 yearsMeh.  Flying private is wasteful and terrible for the environment.  I'll pay for first (and business) tickets because it's worth it to me.  I've flown private several times and the cost (both financial, but also in terms of what it does to the environment) is not worth it to me.  I don't fly private anymore and probably never will again.When I was flying with my young son many years ago, we were walking through first class. He was asking where our seats were and I pointed towards the back of the plane while explaining that these seats were \u201cfirst class.\u201d  He then stopped, looked up at me and asked if we were second class.   Out of the mouths of babes. \ud83d\ude01To feel rich, poor people fly it too sometimes.Haven\u2019t seen it mentioned here so: I\u2019ve known some very wealthy people who always fly commercial, never private, because commercial is much much safer (allegedly, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t done the research, but they have).I mean\u2026 my ass is still back there between the fucking luggage and some motherfucker that brought his own spaghetti\n\nI ain\u2019t trying to pretend the people in first class are chumps \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fMike Tyson prefers to fly first class. Even though he could fly private. Which is surprising considering he beat that man on the airplane.A smart billionaire who wishes to remain so flies business or first. The comfort is appreciated and it doesn\u2019t break the bank like private jets do.\n\nTo fly in first from miles\u2026. You have to spend your time in the airport and doing intercontinental flights. Even when I was flying every week I didn\u2019t achieve that status. I could upgrade myself to business but you do that on exceptionally long or night flights.OP needs to look up the First Class Suites on Etihad, Emirates or Singapore Airlines. I think not understanding true First Class vs domestic American first class is a big part of misunderstanding where wealthy people spend their time and money on actual first class tickets.Not to contradict this, but some of the wealthiest people I know still fly coach. Most of whom I know that fly first are my peers that just bump themselves up using airline pts. \n\nI always assumed it came down to those who are wealthy know how to invest, and investing in something that lasts for 2-5 hours and makes you no better off at the end, just doesn\u2019t seem like a good investment.Many of the richest people just fly commercial (even coach) because they give no fucks and don't want to waste money on frivolous bullshit.This is a friendly reminder to [read our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules).\n\nRemember, /r/Showerthoughts is for showerthoughts, not \"thoughts had in the shower!\"\n\n(For an explanation of what a \"showerthought\" is, [please read this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview).)\n\n**Rule-breaking posts may result in bans.**Are those people on the top of the poor pile or the bottom of the rich pile?Idk I saw snoop dog board first class at Reagan in DC on his way to do a show in Miami in 2015ish I think? Snoops pretty loaded.My planes in the shop.That's not true. I once flew first class (free upgrade) Budapest to JFK with George Soros two rows in front of me. My dad almost got arrested in customs because he took a picture of Soros posing with the rest of my family.That's true. I work with a bunch of wealthy people and all of them fly charter. Not saying it's a G5 type, some fly a twin engine prop from San Francisco to LA quite a bit. It's about convenience more than the money.This is true.  The owners of my last 3 companies are billionaires.  They all have private jets.  Someone drives them right to the jet, it gets them to their location quickly and they can work on the drive from the plane to the next destination.  The super rich people I\u2019ve worked for work 20 hour days 7 days a week.  Every minute counts.I've flown first class from Paris to NYC once. I fit into that group. It was cool but would never do it again. Just get the extra leg room and chill. \n\nIt's honestly strange up there. Free food, lots of it. Like really nice food. Free booze, all you can drink. Cheese plate and desert. Seat went all the way down but it was a day flight so just took a little nap. \nThey give you a menu and really pamper you...fuck just thinking about it maybe I'll do it again.Actually, first class is usually predominately populated by people with very high mileage accounts or those flying for business. Not rich, just a ton of miles. My guess is that in any 12-person first-class section that 10 of the passengers, maybe 11 didn't pay for their seats. They either used miles or they are flying on their company's dime.Maybe for domestic first class (which is more like international premium economy), but plenty of celebs that have money fly first class internationally, just depends. Billionaires are a different breed I guess, they don't count.And only the richest poor people fly at all.I use to fly private jets (as a pilot)...\n\nSome of our clientele did both.... But the very wealthy only flew private for the most part...   \n\nThe \"poorest\" clients we had probably had over 10 million disposable income...\n\n\nAlso... A trip from NY to South Florida might be 3-4 hrs x 8-10k/flight hour...  You are looking at 40k for a ONE WAY trip from NY to FL.  \n\n\nFucking ridiculous.I know plenty of multi millionaires that fly coach. You don't have to be frugal to make money but it sure helps to hold on to it.A long time ago I managed to save enough airline points for a 1 hour first class flight from CA to OR. It was stupid but I had a job interview and the points would have expired before I ever used them.\nIt was the first time I ever tried hummus, and the only time an airline employee ever treated me like a human being.\n\nI don\u2019t really make enough to afford basic human respect these days. But hummus is actually really good with some fresh garlic and a little chili sauce.I have a really good friend that has another good friend who recently sold his company for a lot of money. Like a lot, lot. One of the first things he did was buy a private jet. No more frequent flyer bitch miles for my boy.My family is only middle class but when we do fly we kinda don\u2019t have a choice but to fly first class because of how heavy we areAnd they tell us not to use fossil fuels while using private jets.The really rich have private jets cause of time saving it is.Imagine being able to fly first knowing you\u2019ll never be able to afford private.where i am from only riche fly at allI flew coach with a well known millionaire so ya lol... Take it how you will.Not true at all. Sometimes even when stupid rich it makes sense to fly first let alone get all the amenities of first class lounge/flight service especially flying intlThere once was a VW commercial way back when kind of explaining this (even though they made the point a couple times) but that rich who like to splurge in lavish places already live cheaply. The commercial kinda follows this couple at a nice restaurant ordering the most out of anybody, and everyone is very bewildered at it. When they leave to the parking lot outside they go to the beetle, the cheapest car in the lotMy sister's best friend married an actual billionaire.  He had a private jet, but he sold it because he concluded it was a ridiculous waste of money, and he just flew first class after that.  (Although he did still charter private jets every once in a while when he was flying with a group of his buddies, like going on vacation or to the Superbowl or something.)Counterpoint- business trips that require an overnight flight.Most millionaires/billionaires dont actually own their planes but are shared among 3 or 4 people. Its been my experience at least. Ive flown on several private jets and big ass ones too (as a guest or on business for clean water projects while fund raising) and even the few 300m-500m net worth guys share planes with $1B guys. Especially companies Ive met with heading to Belize or Sudan etc.Whenever i fly home from the USA to London, I've always traveled first class. Being on a plane for that long, it's soooooo worth it.So sick of worrying about money.I fly business class. Am I like the scum on the poor rich person\u2019s shoe? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02Do you mean the richest poor people?Some people flying first class are airline employees/family of employees traveling stand by.I\u2019m by no means rich. I haven\u2019t flown economy in over 5 years because i always get upgraded. You don\u2019t need to be wealthy to fly business/first class, you just need to travel enough to have airline status so you get free upgrades. Most of the people you see sitting up there - the vast majority by a wide margin - are like me, they aren\u2019t rich and they didn\u2019t pay for those seats, they have jobs that require them to travel so their company books them in economy and they receive seat upgrades.I fly on private jets occasionally and often in first class. \n\nI would prefer a first class any day over anythjng smaller than a mid-large size private jet. \n\nThe service is better and it\u2019s more comfortable. \n\nYou do save time in a private jet which is an advantage tho.Or the richest poor peopleNo, yeah, you\u2019re actually right.Or the richest poor people...Are they the poorest rich people or the richest poor people?The trick to being rich is not primarily to make a ton of money, but to keep a ton of money.\n\nI bet a lot of them just fly business or even coach.I used to volunteer and we had to split into groups of two. I got grouped with a CEO of some medical company and he was telling me how he was making a million dollar salary and would fly first class with his wife. I think he could have flown private as it cost around $2k-$5k per hour because flying private charges by the hour, but he didn't feel the need to drop that amount of cash for just a few hours..Private isn't so great. Small planes are bumpy and that landing sucksI only fly first class. Mainly because I'm 6'5\". But I'm also poor. Hence, I don't travel much.This is true. I've seen countless D list celebrities on flights, ones that were even as brief as 2 hours. Always first class.I have a close friend that's a .01%er. Except for when they felt their life was in danger, and they needed to be out of a country on the first plane out, they never fly private. Nor do they own their own jet (to my knowledge).   \n\n\nWhat I've realized by knowing this person, is that a lot of us have misconceptions about what the REALLY rich do. The reality is, they do whatever the fuck they want, because they can.I often think something similair when I see a Porsche Boxter\n\nIs that someone who just likes the car? Or is that someone who\u2019s rich enough for a Porsche and wants to show off but couldn\u2019t afford the 911.\n\nNot a judgment. Just a thought, I can\u2019t afford a fuckin\u2019 Hyundai.I fly first class a lot but I\u2019m not what you\u2019d consider rich. I fly a lot business for work and points upgrade when I can. I\u2019ve reached that bitter point now though that I\u2019d rather not fly at all.All these comments talking about \"i know a billionaire/millionaire that fly in coach\"\n\nYeah. The post says the RICHEST fly privately, not that billionaires ONLY fly in first class.Flying first class just means you have a job with a healthy budget, or reward points.No, the poorest rich fly business class.First Class is usually frequent flyers with status that get upgraded for free.I remember Peter Jones, a British billionaire saying about his kids first experience flying in a non private jet, his daughter turned to him and said \"daddy, what on earth are all these people doing on OUR plane?\"Only the richest rich people fly private actually. It\u2019s a lot more expensive then you would think.I\u2019ve been in first class 3 times and never paid for it. Just used travel miles. I imagine a lot of people get bumped up to first class as an apology for random stuffStupid.\n\nMost people in first class are folks who travel frequently for work, and upgrade themselves using miles/points.Thankfully I don't have this issue anymore as I've dropped a ton of weight, but when I was near 300 lbs I didn't have a choice but to fly first class. Coach was too uncomfortable and I had flights where the seat belt wouldn't reach over and I was too embarrassed to ask for an extender. I would place my jacket over to make the attendant think it was clippedi wish i was that poorThat's how they STAY richI don\u2019t think most people flying first class are rich, also you can get upgraded if you fly a lot for work and stuff.[deleted]I read somewhere that if your in first class and not rich, unless your that reckless with money, you're smartHahaha loves making this realization as an adult. First class is actually directorate level business people and upper middle class people. I work with private jets for my job. There\u2019s whole levels of rich guys there too. Dudes that rent to dudes that own 747s converted to private jets. Private jets are about 10k an HOUR to run. Gotta be pretty rich to own and run one. Most rockstar and actor type people charter jets per trip. No first class but also not owning their own 65mil plane.A lot of business class sometimes fly firstOr is it the richest poor people?Yeah it goes in order of hierarchy of money, Top level is you own a really nice plane,with pilot, the works. Next level is you have access to a private nice plane, like a CEO of a company or you have a rich uncle. The next level is pseudo private, like a Netjet account, you fly first class style accommodations, but without all of the other people around, and they take you directly where you want to go. The next level is simply first class flight.The rich go to space to play, and I'm going to take a rocket.[deleted]This is true. I\u2019ve flown 1st and business more than my fair share. But I have a relative who may have never flown in either. Because he uses his own jet. It\u2019s a tad obnoxious. I make it a point to never ask him about his travels lest I barf.So weird that you should say this because I just got off of a plane today and I was one of the first ones to get my bags and go to leave when this lady in first class explained to me that the first class people get to get off first. And I said, \"Interesting.\" and got off before her.\n\nAlso, can someone explain why people like to be the first ones to board a plane? Like, the seats are assigned. It's not general admission. Why is it a privilege to get on first to sit there longer waiting for the rest of the people to board?\n\nedit typoThat doesn't make sense, flying private has a much higher environmental cost, I'd like to think there are many rich people who would prefer a first class flight for that reason alone, regardless of relative wealth.Nope. It's business folks getting free upgrades for frequent flying on the company dime.  You're just another wageslave/salaryman.  I used to fly an absurd amount and that was the majority of 1st classers over time. About half the flights I took would get 1st class upgraded for nothing. If you're doing +200k miles/year they want you coming back so you get 1st for free.The richer rich people have their own jets, or a fractional. They don't fly commercial.Idk why everyone\u2019s talking about leg room lol I\u2019m literally 6\u20197 and make it work on cross country flightsI fly best class. The pilot has to suck me off before take off.Or the smart very rich peopleHaha yea fuck those rich peasantsGood oneNope, we fly economy plus.  I am not spending 4 grand on an 8 hour flightOnly domestic.\n\nEven the rich fly 1st class internationally.\n\nPrivate jets don\u2019t have the fuel to make the trips directly, have worse turbulence, and the amenities on 1st class international are pretty great.I had a first class ticket for $90 from Austin to LA because I was gonna pay $25 extra to check an extra bag anyways and the upgrade was just $40 more and let me check an extra bag for free.  I believe this was South West.  \n\nIt's hardly a rich person luxury unless you're traveling internationally, in which case you're already traveling internationally so you're still closer to regular first class travelers than they are to private plane passengers.The rest fly* private.\n\nBad grammar in the shower is what is killing us.The poor stay poor by acting rich, the rich stay rich by acting poor. \nThere are an awful lot of wealthy people who know money is not something they need to flaunt to be rich.This is incorrect to a point, there are people who barely have a six figure net worth that choose to splurge and fly first class- which in a sense is why they will remain to have a six figure net worth.\n\nThen you have the smart rich people who are worth 50+ million but choose to fly coach because they don't believe in making senseless purchases for simple conveniences. \nWhich in part is how they got to be worth 50+ millionEat the RichHmmmm, Usually cost me $50 to upgrade to first class if there is any available. When you take the cost of paying for drinks and an extra baggage, sounds like a pretty smart financial decision to meFun Fact: anyone here claiming to fly \u201cfirst class\u201d is full of shit as it\u2019s called Business Class other than a small handful of airlines that only have a handful of routes that have a First Class. An easy way to tell if someone has actually done it. First Class has been mostly replaced with PJs which is why it\u2019s not available on like 99% of flights.So middle classYou saw that back and forth between glen and rob too?Idk, you get to have a Bloody Mary before takeoff.  And let's be honest for a moment here.  When you make, decent money, the cost for business or first class or whatever you want to call it is petty cash.  You don't worry about these things anymore.  \"Do I treat myself well?\" isn't a question or a tradeoff, it's just what you do because you want to.  Or don't.  It's not very complicated.Only the poorest of rich guys have a Rolex (maybe barring some of the solid gold models)And smart everyday people.I went on a plane onceStill subject to the same laws of physics. \n\nKobe!Only the dumbest fly private. You are so much more likely to die in a smaller plane.This isn\u2019t entirely true, one of the richest folks I know in the music industry(songwriter/producer) could DEFINITELY fly private, he\u2019s worth 50+ million, but thinks it\u2019s a waste of money so doesn\u2019t, and some of his friends have given him a hard time because of course they want to fly private with him, and them charter a plane together.[deleted]Totally disagree. Just as many very wealthy people fly coach, (yes it\u2019s true), plenty of very wealthy choose to fly commercial as opposed to private. And I would venture to say that many of the poor rich fly private to try and prove their wealth, kind of like the newly rich but expensive cars and showy items.\nUh what does this even meanYeah, most of us don't know about the secret 0th class, very fancy, they give full body massages and the good booze, served in golden diamond encrusted gobletsAnd richest poor people fly economyI don't see the point in amassing a tonne of wealth. I'd need trillions of dollars and have to live to be at least 500 years for it to be worth it. Until then I'll daydream and be content with the little things and bonus surprises.Nah, you've get it mixed up. The vast majority of the world's \"rich\" can't afford private. The ones that can are the richest of the richest.Got bumped to first class after my flight depressurized and had to make an emergency landing.\n\nYeah, thanks a fucking ton after you almost killed me!!!Fuck all of them.  Conspicuous consumers.Some rich people prefer 1st class because they like watching the poor walk down the aisle after them, looking at their 1st class seat enviously.Now that\u2019s a great shower thoughtEh not reallyI have other people fly for me.\n\n/sI mean, some do, but it's usually when they aren't paying, their company is.Yeah sure if by \"only\" you mean the vast majority and \"the rest\" means a small percentage.Unless you're Mark Cuban with a golden ticket.Fo reall.Ha! So true!Or if you fly enough and have joined their frequent flyer program you can get upgraded to first class most of the time. There\u2019s paying for it cuz you can and not paying for it because you\u2019re smarter than that.Ha that's my boss lolYou may be surprised by the number of extremely wealthy folks who have their jets drop them at JFK so they can catch a commercial suite seat to the middle east or asia.  This includes people who have jets that can make that kind of trip.I love being the worst player on the best team, so I'm cool with this.The poorest 90% of rich people. I count anyone as rich who can afford a relatively luxurious lifestyle without working. Ten million or more net worth depending on where they live.A lot of first class flyers are just business people who don\u2019t spend a lot of time at homeI know a billionaire who, when he doesn't take his private jet, flies economy. \"First class is stupid expensive!\"And it's so different flying private vs commercial first class it's almost a different ballpark.Private is also limited on distance.  Wealthy people will still fly commercial for long distance flights.And the richest poor people fly in economy classI know a lot of really rich people who fly coach.I've gotten a bunch of free first class upgrades the past year.  It's so much better.Isn't it usually just filled with busine..... nevermind, a company wouldn't pay above cheapest possiblePewDiePie flew private to Japan and it cost about $200,000This is true. I\u2019m not rich. If I\u2019m flying over an ocean I find a way to pay for 1st or premium class. It makes a huge difference in how I feel after a long flight. Flying economy on a long flight is very uncomfortable. Planes used to have more room in economy/coach, but now they pack people in like sardines. Yes it\u2019s always full of old people like me.No, there are some rich MF\u2019s that fly first. Remember commercial has a way better safety record than private.I once saw will I am fly first class so not sure I can completely agreeYou might not even be rich. My brother has to fly about 10 times per year on average and he always checks the first class prices just in case. Every once in a while he gets a lucky find and flies first class for not much more than a normal ticket (maybe 1.5x)Feels like the dumbest rich people fly privateI've read that in *certain* situations, chartering a private jet is actually cheaper than first class.And the richest poor people.You'd be surprised.Don't tell Jack Harlow.I just upgraded my flight next week from economy to first class for an extra $100. When you take into account that it includes free checked bag, lounge pass, in-flight food and drinks, and extra comfy seat, it's worth it.If you're actually poor but want the first class experience, get a business class seat at 1/3 of the price (but it's about 3x the price of coach).First class as a concept is getting smaller. A lot of airlines have eliminated the First Class cabin\u2019s to increase Business seating. Smart rich people know First Class isn\u2019t worth it and just fly Business instead.Not entirely true if the individual in question doesn't travel a lot. No point shelling out millions for a private jet, fuel & a hangar to put it in if you only make 1 trip a year.The truth is this: \u201cPoor people like to be rich, and rich people like to be poor.\u201d\n \nIt's not the rule, but it's the majority.Knew a guy (still know him, but knew him before too) that was in the million mile flier club with Continental. Always flew coach, took advantage of any mile coupons he could. Twice a year took his wife on a vacation overseas, used miles to upgrade to first class for those trips.\n\nHe could've easily bought and justified a private jet, just wasn't worth it to him. He also wore shirts from JC Penney.Isn't first class actually BETTER than private though?\n\nAside from the convenience of being able to schedule exactly when you want to leave, private is, from what I've read, worse. Smaller planes = lower altitude = more turbulance. Also longer flight times for comparable routes. Less luxurious lounges, less amenities and options on board (albeit shared in first I suppose). Less cabin crew. \n\nMaybe if I was famous I'd fly private instead of first (avoid the crowds and attention), but otherwise first seems fabulous.I had a client who was in the private jet business and he once told me that there's an easy way to spot the rich vs the wealthy. When rich people get onto a private jet, they stop and take hundreds of pictures first. Wealthy people just walk on to the plane.I thought some flies business classIt\u2019s people who fly for work who fly first class. My boss has been flying at least twice a month, often twice a week, for almost 40 years. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s flown economy since the first Clinton Administration.Most rich people who dont travrl for work, are too busy to travel anyways. Then if you are at a higher tier you probably just own your own plane.I will never look at people seated in first class the same againShrugs in Southwest.this reminds me of elon musk jet https://nitter.net/ElonJetI'm short enough that I can stand up at my seat and not hit the overhead compartment, so I'm fine saving money and sitting in coach.I feel the same way when I see fancy waterfront houses but they're right next to the freeway bridge. Yeah, you're rich but you're not RICH-rich or you wouldn't be living next to that.Most people in the front of the plane are mile runners from [flyertalk.com](https://flyertalk.com) hahaOr unless you get free upgrades to first class but youre still poor.Actually only the richest poor fly first class. The poorest rich have jetsI don\u2019t get it.Lol trueI've flown both and I prefer commercial for international trips. The pampering is part of the deal and the cost is much lower vs. chartering your own flight. Plus you don't have to worry about catering.  The only reason to fly private - as I see it - is when you can't reliably book a business or first class cabin for a short to medium-haul trip that you *have* to make on short notice. The only nice upside to private is you don't have to wear a mask for the duration of the flight if it's your own plane. Some of those jet share services still require masks.\n\nOtherwise - masks aside - commercial business or first is good enough for me. And I get points and a glass of booze when I board.I reread the subheading 1/2 a dozen times trying to understand the joke.  Then I realized I wasn't in r/jokes.\n\nCan someone post the 'godzilla had a stroke trying to read this headline and died' meme.Yea this a L joke. You drive 12th class foshoWas looking at a private school and then I heard one kid making fun of another kid because that kid flew first class instead of private. Easy decision to send my kids to publicWhile I certainly could afford first class tickets for me and my family I\u2019d rather spend it on my actual vacationThis is actually a good shower thought.Not necessarily\u2026it is possible to be very rich but also prudent.Nah, my dad was a building surveyor for architectural firms and corporations.  He would fly to a couple cities every week.  He built up hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) of flyer miles.  He always got upgraded to first class.  It was awesome when he could take us with when we were young as I got to experience a lot of the luxury but we lived a pretty average life financially speaking.Don\u2019t forget about the airline employees. It\u2019s quite cheap to fly first and business when you work for the airline plus buddy passes for family/friends \u263a\ufe0fYou should probably not equate spending money to being rich.I reject the whole idea of first class.   \n\nIt's artificial scarcity, the plane or train will lug that weight with it anyway.   \nMeanwhile I have to preselect myself as second class.    \nYou're not telling me that doesn't do something to a human psychologically.Reminds me when I read China Rich Girlfriend and the puffed up spoiled banker millionaire was shocked his billionaire client was flying economy.They can pay to give a fuckNot the best of shower thoughts. I don\u2019t agree at all- the most environmentally mindful rich person will fly first class commercial. And much of them do. Just because they can afford private, doesn\u2019t mean they do. Or even want to. Many smart rich people acknowledge that flying private is a huge waste of fuel and harmful to the environment. Even some of the British royalty fly commercial first class. Try taking another showerI dunno about this, I\u2019ve flown first class w/ guys that own jets. If it doesn\u2019t make sense, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Spend 25-30k on 2 first class tickets while your jet makes $60k that week, or take the jet and spend close to $20k on fuel and staff?No. If you have 8 or more people in your party, hiring a private jet  can be much cheaper than all you flying coachA family friend has some crazy amount of flight miles and he never uses them (he flies around for work) so he always gets really good deals because of it. He usually sits in first class by paying regular money for flights.For some reason I remember the punch line being \"Wow you have seventy five dollllars\"I remember talking to buddies about going on a booze cruise to try out a bunch of breweries in the area and their reaction when I suggested we rent a limo for the night. Started sarcastically suggesting we get tuxedos and act all like rich pompous assholes to drink beer, then me having to explain that once you hit that needing 2, possibly 3 cabs for the night, it's just easier and cheaper to rent a limo. Divided 8 ish ways, we're spending less, we have a personal driver waiting on us that we just text when we're ready to go, get the bill and there he is outside when we're done. Because the back passenger compartment is separate from the drivers area we can keep drinking there.\n\nLimos are just sensible when you're going out in a group.I've been watching Succession lately. Sure, you expect them to get chauffeured around, but these billionaires don't ride in limos, they ride in sedans, SUVs, and vans. Certainly from high end manufacturers like Mercedes, but not as long and as obnoxious as limos.[deleted]I got a limo leaving a canucks match because we didn't have to wait and my wife had never been in one. $80 cad well spent for the experience for her.[removed]The one I don't get is when people leave the sticker on their hat to brag that it's an authentic MLB new era 59fifty.\n\nLike \"wow dude, you have $50 of disposable income, we're all so impressed.\"Reminds me of something I heard once at a family members\u2019 place in the Hamptons:\n\n> \u201cThe ^rich people here drive Porsches, Bentleys, Ferraris; but the *really* Wealthy people here are usually the ones in the 30-year-old Volvo with rust holes in the fenders.\u201dREAL rich people show up in a car they own being driven by a person they ~~own~~ employI remember when I was younger I used to assume every time I saw a limo it was someone rich or famous.  But in reality it was probably some high school kids on their way to a dance.  Or one time my mom and aunt took a limo to a concert because it wasn't much more expensive then parking in the city.I\u2019m the fortunate son of a wealthy man, it varies. He sent two interns transatlantic first class because he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to suffer coach for that long, why should they?\u201d As a family we fly private sometimes, coach most of the time and I think first class only once in my life. \n\nHe drove 6 hours on business for some reason the other week and insisted on taking my Accord because the gas was cheaper than his Merc. Top quality dude, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.That shrewdness actually tends to be how people build or maintain that wealth so yeah.private jets unless you go for very big planes aren't more comfortable than first class with a major non-us airline. \n\nSingapore airlines has suites for exampleThe rich folk I know don't flex their wealth. Whenever I see somebody who does I immediately think they are broke or distasteful.\n\nThere is even people who rent 5 minutes on a plane at the hangar, do a photo shoot and then bugger off to fly coach.It can be a pain in the ass to organize a private flight also. Sometimes just easier to book the ticket. It's why I've also met a billionaire flying southwest. He needed a ticket, they had oneI've always assumed that one of the biggest perks of flying private was the time savings. You don't have to show up 2 hours early, deal with the security lines, wait for your bags, etc. Also, it is likely that a smaller airport is closer to your home, so the commute is less. \n\nIf I have a 4 hour flight and I can cut 2-3 hours off all the crap that a commercial airport entails, I have just gained 2-3 productive (or relaxing) hours and now the travel is just part of my day, not the whole damned thing.Yeah I feel like rich rich people don\u2019t waste their money on a private jet[deleted]Its this mindset that helps propel ppl to wealth. Can\u2019t just turn off a mindset.Also flying first class versus private is better for the environment.We all know the real wealthy drive old Volvos and use coupons at McDonald'sSo this one billionaire I know spends $35,000 or so each way on charter flights to fly him and his wife to one of their several homes around the US. (He used to own a private jet but is now retired.) One (beautiful!) home is part of a country club setup where the median price for homes is about six million US. Membership of the club is optional, but costs $30K per year. My friend doesn't play golf or tennis, but he and his wife love the food at the club's restaurant which boasts a French-trained chef - so he pays the annual membership fee, even though they spend perhaps four weeks each year in that home. So my girl and I went to visit the couple at that home (we've been to the others also) and I discovered that the Internet service there was rather poor. I did a quick online check, then let him know he could get 1 gigabit fiber at that location, for something like $70 per month. No, he said, he doesn't want to spend that much on Internet service!\n\nWhich is one of my favorite stories, about how we all have things we'll spend a lot on, and things on which we won't - even billionaires!It\u2019s also not true because flying private on long haul isn\u2019t actually great compared to some long haul commercial airlines in first. For instance emirates and Thai are both better appointed and more comfortable than flying private and have more amenities. Also if you hit turbulence you want to be in as big a plane as possible. Hitting a storm in private ain\u2019t cute.\n\nSource: have flown all of them. Short flights = private ftw. \n\nAnything longer, go major airline with good first. \n\nEmirates have the best cabins. Emirate class is like having your own apartment. Like you can walk around naked in your private suite. \n\nThai has the best service.\n\nSwiss has the best food and wine.\n\nBA you always meet celebs/famous/interesting people.My wife and I own a small, moderately successful business the nature of which involves a lot of travel, (more than half the year), both domestic and international. On a 2 hour domestic flight I might pay for business if it's discounted. I won't pay full fare ... domestic business class is hardly better than coach.  International flights are another story. I will almost always buy business tickets for long haul travel.Can vouch for this - used to fly private jets for wealthy clients.I work in general aviation. The amount of wealth that own their own jets or charter private jets is astounding.I'm sure you can't tell us, but I would LOVE to know what *billionaire* is penny-pinching so hard that they choose to fly coach. There's no way that the cost of any flight ever for them is more than a drop in the oceanThis is one of those little tidbits/anecdotes that I've heard a lot before. The truly savvy rich people who worked their way up through blood, sweat and tears tend to be the ones who still drive old beater cars, fly coach and other such things because they think it's stupid to waste tens of thousands of dollars on a fancy car when the same one you've been driving for ten years still works just fine and gets you from point a to point b, and that you're still gonna land at the same destination no matter what seat you're in. Seems like a damn reasonable line of thinking honestly.I was looking for a comment like this^^There's two types of rich people, the frugal and the extravagant. Some wear a t-shirt and jeans and show up in a Honda accord. Others wear suits and show up in limos. Usually the ones in the accord are the truly rich ones.Good. It\u2019s the sheer principle of the thing for me. To this day I refuse to pay for a soda at a sit down restaurant because I know the restaurant is charging like a 2000% markup on that shit even though I make six figures and a $4 soda would have zero impact on my financials. I know it\u2019s not really comparable to being a billionaire, but it\u2019s the same principle: no matter how much money you have, never pay for something that just isn\u2019t worth it.My dad gets first class upgrades all the time due to flying to Europe and Asia regularly for sales stuff. He hit diamond just before the pandemic which is their top tier I think with sky miles. So he gets a boat load of stuff. Plus credit cards thar generate miles etc.I'm up here in my Lululemons and t-shirt knocking back infinite double whiskeys. C-ya around buddy![deleted]I think you're confusing \"First Class\" for \"Business Class\" UA, AA, DL have all muddied the waters especially on their domestic routes by calling their business product \"First\" but it ain't. Unless you've flown First on LH, SQ, EK, or LX, you've not actually flown First. I booked a ticket on LH F (on points, since, well it was only 30,000 more for First over Business) and they came to pick me up from the hotel in a Porsche Cayenne.You have to spend a lot of money and trips flying coach to get enough points where\nYour status gives you free upgrades to first class. So poor folks tend not to get those upgrades. \n\nThe caveat is if your company pays for you to fly for business purposes. But chances are that you would be in a position where again, you are not poor.I got upgraded to first on my first flight which was to Mexico City :)Not internationally.I pay for it because I fly so little. I'm a bigger guy and usually only fly domestic so the cost isn't absurd and it's worth the comport for myself. It's also usually Delta 1st class which isn't anything special.I fly first / business often.  It's either points or when I get to the desk of the airline I ask for a deal,  which they usually have one.  No idea how ppl pay the prices advertised on the website.I get upgraded all the time.  As soon as I sit down my not paid for seat I start to scoff at all the poor people shuffling past me on their way to economy.[deleted]>Upgrades are a pretty common reward for airline frequent flyer status holders.\n\nI fly maybe 2 times a year. I'll never have enough points to be upgraded. Most people (according to a quick google) take 2.5-6.5 flights per year. Also seeing 1.4 in 2021. \n\nAnyway, I suspect most of them probably paid for it, or it was paid for by their work.My husband and I spent nearly every dollar of our wedding on our AMEX card (paid it all off each month, but we wanted the points). We have hundreds of thousands of points, and I priced out a trip with a hotel flying first class to Chicago recently through AMEX and Travelocity. Using the points actually cost $6,000 more. I think points are a scam...Plus business travelers especially on trans ocean flightsCurious as to how he realized people weren\u2019t paying for their own tickets just by flying with them? Like did a flight attendant mention it or how did that work?I am 6\u20193, 300 lbs. Can confirm that first class something I have to factor into my travel budget without question.First class tickets for flights feels like a textbook example of price sensitivity or lack thereof. It\u2019s always easier to spend someone else\u2019s money.Infinite curry and cheese on an international flight really seems to tempt the fates.If first class is sufficiently empty, they will sometimes set up the adjacent seat as your bed seat and your current seat as your upright seat so you don\u2019t have to be inconvenienced by switch the mode of your seat.I once got the A1 boarding pass on Southwest by upgrading to first class for $40. I got a free glass of champagne in a plastic cup.Infinite curry bar in an enclosed space is riskyMan, I want that life. \n\nHow do I start?:)Your own private cabin with bed and tv is the slickest part. That\u2019s beyond the scope of what is ordinarily considered \u201cfirst class\u201d on most flights, including international. On a flight to Japan, let\u2019s say 12 hours, you could watch a couple of movies and play a couple of video games or just plan your sleep schedule and sleep through half of it at least. Sounds great to me.\"the industry\"?> A private chef cooks you dinner\n\nI have news for you.. all the food is prepared on the ground. I've flown first class multiple times internationally and the food is nothing to write home about. It's better than the rest of the plane, but not by much. It's just presented a lot nicer and there's more of it.It can be cheaper for me to fly to Poland than to drive there given the price of fuel in Germany right now. Here in Europe we have a lot of budget airlines that go a short distance and can charge under 20\u20ac for a one way ticket. Just about where you live that determines it I suppose.Flights to Florida right now for 50-75 bucks. I can't drive there for 75 dollarsTrue. The truly rich teleport!What the fuck did you mean by thisA few of my friends managed to fly to Greece from the UK for \u00a311, so it's not always a rich person's gameNot really. When driving 2500 miles costs as much (if not more) as a plane ticket solo, then you might as well fly.I don\u2019t understand what you mean by this.\n\nDo you really think somehow rich people from Seoul are going to magically drive to New York City?You don't take your private train car?I don't think that applies in the EU \ud83d\ude02Why? Flying is fast.I\u2019d much rather have the latter than the former. All the flashy brand names are just that: flash. Now, something made to last with top quality materials that\u2019s fitted exactly to my body? That\u2019s real luxury.Clothes with huge logos and shit on them is for people who want to think they\u2019re rich.\n\nRich people just want high quality comfortable nice looking clothes. It makes sense.Money talks, wealth whispers. \n\nIf you see someone who\u2019s truly rich, most of the time you won\u2019t notice.LV is brand for sad people.There are plenty of people who have 0 net worth and they are buying LVCoach is not high end.Yep, theres a reason every tech mogul you see wears the same basic gray t shirt. probably feels like the best sleep you've ever had on your bodyPrivate also allows you to fly at any time.\n\nWhen I worked for a large corporation, the c-suite guys would all fly in on the company jet. They'd fly down in the morning, hang out, and then fly out that evening. The flight was 2 hours each way, but because they could fly out whenever they needed, they got a full day in.\n\nAnd HQ was also in a smallish city with a lousy airport that had no direct flights. So the corporate jet saved even more time.Yeah, the value of private jets is convenience. Go where you want when you want in your own terms, be in the air 40 minutes after deciding to go, and bypass the whole airport hullabaloo.\n\nBut there is a best of both worlds: ACJ (Airbus Corporate Jets) and BBJ (Boeing Business Jets). All the convenience of a private jet, plus all the comfort of a large yacht, all in one nice airliner. Also offers much more range. When they set up an airliner to carry 18 people as opposed to 180, you get to use most of the cargo hold for extra fuel tanks.\n\nOnly downside is those things can't land in small airports. You're gonna have to land in Denver and charter a Gulfstream to take you to Aspen.Most private jets fly quite high, even higher than commercial, where there is almost no turbulence.Private jets are smaller but not necessarily more turbulent. They tend to fly higher where there tends to be less variance in weatherI\u2019ll take small and turbulent over \u201cscreaming babies\u201d any dayprivate planes are hella comfortable. they're not turbulent at all lol>but offer privacy, no TSA and no wait\n\nYeah.  Airports are the worst part of flying.Just got to be awake the whole time.Renting a plane on average is around $150-200 an hour with an instructorNo way the pilot seat is better than first class. Better view though.Poor? Definitely. \n\nNicest seat? In the airplanes I've rented you're lucky if all the seats are the same color and don't have questionable stains.I miss my nonrev status, that shit was better than gold.Yep.  I have like 100+ upgrade credits all worthless.  So many people putting in for upgrades that only the highest status get the seats.  I was once the highest status but I am happy to rarely need to fly.  \n\nAlso other than a larger seat with more leg room nothing else about first class is worth it.  Don't need a warm towel thanks.I used to fly actual business jets for wealthy people. One guy was worth billions and would call a yellow cab upon landing every time to save money. The rich don\u2019t get rich by spending I supposeThere is a legitimate point where not spending becomes ridiculous. Jeff Bezos spent $16,000 on parking tickets because walking would require at least an extra 20 minutes both ways for 3 or 4 weeks and that time outweighed expense. It would've cost him more NOT to pay the parking tickets and been more effort. Showing up an hour before takeoff and sitting around waiting to board and get everything set up is a waste of time and at a certain point your time becomes worth more than your money (really nice problem to have). \n\n\"Rich\" is also a vague term, I think anyone making $200k/year is rich but others disagree with me.My Grandpa says, \"you don't want to be the guy who owns the plane, you want to be friends with the guy who owns the plane.\"This guy gets it. The real first class is having people fly to you.One of the richest guys I've ever met (multi millionaire) drove a beige 96 Camry that he bought brand new and lived in a modest, albeit very nice, house on the beach. Flipside of that is one of the brokest people I've met drove, and then lived in, a brand new Mercedes that he was leasing.This!  A lot of incredibly wealthy people live low-keySame, but my rule is 4 hours.....because that's about how long it takes for my back to get mad at me.\n\nAlbeit, I don't have fat guy stories.Yup, thats where I'm at too! My last straw was an overnight flight at the back of the plane next to a large lady who couldn't put her table or armrests down, and I got the aisle seat. Every time someone went past they had to brush by me, so I didn't get much sleep. Also, I'm unusually tall.how much more is it? I don't even look at the other options other than coach when flyingThat just happened to me on my last flight!  I'm pretty small and even trying to squish myself as far away from his seat as possible his body was going into my seat.  Would like to be one of the poorest rich people to have that luxury :)[deleted]\u201cMoney talk, wealth whispers\u201d head assesOr the aviation industry.Was this the flight Ted Cruz took to Cancun in the middle of a winter storm?> Moral of the story is spirit is cheap and you get what you pay for.\n\nI needed to do a quick same day trip, so I figured what the fuck why not just fly Spirit? Never again. Honestly it's not even the service, it's the fucking people that take Spirit that's the biggest turn off. It was a 1 hour flight. It's like a combination of fucking hood rats and people who look like they would show up to an insurrection, to fat greasy mother fuckers. It smelled disgusting, it was ratchet as fuck, and the people are just intolerable.My family thinks I'm nuts for buying business class tickets to NZ. Like, it's my first holiday abroad in 5 years. I'm gonna travel like a king, god damn it!Same. If it\u2019s international or more than 2 hours, I just want to put my legs up. The rest is gravy.As soon as the tray tables are allowed I always pull my bag out from under the seat in front of me and put it where my feet were and put my feet under the seat in front of me. It's a gamechanger in coachAh yes, the extra long legs required to stand tall enough to be *drum roll* Tha_Watcher ^tm -edit- spellingI wish I could just afford the economy seats with extra leg space \ud83e\udd72G fiiiiive for the PECKERAnd the rest don't flyYou say potato, i say Guatemalan Death Pepper.You get to carry on and store your bags while there is still overhead space. Usually on a full flight, the last to board passengers end up having to check a bag. Also, I don't have to wait in the boarding line and smell the rest of you. And a free cocktail before takeoff.They serve booze in first while boarding coach.Super rich people being frugal is just a feel good story for poor people. You\u2019d have an extremely hard time finding someone worth 50+ million in coach and no, saving what amounts to a few pennies is not how they got thereNo one with 50 mil is flying coach. You don't get to 50 mil by making small economies in your spending. You get there by investing your money early in something big.\n\nAnd once you've got 50 mil, you can make a million a year while growing the underlying. A milliona. Year is more than enough to spend on private flights.Tell me\n\nThere's no right nor wrong with the answer though. For some it's this, for others it's thatI sold cars. I had a couple come in and they wore ratty clothes that were clearly old and drove an early 2000's Honda CRV. They spent over 100,000 cash on a new car.\n\nI had plenty of people come in, designer clothes, new BMW and leveraged up to their eyeballs in debt and couldn't get financed for a Bic pen.Lol maybe on a jump commuter flight to \"business\"Truth, but it's also the airlines fault, they've started marketing anything that's better than economy as first unless it's a three class plane. Flew for 5 years  many times a year in business class for work until I saved up enough points to redeem a first class upgrade on a single leg of a trip. Emirates A380, was the only one in first class... First and last time. The ticket otherwise was 13k. Insanity. Meanwhile you have other comments about flying private, I'm not sure I believe.Enh... United calls all the premium cabins on domestic US 757 flights \"First Class\"... even though it's not even as good as international Business Class seats. Alaska Airlines is similar.Or they call it first class because it was business class and there wasn't anything above them. I flew business because it was 'free' to fly on points and they were going to expire so what the heck? Why not?\n\nI can see people claiming 'first class' because they actually flew business and don't care or know the difference.The Seinfeld joke about how it's never any big deal who's in a limo because it's probably just a couple dozen teenagers with $3 each.Inflation man.Growing up we\u2019d always book a limo to go to the airport cause it was cheaper for a family of 4 then taking the shuttle. I believe it actually was $75 total compared to like $20/person for the shuttle.Reading this made me realize how weird it is we associate limos with wealth and extravagance. \n\nSure, we see celebrities and the elite often use them, but it just makes more sense because they often have an entire entourage of people with them. Security, stylists, photographers, friends and family.\n\nInstead, they\u2019re interpreted as a symbol for people to show off their wealth.Party busses would probably work better. Not many limos where I'm from but lots of party buses.\"You can't do anything with five, Greg. Five's a nightmare. The poorest rich person in America. The world's tallest dwarf.\"That\u2019s accurate. There\u2019s a residential lot near me that was sold and is in the final stages of being redeveloped into two >$3m homes. A few weeks ago a white Mercedes Sprinter pulled up outside, which I thought was just your normal tradesman\u2019s van. Then the side door opened and it was like getting a glimpse into a well appointed private jet. I guess that\u2019s how the developer rolls around town to check up on his investments.Limos are definitely passe.. more a 90s rich people thing, I thinkKateYea. He was on one of the late nite talk shows. Leno ?But it makes them happy!I know Europeans super hate gypsies, but this is kind of cute. I don\u2019t really see a problem with it. It\u2019s not like they could use the money for a limo to buy a new bedroom.It shouldn't make you sad. Don't begrudge people of a little extravagance just because they are poor. They are probably much better at valuing the price of fun than most middle & upper class people.Do they like dags?It can be nice to feel specialPart of that is because of handme down culture, so being able to show that it is new is what the sticker is all about. \n\nIf every piece of clothing you've ever had was pre-owned I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing off your new hat you just gotSo my ex was really into snapbacks or whatever they're called, the baseball hats with the flat brims? Sorry, I know nothing about hats or about anything really. \n\nSo one day she's about to put on this new hat she just bought. I reach over and I'm like, 'wait you forgot to take the sticker off!' and proceed to remove said sticker on the brim. Immediately she FREAKS out, grabs the hat before I can destroy her precious sticker, and then tears me a new one in response to my egregious error. She says I'm never allowed to touch her stuff again and gives me the cold shoulder the rest of the day.\n\nNeedless to say, I hate hats and I hate my ex.The Silicon Valley area is sorta like this. The guy in the suit probably rents a studio an hour away from work. The guy with the scraggly beard, jorts, and sandals probably owns a home worth a couple million, rides a bike to work, because he lives a mile or so away, has millions in stock, and drives a Subaru.This blurb gets annoying on Reddit all the time.\n\nMy early career put me around new money, old money and occasional Billion with a B. This idea just a fable that gets spread around as knowledge from person to person, always claiming to be in the know.\n\nThere are wealthy people who live modestly compared to their wealth but they are ultra rare and it\u2019s still very selective.\n\nMy experience is anecdotal but I stubbornly believe it to be far more rigorous than this regurgitated nonsense.People flashing their money are usually flashing all of itI've seen ultra high net worth clients walking around in sweatpants and driving a 15 year old corollaI learned that from a documentary about Warren Buffet and how he drove his old Caddy until it couldn't run, then bought a few years old caddyAre you looking for friends? I am in the market.Can I please get an internship at your dads firm ?What's coach?you fly private as in you have your own private jet? or just rent one? and do you have to go through tsa like the rest of us poors or is there a special security checkpoint you go through instead?I really hope that attitude extends to the way he treats those on whom his wealth depends, and not just the ocassional act of generosity such as the upgrade. I hope he actually pay the interns a _real_ living wage, and pays people the means to not just survive, but to thrive.It\u2019s about convenience, no security, plane leaves when you say, etc. short hall (2-5 hours) can\u2019t be beat by any airline.\n\nFor long haul, airlines are the way to go. Transatlantic private charters can cost $150k one way, just way too much damn money even for the ultra wealthy.Lmao, everyone has their limits. But something tells me he doesn\u2019t spend that much time on the net.We had this businessman in my country that was probably one of the richest guys around.\n\nHe used to walk from his house every morning to a street corner where a guy sells newspapers. He would stand there, read the newspaper, and then go back home.\n\nDidn't want to pay for it.This reminded me of a few tangential country club stories:\n\n* a friend of mine has rich parents. Nowhere close to billionaires but rich. They are members of a local country club for the sole reason that it provides a place for them to moor their yacht. But part of the membership is a monthly \u201cfood and drink minimum\u201d\u2014 basically you have to spend a certain amount of money each quarter at the restaurant. Use it or lose it. I assume this is the only way the restaurant is viable since it\u2019s members only. So anyway at the end of each quarter he\u2019d call me up because they had barely touched their minimum and we\u2019d go down there and get hammered on top shelf for free. Good times.\n\n* when I was in college I worked summers at a different country club. My job was \u201csecurity\u201d\u2014 basically to check people in, look up their membership, etc. plus random odd jobs. One day out of nowhere Bill Gates walks past me on his way out. I\u2019d been there all day and never saw him go in. Turns out he keeps a membership so he can take his boat across the lake and doesn\u2019t have to deal with traffic on the bridge. Someone else drove his car (a very modest car for the richest man in the world at the time, I think it was like an Audi) over and he walked right through the grounds from his boat to the car and disappeared. Only time I ever saw him there.\n\n* at that same place I had a guy pull up and he had his dog in the car. The club didn\u2019t allow dogs and it was summer so he asked me to take the dog to the park down the road while he was in the club. We weren\u2019t allowed to take tips (lol) but he gave me 100 dollars to play with his dog on my lunch break. Pretty sweet deal.\n\n* old lady couldn\u2019t get her car started when she went to leave. She was kind of freaking out and asked me to call \u201csomeone\u201d. It was a super hot day. I offered to take a look (I know nothing about cars) and got it started in 2 seconds. Pretty sure it wasn\u2019t in park but i don\u2019t remember exactly. She slipped me a 50 next time I saw her.\n\n* worst part of the job was my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss who basically ran the place. She was a real stickler! There was a rule that people under 18 couldn\u2019t bring guests but we all kind of looked the other way. Until one day she got a bee in her bonnet and made me go kick a guy and his girlfriend(?) out of the club. The thing that made it really suck was that I knew the guy. He was like 2 years below me in high school. He gave me the whole \u201cugh are you serious\u201d rich kid schpiel as I embarrassed him in front of his lady. It was embarrassing for both of usSuper rich people can be weird as fuck with money. My old boss had a net worth of 100mill+. He would spend 50k on a wine purchase, then he would buy two art pieces for 200k. But that one time his cleaning lady took a 10 minute break on work time, he fired her. Also if he would order let\u2019s say 500\u20ac worth of champagne and the store wouldn\u2019t offer him free shipping, he wouldn\u2019t buy it or buy there againRead up on J Paul Getty. He was a billionaire that would buy expensive rare art, yet did crazy stuff like installing pay phones in his house for guests.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Paul_GettyRumor has it that LeBron refuses to splurge for Spotify premium.Emirates' A380s even have a shower in first class.> Hitting a storm in private ain\u2019t cute.\n\nI\u2019ve been a passenger on a 7 seat jet a whole bunch of times. Even the easy landings make you pray a bit. Rough weather is another story. Several times I was certain that we were all going to die. That little jet would sometimes come in sideways when it landed.\n\nQuite frankly I\u2019d much rather fly first class than private.I agree .. and Qatar Q-suites ( business )is as good as BA first class plus amazing serviceLay flat seats on long flights are so worth it if you have the cash. Completely changes your trip. Not to mention the lounges you get with those tickets.  I must be a poor rich person.Agreed. Almost impossible to go Internationally without Business if its over 7 hours. Besides the business on Airlines such as Qatar (Q suite) is phenomenalHow does this prove anything lolAs someone who has flown on private jets for work, it's astounding how much nicer it is - and how much more work I can get done. \n\nI can be several states away and working on site before I would have taken off from my home airport. Seriously, it's 8 hours of travel vs 1:45. When you factor in time, private charter actually can be justified. Especially if you can divide the cost among a few people.It isn\u2019t a secret. Andy Beal.Buffet is famously known for his low expenses. Drives like a25 year old beater bc cars are such bad investmentsIt used to be common knowledge that Bill Gates flew coach. Until '97 when he was worth $36 billionIn my experience pennypinching is more of a personality trait than a logical response to one's circumstances. Cheapness and spendiness aren't really correlated with poverty and wealth, at least in the people I know.I think its important to note that flying coach has nothing to do with why he's a billionaire. I say this with no additional context and yet I'm reasonably sure of it.Eh. Not as much as you would think.\n\nUp until this year, you could get gold status (lowest) on American for flying 30 segments. Which is 15 trips. However, if you\u2019ve got a flight with a connection, that\u2019s 2 segments right there, so you could easily achieve it in 10 - 12 trips if some of those have connections.\n\nGold let\u2019s you get on the upgrade list, and if you\u2019re traveling to a smaller airport where there might not be as many business travelers, it\u2019s pretty easy to get upgraded.\n\nI\u2019ve flown first class plenty of times just because I travel for work and fly into a lot of smaller airports. But if I ever tried to upgrade flying to Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, etc. I\u2019d be in the 20\u2019s or 30\u2019s on the upgrade list.\n\nEdit: Also the day and time matter. For example, most business travelers/consultants travel Monday morning and home Thursday evening, so you\u2019re most likely not getting upgraded during those times because there are going be plenty of folks with higher status than you.Oh I'm not saying they are poor but they aren't necessarily rich either just because they are sitting in first class.I flew economy from Melbourne to DC 7 times in 12 months, which was enough to get Premier 1k status with United.  This included enough plus points for 4 business class upgrades between Melbourne and LA.  The value of those upgrades was roughly double what I paid for the flights.  Then covid hit and I was stuck in Australia for 2 years.  Only ended up using one upgrade before they expired.  And now United has changed their rules so that's not possible anymore.There are also opportunities for paid upgrades that are significantly cheaper when the cabin isn\u2019t full and the airline sells them for much cheaper than booking directly.Most people in first are consultants or sales people that are flying at least 100,000 miles a year. Before Covid I flew about 75,000 a year and I rarely got upgraded. And yes I\u2019m not poor but I\u2019m not rich either or I wouldn\u2019t be flying all over the US to make money.I\u2019m a social worker, aka very poor. I took a work trip from central Indiana to Memphis Tennessee. Work offered to reimburse my mileage, but I hate driving through heavy traffic, so I took what they would have reimbursed me for driving and applied it towards a plane ticket. Round trip was about $425. For an extra $50 each way I was able to upgrade to first class. I afforded that on a $38,000/year budget. It\u2019s not too hard to get into first class. This was not paid for by the company.  I bought my own ticket and they reimbursed me for what I would have gotten if I drove.[deleted]Poor people don't flyAh I see you started high and it's only been downhill from themI have been in first class exactly 1 time. Cincinnati to Newark during COVID. That's like a 90 minute flight. It was basically just a slightly wider regular seat with a fancy armrest. Didn't get any food/drink either because of COVID. But hey, I flew first class!True, but that's also where you get genuinely rich people flying commercial because their own jet doesn't have the range.\n\nRecently looked at JFK to Tokyo 1st class for shits and giggles. $31,000 per seat, it was mind blowing.I used to get complimentary companion passes on international first class,  whenever I had to travel for work my bf tagged along and we added a weekend to my work trip.\n\nAnyways, I flew a lot for work.Same. I fly maybe about 2 times a year so I figure why not just spend the extra money? The economy seats are basically crushing my pelvis, the extra legroom are significantly better, but I figure why not just pay a little extra for free bags, free drinks, gauranteed overhead bin space, and a significantly more comfortable seat?First class domestic is like $1000.\nFirst class international can be upwards of $30,000 or more.\n\nI think they were wondering how the latter flies that way.Curious, the deal you're asking for is an upgrade to 1st from a seat you already have, right?Those damn poors![Walking through first class makes \"the poor people\" pissed off.](https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-03/study-walking-through-first-class-on-planes-makes-passengers-angry)\n\n> it\u2019s not necessarily a lack of comfort or more time on the tarmac that\u2019s causing passengers to act out; it\u2019s the mere existence of a first-class cabin and the way economy passengers are forced to walk through those coveted rows as they board the plane.I started upgrading my domestic flights to first class after booking because I would run into the same thing. 250 for a flight from iad to jfk. 40 dollars to check a bag. 300 bucks for first class with 2 free checked bags and drinks. It's not a long flight but I find it worth it.Most of those seats are being taken by people that fly every week for work and there are a lot of them. Especially pre-Covid. They\u2019re buying coach tickets and then getting upgraded. I\u2019ve got 1.7 million lifetime miles and all that gets me is the lowest level at AA. And I rarely get upgraded. It\u2019s the folks that fly at least 100,000 a year that are taking those seats. And they\u2019re not paying for 1st except for all those trips to earn those miles.Points can be very good if you know how to use them. You have to look for transfer partner points programs, keep an eye out for double points sales/transfer bonuses, and generally pay attention to the points prices. Sometimes, buying the points to buy the tickets is cheaper than just buying the tickets.Points are indeed a scam if you don\u2019t know how to use them.Was this through American Express Travel?\n\nYou get better bang for your buck if you transfer your points to airline miles and use the miles to book the trips.It\u2019s a game, so you have to be willing to play.  Look into going to Bangkok.  With AMEX points you can transfer to a lot of airline programs that have varying redemption levels, with unique products across all three major alliances and some of the non-allied airlines.  You can find long haul first class (or business) to that city for very reasonable point levels.  Once you\u2019re in BKK, you can generally get anywhere within 3 hours flight time for about $50 one way in coach.  You can also get a lot of status nights to qualify for hotel status in SE Asia, which can be a game changer for perks like free breakfast to offset trip costs (one less meal to pay for) while easily spending under $100 a night for a western brand.  You just have to think bigger than your travel ambitions at the moment.My brother in law owns a business and does well for himself. He travels 4-5 times a year and always flies first class; he uses the points on his card to fly first class (he has a lot of points because of the business). \n\nHe told me he hasn\u2019t paid for a flight in years.He completely pulled that anecdote out of his ass. Most 1st class passengers are just upgraded frequent flyersBusiness travelers are usually pretty easy to spot. They are very at ease in a plane, usually seem to have a routine that they are following, and they often work on a computer on the plane for at least part of the trip. They looks  professional but casual, pack light and efficiently, and don\u2019t have neck pillows, watch movies, or eat lots of snacks.\n\nFirst class is a very expensive way to fly commercial. If a regular seat is $300, first class could be $1500, and private would be $35000. With that in mind, it makes sense that most people who fit that price point are mid to high level consultants or executives. Business owners would rather save their money, vacationers want to spend their money on the vacation part, and family travelers are most often pretty thrifty.\n\nIf you fly a lot, or if you have been a regular business traveler, it\u2019s all pretty intuitive.Probably talking to people on planes.  You meet folks, and figure out that everyone but you is either passing the cost on to the company, or some client. \n\nImportant footnote:. Face to face meetings used to be a much bigger deal than today.Idk about this person but I do know that it\u2019s called \u201cBusiness Class\u201d for a reason, most people in first class are there for business purposes. So if their client isn\u2019t paying for the flight it\u2019s likely their employer is or that it\u2019s just part of their cost of doing business.\n\nIt\u2019s actually been a big issue for airlines. After COVID not as many people are working in office or in the field, there aren\u2019t as many meetings or conferences and so fewer companies are flying people around. The seats for the proletariat don\u2019t actually pay the bills or bring in the money.Gotta check out the first class bathroomCheese first, then you're good to go.Domestic <> international[deleted]European flight prices are wild to me as an American. Berlin and Warsaw are like 600km apart, and looks like tickets are like ~$150ish, probably cheaper if you go further out.\n\nA similarly flight (similar distance, similar size cities) for me in America is $300 minimum, with a few going up to $500. Even going months out it only goes down to $255. \n\nAnd I'm not super experienced with european flights, but I've always had a much better time (from a service/comfort level) on European airlines than American. \n\nI drive a very efficient car, but it would still only cost me ~$50 in gas each way.I'm guessing you haven't checked flight prices recently. 20\u20ac flights aren't a thing anymore. Try flying anywhere in Europe in the next 2 months, all flights are 150-300\u20ac. Maybe if you book a flight in December but then pray it doesn't get cancelled.how often do poor people drive 2500 milesNot if you'll need a car when you get there.  Rental cars can add way more to the price of a trip than the plane tickets.Look at ol moneybags here with a car!\n\nClearly you\u2019ve never been to Rwanda.There's a dude I follow on TikTok(yeah, yeah, I know) who talks about high end brands, coded Luxury, and all that stuff. It's interesting to see the difference between someone with money, and someone with *money*. Everything from clothes, to jewelry, to mundane items can be coded luxury for the ultra wealthy.\n\nEven things like suitcases are involved. Rich people will have the Louis Vuitton or Gucci suitcase sets; whereas the ultra wealthy will own these nondescript sets that are extremely durable, last years and years, and cost thousands of dollars for every individual piece.I would pay extra for clothes with no logos. I hate them, makes me feel like a walking billboard.It was just the first example of \"Higher end\" that came to mind lol. A better example would've been basic Prada or basic Hermes items.This is the real benefit of a business jet. You can\u2019t do meaningful work on a commercial flight, and you are at the whim of others for schedule.  Depending on locations, it may take a full day of travel between connections to arrive somewhere. That means one full work day takes 3 actual days.  Those 2 wasted days more than cover the cost of operating an aircraft.My company does this as well, but the corporate jet isn't just reserved for the C-suite. Anyone can fly it but risks getting bumped with short/no notice if a higher up changes plans last minute (or at any time, really). The cost of operating the jet is typically not much higher than commercial travel on a per seat basis. $500-600 for your typical 3 hour flight, so it's actually encouraged to use the jet when able. The jet also flies its schedule no matter the occupancy, so not using it is straight wasteful.I've done the same thing a few times flying commercial, there and back same day. This was between two major airports. I can get work done on the plane as well, so the time isnt wasted.  If you are TSA pre, and know exactly how long things take, so you can time it tight, flying commercial can be pretty efficient.  But whether commercial or private, it's a long day, I don't recommend it.so from what i see acj is basically a normal passenger plane but converted for private usage?With your point on size it's why the middle size private jets are so popular. Gulfstream G550s, Falcon 900s, ect. All have great range, large cabins, and can land at a lot of airports that a commercial sized jet can't.And leg roomOnly if you don't wanna dieJust taken my first non rev flight. The headphone Jack socket was broken so no movies, the area hadn\u2019t been cleaned properly and I slept through a meal but it was free! I have so many trips planned, it doesn\u2019t seem real!$10,000 for a flight, $50 for a cab. Lol.That\u2019s immaterialParking tickets are just the fees you pay for premium parking.If it was anyone except a Grandpa who said this I would assume they are a gold digger.Same with a boat.But what about travelling to places?Same re: rich acquaintances. Mine drives a beater, takes Amtrak when they can when traveling long distance, lives with his daughter in her basement (and babysits his grandkids), and insists on doing his own painting and plumbing for his rental properties. The guy is in his mid-90\u2019s.\n\nOh, and he\u2019s called me about a sale on X grocery item, on sale, a 3 hour drive away from me, urging me to stock up\u2026\n\nBut hey, the guy clears an absurd amount of money from his pension and investments, and puts it back into our diaspora community as low interest personal loans. I can\u2019t say I like him personally, but I respect his accomplishments and what he does.I about had a panic attack on a flight recently. I had exactly enough room for my knees to be digging into the seat in front of me, even sitting as far back in the seat as I could. The guy next to me was larger (as was I), and the window was placed just wrong enough that it was digging into my shoulder. I was having a bad time. I'm not flying American anymore lol.Had to fly for work on a long haul flight a few times a year on an A380. Economy was ~750, business was ~2500, first class was ~5000+.Around 1.5-3x's as much.\n\nEconomy plus is same width but more leg room and often has a free drink/ check bag, as well.\n\nOr you look at points on a credit card. If you don't overspend put 100% onto a credit card. Gas, groceries, bills, etc and pay it off and then use points for upgrades.\u201cMoney does whatever the fuck it wants\u201d\n- some rich guy reading this quote on RedditIt\u2019s the Walmart of airlines. You\u2019re going to see some shit, and the money you save isn\u2019t worth the horrible experience.It doesn't happen overnight.  Keep at it!  See my username...They use to. Not any more.Dude. Why does Reddit circle jerk this constantly. Can they not do math? A person with 50 million can fly first class till the end of time and a 100ky will not \u201cmake money\u201d by flying economy.  What kind of insane world do the people who keep repeating this all the time.  \n\nYou cannot save your way to wealth.  You can save your way to comfort. That\u2019s about it.\n\nYou have to spend your way to wealth. Or inherit.Eh....it depends on where you're flying.  Maybe short legs.  SFO to Hong Kong, direct without fuel stops is around $500-700k.  I don't think someone paying a million a year is going to pay that.\n\nedit:   These are costs for round trip, not one way.Sure, but what's the point of paying some absurd amount of money to fly from say... Houston to New Orleans, or Dallas to Kansas City?  I imagine even if I was that rich, I'd still fly Southwest because it's such a short flight and not worth upgrading.What would you say the net worth threshold is past which people always fly first class or private?> No one with 50 mil is flying coach.\n\nI am worth more than that, and I only started flying business in very recent years. However, I may be the exception that proves the rule. I have only flown private once, and that was last month so that my rabbit could be in the cabin.I don\u2019t know if you realize but wealthy people rarely pay in cash. That is a late stage retired middle class thing. \n\nThey may appear to pay in cash to you but they wired account leverage.  You just don\u2019t know the difference.\n\nEdit: oh you\u2019re one of those FIRE cultists. Never mind.I rented one of the coolest vintage carriage style limo for my prom... Definitely the most expensive one to show up. \n\n\n$49AUD each, 10 of us, full confectionery bar and soft drink access. \n\n\n\n\n\nDid we only sit in it a total of an hour? Maybe.\n\n\n\nWas it worth it? Yes.High schoolers actually rent limos for prom? I thought that was just a made up Hollywood thing.I was sitting outside a coffee shop downtown when a guy rolls by hanging out of a limo. He points at me and says, hey I know you, and then spreads his arms as in \u201clook, ain\u2019t I tha shit\u201d. I was like \u201cyep, anyone can rent a limo, MIKEY!!\u201dMy cousin and I once helped a limo driver change a driver and he offered to drive us around for a bit as a thank you. We were both dirt broke at the time.Today\u2019s super-powered anti-heroI mean it was 75 yesterday, I raised it to 400 because inflation\u2014ya know.That\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m about 13 miles outside ORD and the train is $5. A few decades ago when I was about 100 miles outside a different metro airport, the bus was $35.For long trips it's cheaper to take a limo or town car to SFO than parking at SFO or an Uber.We did the same thing for when we would goto the bar.\n\nThere was always to many of us for 1 van cab. So we always orderd a limo which ended up costing less than 2 van cabs.\n\nWe ended up knowing one of the limo drivers pretty well and if we gave him enough time he would show up after the bar for us as well.It\u2019s this same perception though that makes you not want to get a limo. You\u2019re out here saving money but you\u2019re afraid other people think you\u2019re a douche who thinks he\u2019s hot shit.Most very wealthy people I know drive nothing really above \"mid-range\" vehicles. \n\nExtravagance these days is a Long-Wheelbase Sedan:\n \nBentley, Maybach, an Alpina 7-Series, AMG S-Class, A8-S and the ilk.If the tailoring is breath taking, you want the stand up van these days. It also prevents feet swelling to stay standing rather than to sit then stand repeatedly imho.It\u2019s like we equate drinking champagne with wealth, whereas (in the UK at least) a decent bottle of champagne will cost you less than 2 packs of cigarettes.Rich people don\u2019t use limos. They use very discreet caravans of vehicles, if they can. They use very obtuse caravans of vehicles if they must.But isn't a limo just a small party bus when you have good friends?Well a Spade is a SpadeAce of[deleted]ICYDK she was married to his brother.  It still blows my mind a little when I remember that fact.As a dad who just blew hundreds of dollars to see my kid super happy seeing one of his favorite shows in-person....

Especially when those clothes are always shitty, cheap garbage made by slave children.\n\nI don't care if anyone knows whether or not my hat is new and I wear pre-owned clothes all the time.I worked around several B\u2019s (a super country club) and many close to B\u2019s. \n\nI find the Reddit meme to be super true. The really ostentatious and obnoxious guests were all visitors of members, not the actual members.  IE the friends of the ultra wealthy. \n\nThe B\u2019s would order whisky and soda and gin and tonic - usually with a favorite, but not super expensive spirit. Famous Grouse was common, for example. They would never complain and tip decently (although not showily large tips). \n\nThe visitors would be ordering complex cocktails with high end spirits and complaining all the time. \n\nThe Reddit thing DEFINITELY held true at that club over many years. It\u2019s maybe not universal, but it\u2019s not flat out wrong either.My corollas 28 years old... maybe ill  be rich one day too thanks for the hope.I honestly don't understand this over the past 20 years. \n\nWe hit the technology era.

They only had a profitable/break even day like, a dozen times.\n\nThe richest guy in town (it was a smaller town, but he probably had a net worth of 10-20 million) would come in every day and order a double espresso then head over to the condiment table and fill up the rest of the cup with the 2 percent milk they had in a small jug (intended for creamer instead of those [little tablespoon cups](https://images.app.goo.gl/hmMPwmwXoTQJhhts9)) and heat it up in the microwave. He essentially made a [Caf\u00e9 au lait](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait) for himself.\n\nThe double espresso was like $2.50 and the caf\u00e9 au lait was like $3.25 or something. I remember it was less than a dollar savings on his part.\n\nSo they had to remove the jug and people needed to request milk if they needed it for their coffee because he was abusing the honor system. He was perturbed after they took away his hack and stopped patronizing the coffee shop out of spite.Sounds like he's just an asshole.Theres a story that used to go around about Ingvar Kamprad (the one who built IKEA). That he used to take soda bottles in the hotelroom fridge, then later when he went out he went to the store, bought new ones and replaced them.Yep, I met a guy and his wife on vacation who cashed in a ridiculous amount of miles to book two first-class Emirates tickets. \n\nHe was a former pilot and loved the idea of a shower on an airplane. However, they only give you seven minutes, but that gets bumped up to 15 if your spouse is in there with you. So his wife read a book in the bathroom while he took a 15-minute shower. \n\nThey both said it was a cool experience, but they would never do it again because it wasn't worth how much it cost.If airport lounges are your thing, look into getting a premium travel credit card. My AmEx Platinum card gets me into a number of different lounge brands. It costs $700/year to carry, but all the random little credits I get more than pay for it, plus the intangible benefits like the lounge access, plus the enormous welcome bonus of points is usually enough for a domestic round trip first class ticket or two. If $700/yr is too steep, the Capital One Venture X and Chase Sapphire Reserve both offer similar levels of lounge access with a significantly lower annual fee (and less credit-based benefits, but that\u2019s to be expected).I flew first class on a trip from the USA to Singapore, 14 hrs to Tokyo and then 8 hrs to Singapore with 3 hrs between flights. The ability to lie down and sleep, and then dine and relax in the first class lounge in Tokyo between flights (they had showers and sleep facilities too) and then lie down and sleep on the subsequent leg was fantastic. Even with the return flight being only 12 hours from Tokyo, we all could have worked the following day if we had to. \n\nWe did a subsequent trip later that year for a follow up contract, and we  only priced coach airfare ($2,000 vs $8,000 each) into that contract. Big mistake. The difference was remarkable. We all got sick from being awake most of the 24 hour flights, sleeping on airport benches and eating from vending machines in Tokyo and sitting upright for 8 hours and then 12 hours. We were all dragging for days afterwards on each end.How do you know someone is a pilot? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you!That's the whole reason a lot of wealthy individuals and corporations have private aircraft. It saves so much time. You can literally drive up to the hangar, get on the aircraft, and go at a ton of smaller airports.https://i.imgur.com/MgiKfm1.pngAt that point you\u2019re just a weird brand.I\u2019m relatively certain most of that is PR team bullshit. It pops up in wealth friendly journals and all over the internet every once in a while when some Berkshire bad press is floating around.\n\nI do press management. Nobody is writing those fluff pieces without a pitch from a PR team. And most of it is impossible to verify beyond \u201coh and here\u2019s three sources you can call (that we\u2019ve already given approved talking points to).\u201d\n\nIts the way the news works.I get upgraded often and I\u2019m silver. Definitely more than half my flights.Ok but I\u2019m guessing for at least 80% of the general population 10 round trip flights takes years, probably a decade or more.I'm delta diamond because of work travel and I get upgraded to first all the time. I'm barely middle class, definitely not rich.You're talking as if 10 is a fairly low amount of flights for a normal person.\n\nI have never been on a plane while it was in the air. Most people I know are in the same spot. A handful fly maybe twice a year. A couple fly four or more times a year.\n\nPrecisely one person I know would reasonably fly ten times in a year.\n\nAnd most of the people I know aren't exactly poor.\n\nIf it isn't incorporated into your job, which is something that does not apply to very many people, flying is very much a rarity for all but the wealthy or those with very strong pressures like family abroad.And a lot of times you get 2 checked bags free. It's sometimes only around $20-40 extra to get first class if you're going to check bags anyways, and it comes with free drinks. It can be well worth it, imho.Not everyone pays for it, but enough people do for that class to exist. They don't make money with the upgrades.in my world a rich person is the person who flies more than like once every few years... funny how perspective worksThe only time I've flown first class was when a company flew me out for an interview and tour. Neat experience, good leg room, too many free drinks. I might consider paying to upgrade if the flight is upwards of 5 or 6 hours, but otherwise probably not.It varies widely by flight and airline. I\u2019ve seen transatlantic flights that are $500 - $600 for coach and $5000 - $6000 for first class.You were likely looking at the private suite tickets which are basically a private room.\n\nInternational first class is most times well under 15k for the long stuff and below 10 for something like nyc ->UK.I just go up to the clerk and ask how much is it to upgrade about an hour before the flight and or checking in with the kiosk i'll hit change seat.    Prices will drop a lot if the flight is about to leave soon and they are not sold.   I fly at least 4 times a month,  this has worked very well for me.\n\nPeople are joking about a bribe,  never tried with an airline,  but I do give at least $20 to the clerk at a hotel I am checking in to.  Seems to work very well with upgrades.why are the poors even allowed to walk through first class? i dont want them near me[deleted]This just seems like a ton of work as opposed to using a 2% cash back credit card and saving the cash to use for travel.gotta have money to make\u2026comfy?Business and First are different classes>the first class bathroom\n\nWith a shower. Must shower in Etihad or Emirates.American domestic flying is weird. A short hop is hundreds of dollars, you get harassed by TSA and the service is poor in general.\n\nThe equivalent short flights in Europe are so much cheaper and security is normally less hassle. Service on the budget airlines is rubbish, but British Airways and others are good and still reasonably cheap. \n\nAlso, what US domestic carriers refer to as \u201cfirst class\u201d is literally just premium economy. European flights tend to have similar options but they\u2019ll cost about \u00a3100 more and be called something like Club Europe (BA). \n\nTo put domestic prices in context, I can go London to LA for \u00a3400-500 if I book far enough in advance. Within Europe, last month, I flew London to Barcelona for \u00a317 return.that's not always true. I live in the bay area and was looking at flights from the bay area to la recently and it's like $60. berlin and warsaw are only 500 km apart btw which is the same as sf to laYeah I suppose the cost of everything has gone up recently. Cheapest I can find is like 50\u20ac now.I went from France to Italy last month, I paid 60\u20ac in total go and backI saw a \u00a326 flight for next week earlier.Literally just paid \u20ac27 for a flight from Greece to Austria. Sure we had to pay a decent amount extra with fees cause of bags but if you went with only a backpack that\u2019s a ~\u20ac50 flight with taxes.Depends heavily on destination and dates, and most of Europe had a bunch of holidays recently so it was dearly expensive.\n\nIt is definitely more expensive than before with flag carriers - in particular Lufthansa. But Ryanair still has plenty of fares under 50\u20ac even for sought-after destinations so as long as you avoid holidays and peak dates (like flying out on a Friday). \n\nBut you definitely have to have way more flexibility to go anywhere on a budget this year. Even if you save on flights hotels are a different deal, and forget about renting a car without paying easily 50\u20ac per day.Took a flight from Germany to Greece today, paid 53\u20ac total to go back and forth.Probably once a year, if even that often.If you're poor it is unlikely you're taking the two weeks off of work to drive that farYeah. But what the commenter failed to say is that a brand new custom one will run you around $150-200 million. It\u2019ll be $300 million for a 777.  A top of the line typical private jet tops at around $90ish million.i fly corporate jets and it\u2019s crazy how people will drop 50k on a one way flight then sit around for an uber to take them home\u2026Places travel to youI stopped flying American when the airplane was so old that the armrests had built in ash trays, and the cabin pressure was so off that my head felt like it was in a vise. Or maybe it was a fume incident? Either way, I got a massive headache and it dissipated right after I got off the plane.Business on international is nice enough that first often isn't worth the increase.  Most airlines don't even do international first anymore.Yea, that\u2019s gonna be a no from me. Economy to business is too big of an increase to justify the extra comfort. Combined with all of the expenses at your destination, that difference is WAY too big to make sense financially. Especially if you have a family and then have to pay it 3+ times. \n\nAnd this is coming from a larger gentleman who makes $150k per year.What did the old ass hit though?  The lottery?I flew American in first two weeks ago and got a gin and tonic during boarding. Don\u2019t know what to tell you.On a 747 filled with hundreds of the finest hookers and coke, maybe. You can buy a fucking private jet for a few million. The fuel for that flight would be less than 3k. \n\nI havent the slightest clue where you pulled that number from. International flights would be impossible at that price. You're off by more than an order of magnitude.In terms of car sales you 'pay cash' which is usually a wire transfer or check or finance which is either through the dealership or a check from a lienholder. We always know the difference between the two because the title is under the lienholder or outright to the buyer.\n\nThey either liquidated stocks, had cash on hand or potentially took out a refi on their house because their investments made more than the home refi cost.\n\nA lot also financed because they did get more in returns than their interest rate cost. They financed at shortest term and took the then 3.5% rate.The memories are worth the money when you're a teenager. Glad you had a good time.Had a group of about 12 of us and I rented a school bus for $75 AUD.\n\nEveryone's rocking up in cool cars and we had a Hermit Park Bus Service bus drop us off.yes, limo rental is cheaper than prom dress rental in some cases.We did a month ago, yeah. It's pretty cheap and a fun experience. Almost everyone had one rented with their mates lolYup. Totally real. \n\nGirl I dated junior year was the daughter of one of the heads of CoachUSA, the bus company. So he had hook ups in the transportation business. \n\nOne of his buddies comped a stretch Escalade Limo for our prom. She was a senior and her dad wanted to make it memorable. So like 16 of us pile into this thing and go to prom. Then after, the driver tells us we have 4 hours to go anywhere we want before we have to be back. We went into the city and took pictures on the lake, on the river, at Wrigley Field, all between like 12-2am. It was awesome. \n\nOn the way home, the guy apparently ran a yellow/red light making the left turn literally at the entrance to her neighborhood. Got pulled over. We heard the cop say the driver smelled like booze (we didn\u2019t notice)  and then asked how many kids were in back. The driver rolls the divider down about 2 inches. I\u2019m sitting right there. He and the cop both look at me and he asks how many of us there are. \u201cUh 8 couples so 16\u201d. I\u2019ll never forget the cops response. \u201cHoly shit son! You have 16 teenagers in here and you\u2019re running red lights?! How fucking stupid are you?\u201d\n\nThe cop then asked if this was the neighborhood we lived in. When we told him we were literally 3-4 blocks from my dates house, he escorted the limo back and then we all went inside and went to sleep while her dad talked to the cop and driver at like 3am. Pretty sure the driver got fired, but it makes for a great Prom limo story.It's better than that. One of my friends booked us a limo to go see the original Pok\u00e9mon movie back in '98!\n\nI mean we were about 10 years old at the time, so naturally it was awesome to us! We watched Star Wars on the tiny TV they had in the limo!\n\nTo add further context, we weren't paying for this out of our hard-earned pocket money, it was his birthday and that's what he had requested.\n\nI think it's still the only occasion I've ever been in a limo to this day.we would get groups of 20-30 and rent a party bus lolNope, more common than you think.A guy I went to high school with didn't want to go to prom. So to be a dick, he reserved the only limo in town six months in advance. The night of prom he had the chauffeur drive him and some friends around while they did shrooms.>My cousin and I once helped a limo driver change a driver \n \nDid you help the driver change to a different driver? Or did he have a golf club that he needed taking back to the store and exchanging?Villain*His name gives him a bad rep, but he's always there for you when your tire is low or you need some emergency party balloons.Has anyone ever noticed that we've never seen Biden and inflation man in the same room?[deleted]Ranjit?That's actually quite funny and should be made into a segment on a raunchy sitcom about single people with moderately disposable income just trying to find love in the Big City.I live near one one of the most expensive neighborhoods in California. If you drive through that area and look in the driveways you will not see Ferrari\u2019s and lambos. It\u2019s Honda\u2019s, Toyota\u2019s Chevys and the occasional Tesla.This is the most LA thing iv heard in a whileThat's because cigarettes are extortionate, not because champagne is cheap.You are correct my guyEssentially though maybe more pompous? We've got lots of party buses that are smaller charter busese. I've seen plenty that fit 12-15 people so they aren't always massive. I'd imagine it probably costs about the same at a 6-8 person limo since they're essentially reskinned school buses but I can't say for sure.call it like it isBaseI\u2019m sure she was joking. She was actually a cool person. She wasn\u2019t born rich and yet built a fashion empire while suffering from intense anxiety and depression. Her life was sadwait, really? \ud83e\udd23Cherished memories>any fucking thing.\n\n\nWe exist then we die. If we are not enjoying our existence then why the fuck do we exchange our time for money?Auntie here who took my niece on a three-night theme park trip for her 15th birthday a couple of weeks ago. \n\nUsed all the money I'd put aside to get myself a PS5. Got an overdraft notice from the bank this morning. But fuck it, the money will be paid back/saved up in months. She's growing up fast, but she'll remember that trip for the rest of her life.You\u2019re a good dadYeah some Europeans HATE gypsies and it\u2019s a complete blind spot.I agree with you but a lot of the people that do this have a different perspective, which the other commenter touched on. If you grow up poor around other poor people, having something even slightly valuable is a big status symbol. You're used to everything being hand me downs so a new hat is a big deal - they're not showing off to middle class people, they're showing off to their peers.Ehh, streetwear is big on vintage clothing and upcycling (its how i make a living). The bigger issue is fast fashion, companies like Fashionova and SHEIN are the ones with slave labor and humongous quantities of waste. Some streetwear definitely falls into the category but not all, there's a current trend of individual creators doing all the production themselves.Same. I grew up in poor neighborhoods and the flashy stuff NEVER appealed to me.I think you missed the point my (wo)man. Was everything you ever owned hand me downs or used? If not, you might not be proud of having something new because it's normal to you. The fact that you have that attitude now is fine but it is shaped by your experiences. For what it's worth, I totally agree and only spend more than I have to when an article of clothing is custom, fair trade, or made of expensive materials. But again, my opinion is not necessarily the prevailing opinion on fashion, of which there are countless.Even over the last 10-15 years. I was driving a Gen 2 or 3 Prius from 2009 until last year when I bought a new Prius, and holy everything is the new car so much nicer. And it's base model; the old Prius, which I bought from my mother like 4 years ago, had all the bells and whistles available at the time.\n\nAnd yes, I bought the exact same car. The old Prius I was driving was 12 years old and had 250K miles on, and probably another few years left. I figured it was worth the $30K investment to know I'll have a really solid car for the next decade at least.[deleted]I would say regular or middle class but not poor people. Went on a flight one time with a 50 year old man who had never flown before. This was a once in a lifetime trip for him. He had only ever gone places by bus before that. Made me so grateful for the experiences I had.International they check on arrival?To the point of obsession sometimes. I dated a girl whose father did *very* well, so cue my surprise when I found the hand soap refilled with water. Gotta get every last drop, I guess!I know a guy who makes 400k a year but only eats rice, meat, veggie bowls from wabba grill. One every day because he lives next to one and he says food is just eating to survive. But this same guy spends thousands on upgrading every other aspect of his life. He got a brand new kitchen and dining room set installed and he never cooks and a brand new car that he never drives since he lives 5 minutes from his food source. He was also one of those nft collectors who got left holding the bag.Almost every rich person I've met has been strung out on pills & fairly fucked in the head.  I've been to thousands of homes in the Portland/West Linn/Lake Oswego area.\n\nTons will refuse to spend a dollar more than necessary for basic cable and maybe the cheapest internet.  But they'll pack their homes full of useless ugly shit they think is exotic.\n\nThe normal ones throw cash around like they don't give AF while having the time of their life with their kids or grandkids.Facts. Whenever work is good and keeps me busy, I'm hardly on here. Sup recession?You are god damn right. Hate the guyAgreed. For work I\u2019d demand it or extra days built in each way for recovery. I don\u2019t travel internationally for business so it\u2019s the occasional vacation for me. I\u2019d rather not waste my first few days of vacation feeling terrible. The extra money is worth it to really enjoy myself. I have noticed crazy 1st/business class prices. I shop around and plan my trip when I can get a decent rate. It\u2019s worth a few thousand but not 10k. There comes a point when it is just too much. My last trip to Europe we had upgraded the way there and figured we could be miserable coming home (although had booked premium economy) and then crash. I started to really regret not upgrading coming home and it was 10k a ticket at that point. When checking in we could upgrade for $550 a person! Grabbed that so fast.Once your money (personal or business) reaches a certain point, you can buy more of anything that you need... except time.  So things that save you time drastically go up in value.Yep. \n\nI remember my sociology class bashing private jets in college... \"look how many jets company xyz has! Isn't that excessive!\"\n\nNow, I I wonder why we don't have more private jets, TBH. Ours are always booked.He's a bit of a weird dude, so, yeahI have been upgraded for almost no reason at all. First time I as 12 and traveling internationally. I guess there was some sort of typo and my ticket instead said \u201cDr. impulseCombustion\u201d so my seat was changed to the rad upstairs spot. My mom was not pleased and made me sit with them.Is this for intercontinental flights? An upgrade to first or business on a flight from the US to Europe or Asia is a whole different ballpark than the upgrades you get for flights inside the US.Im 30 and Ive been on a plane less than 10 times total lol.Depends if you had to travel for work. Less of a deal these daysAren't we talking about how easy it is to get upgraded? I think folks who are flying less than 10 flights per year aren't expecting to be upgraded ever.\n\nBut yeah that's wild to think about how different some of our lives are on this dimension. I'll have 6 flights just in June and this is a pretty light travel schedule compared to pre covid.In the 90s I flew for business every week. I was top tier with US Airlines,  Continental, Marriott and Hilton. I came to expect the first class upgrade and the concierge level room at the hotel with turn down service. This ruined coach class and budget hotel stays for me.\n\nYes I was diva, but I spent 200+ nights in hotels every year. The perks made it bearable.[deleted]Because of work travel. No poors paying there own way thereI used to work for an airline. The proportion of revenue they get from their most profitable (loyal) customers is insane. Those are the people most likely to buy the expensive last-minute tickets all the time. Even if they aren't necessarily buying first class tickets (which, they can be) there is value to the company in having that carrot on a stick to encourage customer loyalty by offering upgrades.Every flight I've been on has had a packed first class. I fly only a couple times a year but still, have never seen empty seats in first class. There's definitely a market for it.If you wait until last minute, like while you\u2019re sitting in the terminal, it can be less than 100 bucks to upgrade through the appThat could actually be a good differentiator in the United States for middle class - can you afford to take a vacation requiring airfare at least annually.I've flown first class on 14 hour flights because I was dating a flight attendant. Being able to sleep nullifies a lot of that time, to the point where I would never pay for it. Like paying thousands of dollars for an upgrade to a shitty motel.On some international airlines first class is that over the top thing and what most think of as first class is business class.I paid $3500 per person for round trip 12hr flights to Rome for business class. Got them super early\n\nWhen we flew, prices were $9000 each.\n\nI splurged on honeymoon. No regrets what so ever.Most planes are 2 classes. Busomess/first and economy. \n\nYou usually need to go international to get. A true 3 class plane.On Etihad if you fly on their new Airbuses, they have a singular \u201cseat\u201d on each of those planes called the \u201cResidence\u201d, which is literally just a sky apartment. You have your private first class suite with a reclining chair, huge TV, the usual, plus a **literal bedroom** with an actual full size mattress AND your own *private* bathroom with shower.Only trouble with those low cost flights is they charge on top for anything and everything they can. With that said it's still a great deal and I love it.\n\nCosts me \u00a390 to get to London from where I live on the train, but I can fly to most places in Europe for half that. Very cool, and I don't think people sometimes realise how lucky we are to have that serviceThere's also like 100 daily flights between the two cities so it's extremely competitive, not counting flights between secondary airports like OAK and SNA/LGB/BUR/ONT. \n\nIt's the same on the east coast between the major cities.\n\nA better comparison would be Bay Area and Reno or Boise.Well summerI flew estonia to Liverpool for 12\u20ac return last month, it's definitely still possibleAnd that's just buying it, which is the cheap part. People have no idea just how thirsty those fuckers are, and the maintenance and crew...some newer planes still have those ashtraysWe just barely had a fun time with AA and decided to stop flying with them.\nLeave from Vegas after 2 flight cancellations and a delay, arrive in friggin North Carolina, goal was Maine. Wait 3 hours for the next plane, only to get on and find they double booked our seats, eventually worked out though. Finnally arrive in Maine, our luggage is in Boston. \nReturn flight gets boarded early, nearly miss it, dont have space for our carry ons, have to check them.\nDid I mention we had a family of many children here? We had reserved seats togeather, payed extra for em, we didnt get them or a refund.\n\nFuck AA.Srsly Reddit is out of touch. Also make well into the 6 figures and I\u2019d rather save $4k and be slightly stiffer upon arrival than upgrade to Business Class when I fly US > UK. \n\nYou\u2019re talking upwards of $10k for a couple flying at peak times. For a combined 14 hours of flying. \n\nIt\u2019s a status symbol. Period. 90% of the people in first/business are either not paying themselves, or they can\u2019t actually afford it.I wish.  With lots of risk, you can achieve lots of rewards.  I own my own business.Maybe it\u2019s just United.By an order of magnitude? They are high, but not absurdly so. EvoJets quotes $340k for non-stop with a Gulfstream G650 from SFO-HKG. Other estimates of $10-15k per hour for an Ultra Long Range (which is required for that distance) so $150-225kMeanwhile I tried saying to my parents that, nope still turning up in a dusty GolfHello Townsvillian.So just take a limo and show up naked?\n\nGot you.Limos don't have stripper poles. Party bus gets judged for different reasons. \n\nI'm a fan of the party bus.Willing to bet they mean \u201ctire\u201d.And just like literal comic book villains, to those he helps (e.g. the super wealthy), he\u2019s the heroYea I remember that time he pumped up Mr. Fantastic into a \"Get Well Soon\" balloon for Galactus. [After Galactus had got an upset stomach from eating the planet Prihuvia.](https://youtu.be/LEC_lkpD3rM)True (ish - champagne is heavily taxed as well, although maybe not as much). Either way, that doesn\u2019t alter what I said, though. You never hear people saying \u201cJeremy\u2019s a cigarette socialist\u201d or look at someone smoking a Marlboro and think \u201che must be minted\u201d. It was the perception I was referring to.I saw the signShe was totally joking because she was actually David Spade. Kate Spade did make a limousine purse that is ironically selling for $400 right now.Thanks. The kid was happy, my wife and I agreed there was no better way to spend the money.I love how Europeans will talk about how racist America is and in the next breath talk about how much they hate gypsies.\n\nEdit: the replies to this comment are just -chef's kiss-And the Roma typically prefer to be called Roma, not the slur.I get your point, but in 2022, some plane routes are cheaper than an inter-state bus ticket. Or if you live in a big state like Texas, it's even cheaper than an inter-city bus ticket. No kidding.Yeah there\u2019s no getting around customs reallySafety check at depart is for safety of plane and people. Customs are for safety of country.\n\nIn short.Years ago I had a conversation with a buddy that started with \"do you think Bill Gates fills his hand soap with water?\" We surmised that maybe he does it to feel normal.>He got a brand new kitchen and dining room set installed and he never cooks and a brand new car that he never drives\n\nHe'll earn more by upgrading the property and selling it and the untouched vintage vehicle at a premium.As someone whose not a foodie and have a very picky sense of taste, preferring basic shit - I'd probably be like this. I don't think I'll ever be too rich for pizza and pop tarts (not together obviously) and just completely lack the desire for exotic stuff or even steak. I'd upgrade everything else in my life too but I genuinely enjoy what I eat now and not just because \"it's what I can afford\" granted I usually buy the better quality versions of what little I do want to eat but really the only difference I'd be making is getting certain things I consider a once or twice a week treat as a daily one (and eating out more... and actually paying for delivery instead of getting it myself to save a few dollars).How have you been to thousands of these homes?This would be one of my favourite things about being rich. Not the shit I could buy (granted I'd definitely upgrade my everything) but the time I could save. I only get so many years on this earth and like the majority of people I have to waste so much of them doing tedious bullshit just to maintain any standard of living that isn't terrible.\n\nSitting in traffic. Waiting in line. Going to work. Choosing the cheapest postage option instead of the fastest. Mowing my own lawn. Washing my own car. Going to the shops for groceries. Tidying my own home. Even checking my own e-mails is a daily chore now. I'd outsource as much of the boring bits of my life as I could.Because currently jet prices are high. We're doing so much retrofit work right getting interiors upgraded it's unreal. What used to be not worth the upgrade suddenly is.I mean, yeah, Warren Buffett loves to get a regular McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger and a cherry coke. But does he really fly coach? That shit is uncomfortable.With a name like that they may have just wanted to keep an eye on the 12yo super villian.One time, my spouse and I were late checking in, and we got bumped off of our next flight. The only alternative they could put us on... Only had vacant seats in biz class. We flew from Taipei to Vancouver in pure luxury haha. We'll never get that lucky again.I'm guessing it's flights within the US.\n\nOn the airlines I fly on regularly, it's almost impossible to get free upgrades to first class on intercontinental flights.US domestic First Class is worse than most airlines basic Buisness Class. And it is nothing like an international First class with a major from outside of the US.If the commenter is referring to American, you can't even get on the upgrade list as Silver (not sure how to strike through Silver, I have been corrected, AA starts at Gold).  I was Gold, earned a bunch of 500 mile upgrades, changed jobs, lost Gold status.  After a few flights at Silver (again no Silver, just no status) I was wondering why I wasn't seeing the option to upgrade.  Contacted American and was told I had to be Gold to use the upgrades I had already earned.\n\nEdit: and as another commenter mentioned smaller airports are easier to get upgrades, it depends an the plane.  Smaller airports have smaller planes, some of which don't have first class.Late 20s. Never been on a plane.I know the feeling very well. How often did someone say to you \"oh you get to travel! That must be cool!\"?Yeah, I only book out max two weeks in advance so my tickets for short flights end up being $700-800 for flying in Premium Economy. I fly on busy routes at popular times so $$$. Just the Allentown to Atlanta leg is almost $300 one way.Generally, the eligible frequent flyers are upgraded before boardingThe difference between first class and economy class is *huge*. The extra legroom and lumbar support basically makes the money worth it. But it depends on the travel distance. Short flights (<2 hours) aren't worth it but international flights (easily >6 hours) are great.Last month I was able to upgrade from economy to 1st on a cross country flight for $46 about an hour before the flight.  It was gloriousYeah, if the seat would stay unused otherwise, but that's not the reason they have that class.Without my airline card, i wouldn't be able to. I can usually get 750.00 a year in airline tickets to go somewhere.Yep, airlines realized years ago that First class isn't as profitable per unit area as Business class. Thus First class has been phased out for the majority of airlines to the point where you really only see it for those long-haul routes where someone might splurge. (I almost wonder how much of Lufthansa's First class is being kept afloat by their rubber duckies)\n\nTake a look at United's Newark to London service on its 767s:\n\nhttps://media.united.com/images/Media%20Database/SDL/Travel/inflight/aircraft/767_300er/767_300_46_121_V3.gif\n\nNotice how about 60% of the plane is Business class. Obviously the NYC area to London is one of the biggest business routes, thus the high proportion. What you don't see is a single First class seat. There is still Economy and Premium Economy (called Premium Plus for their international routes; Economy Plus is just a higher price for a better seat location in Economy so no real difference there), but those can almost be considered filler since the vast majority of revenue from the flight comes from the Business class.You know what's really wild about America? I live on an Amtrack line (passenger train transport throughout America, at least partially owned by the US Govt), and yet tickets are about as expensive if not more expensive than plane ticket. \n\nI can usually get a bus for cheaper, but anything over a hundred or so miles and you're going to have a bad time.i know you guys just triggered that man LOL.So it's like owning a boat, but even more expensiveI've had a successful tech career (so far), I never really had the mind for owning my own business.  I think I'm too risk averse, but I'm really glad to hear you've had success at it!Yeah - $700k was for round trip, which Evo would line up with.  For the lower prices, even when you adjust them for round trip, that's $300-450k range which is still insanely high compared to commercial.\n\nMe?  In this hypothetical world, I'd rather pay $15-20k per ticket and travel 10x as much.  Someone with that kinda money would have HUGE CC spend and probably enough points to not even have to pay for some of these first class tickets.My brother and his mates wanted to turn up in my first car, a clapped Peugeot 106. Dinner suits and a crap car.Volkswagen Golfs are dope though (at least here in the U.S. anyway.)Dicks out for Harambe and prom dates.Only because the menthol cigs got banned a while ago. It used to be minted but they put a stop to that.And it opened up my eyes\"but it's *different*\"Europeans can be much more overtly racist. Look at what happens at soccer gamesVery few Europeans hate people of Romany descent. Lots of Europeans hate Caravan Utilising Nomadic Thieves. The travelling community like to claim they are a race for the protections that gives, but really it's a lifestyle choice with people from a huge variety of different origins. \n\nJudging people based on how they act and the company they keep is very different from judging people based on the colour of their skin.If it helps most americans do not know it is a slur. To us it is mostly evocative of a camp of travelers that would be fun to spend a night hanging out with due to media potrayals. Probably not better, and we've recently become cognizant of it, like innuit.\n\n(edit: Inuit)Is it roma or romani? I've heard romani more oftenThis is why I always think it's ridiculous when someone says \"well you have the same 24 hours in a day as [ insert rich celebrity or business person]\". Like I very much objectively don't have the same amount of time to use on my career or art projects or any sort of personal projects or aspirations. I have to spend a lot of my time doing things rich people can outsource or just don't have to do.No he has a plane or did when he was traveling a tonYou got insanely lucky too, because normally they would just take folks with status out of economy, give them the free upgrade, and give you their seat.I had that happen once. Except it was Miami to Orlando so only like 30 min in the air.All the time. Also, the first thing my wife would want to do when I got home was go out to eat when I had just had 15 to 20 straight restaurant meals and craved home cooked comfort food.I used to fly last minute all the time, I paid $900 to go to Nashville from Orlando and $2400 to go to London. Man I miss flying for work.In case that wasn't clear to anyone, many people in first class didn't pay for that premium. They bought a regular economy seat and were upgraded using accumulated frequent flyer benefits based on their relative importance to the airline (frequency of flights, money spent, etc). Or they didn't even pay for the economy seat and just bought the first class seat using accumulated miles.Did you manage that through the app, or did you go to an attendant at the counter?This is brilliant. Thank you.\n\nI never thought about how different routes would garner different plane configurations. It makes perfect sense but it never crossed my mind. I feel enlightened.I mean it is not more expensive is your boat is $150-300M. It is more expensive if your boat is less expensive. Boats are insanely expensive to own. Especially superyachts. One gas fill-up on a 350 foot yacht can cost upwards of $750,000Here in the UK they\u2019re a dime a dozenMuch like Indian/Native American, the term Gypsy comes from the impression that they originated in Egypt (India in the case of Native Americans... Can't believe that stuck)\n\nBut yeah, centuries of baggage kinda makes the innocuous origin moot, if it's been used as a slur for 300 years... Yeah it's probably a slur.Do confirm for me, Inuit is the preferred term for the sub-groups living in north North-America, replacing the idea that any northern native is lumped under Eskimos?I think he owns/owned a private jet charter company! No way that dude flys coachThrough the AA app.  I just opened it up to check something and there was a banner at the top with the offer.These numbers make me feel dizzy[deleted]I'm Inuk, from Nunavut. Inuit or Inuk(singular) is the correct term, but I've never really heard someone use Eskimo in a derogatory manner, if people do go that route it's usually \"fuckin native\".\n\nIt's hella irritating being at parties or seeing people post online with these interjections that \"eskimo\" is a derogatory term, and THEY prefer to be called inuit. Honestly it's like no one consulted actual inuit people on this and someone just read the etymology of the word Eskimo and decided to champion our behalf, which frankly, is patronizing. \n\nI'm fairly white presenting and have had people tell me to my face that inuit people don't like the word Eskimo as if it's this huge deal and it's so out of touch. I thank you for actually asking. My family and friends will routinely tease one another for not being a real Eskimo if they complain about the cold, or call a southerner whos made the North their home pretty much Eskimo themselves as a term of endearment.\n\nMy mom's of the opinion the only inuit who are concerned about the word Eskimo were probably raised down south by white parents (which is harsh but I thanks it's hilarious).\n\nSo yeah, Inuit or Inuk is correct, and also please avoid the whole \"Eskimo is derogatory spiel\", it's pretty out of whack.Correct, as far as I know. I belive inuit is specific so maybe not inclusive of all north american northern most natives (Some Alaskan are Yupik(sp) i think), but I'm not sure. I do know Eskimo is considered a not great label for any groupI\u2019ve done that. They gave me tons of wine, I chose my snacks from a giant basket and I was the very first person off the plane. It was magnificent.Thats absolutely hilarious, and took me into a very informative rabbit hole.\n\nAll we need now are Romans who were mistakenly called Americans or something to round things out.That is very similar to how I feel about the term \"LatinX\". Like, self identifying like that is fine, but don't decide that the grammar of an entire language doesn't matter and apply your white American grammar rules to those of a COMPLETELY different country/language.\n\nBut people get mad at me like I'm trying to erase my trans brothers and sisters and not about the white savior complex that washes over everything it touches.>My family and friends will routinely tease one another for not being a real Eskimo if they complain about the cold\n\nThat sounds so wholesome and funnyI did that with Alaska Airlines and hit the lounge about 2 hours and was so drunk by the time I got on the plane that I don\u2019t even remember the flight, just the landing.",

Way better than doing them alone.I don't know about anybody else but I keep my place clean to help stave off the looming depression...A clean environment to chill in is really nice.It\u2019s easier to keep the house *straightened/tidied*. If friends are coming over, clean anything that stands out as being dirty. If they\u2019re coming over on short or no notice, they\u2019ll have to overlook uncleanliness. At least that\u2019s my policy. (My rather spontaneous-minded friends show up on short notice at least once a week).I think the real gauge is how clean your house is AFTER they leave. The real homies help clean up and keep the place clean.The more important someone is, the more I want them to feel comfortable because the environment is clean. \n\nSometimes I go to someone's house and it feels like there is no space for me and I'm afraid to touch things because everything is dirty. I don't want my friends to feel that way. \n\nI might be a cultural thing, but in my family it shows you are so important to me that I cleaned everything up for you.There\u2019s an old saying, the people that matter don\u2019t mind and the people that mind don\u2019t matter. \n\nPersonally I like to keep my house in a stated of lived in, there may be dishes on the sink but there won\u2019t be sticky stuff on floor.I clean my place before my friends come over because I respect them.\n\nWho wants to hang out at a dirty place?I feel like this could be interpreted in two ways. \n\nEither your friends don't care about any mess and you're tight.\n\nOr you care enough to clean the place to give your friends a clean and more chill place to chill at, on a chill night while it's chilly out.\n\nEdited: typoI\u2019m a person with depression and naturally I have friends with depression. Sometimes I\u2019ll go over or have friends over just so we can help clean up each other\u2019s depression nests before we can chill and hangoutOr you can have friends that helps you clean up your place because you have the largest place with the most parking.I use the incoming visit as motivation to start tidying up. I'm known to be untidy due to ADHD, but I've really been trying.If you have to clean it they judge you too much and aren\u2019t good friends, or you clean to please them because they are good friends?I wish my wife felt this way. No matter who comes over she gets manic and cleans like crazy. Even friends who\u2019s houses are messy come to visit she\u2019s gotta clean like we\u2019re about to perform surgery.I clean my house because I respect my friends and want them to have a good time in a clean environment. No one wants to party in a dump.I realised it\u2019s not about how relationships are, it\u2019s my own anxiety.\n\nIt has not been an easy ride, but one day I decided to practice and stop deep cleaning just because people are coming over. I can do some basic tidy up to provide sitting space, safe walking space,snacks & beverage, reasonably clean wash room. That\u2019s it! I will do the rest whenever I feel like, not whenever people are about to come over.\n\nGrowing up raised by emotional immature parents, I became a people pleaser, over thinker, surviving on walking around eggshells.\n\nAfter I left home to study & work, and sought professional help surrounding mental health\u2026I learned to own a voice with respect, learn to create & protecting my own boundaries without being rude. People who choose to judge without being constructive & respect, continue to not communicate their feelings after my rejections, and continue to choose a narrative that doesn\u2019t fit reality & truth, then they aren\u2019t meant to be in my life.My cleaning hack is if you see it, do it, right then. But ONLY do that *one* task (unless you have the time, energy, and inclination to do more, that is)\n\nExamples:\n\nStep out the shower and notice the bathroom window sill is dusty? Wipe it down there and then. Don't worry if the rest of the bathroom is also overdue for doing\n\nGrab the toaster out the cupboard and notice crumbs on the shelf? Wipe that shelf down there and then. It doesn't matter if the rest of the pantry is also overdue for sorting out and cleaning\n\nTaking food out the microwave and notice the outside is covered in greasy fingerprints? Wipe down the door, don't stress that the inside also needs doing.\n\nI find this helps by getting around your depression or chronic illness by just doing *something.* You get to feel better right away. Maybe you'll feel inspired to do more. Maybe not. And that's okay too.\n\nIt also lets you give yourself permission to halfass things rather than get so overwhelmed by the size of the job that you don't start at all.\n\n[Bonus tip, I also keep a dust buster on the kitchen counter (out of sight, out of mind) so I can grab it and quickly suck up that dust bunny, or breadcrumbs on the floor etc, without having to stress about dragging the vacuum out, and then feeling obligated to vacuum the whole house]Are bugs friends? \n\nLol jk, I try to maintain some clean just so I can make myself sit down and stop doing chores and if someone needs to poo I don't want them to feel gross in my bathroom etc. \n\nBut no one comes here anyway so it really doesn't matter.. my only friends that have stopped by are confused when I apologize for the mess and I realize it's not so bad after all when I look around. I don't think it's clean but they seem to lolClearly my mom doesn\u2019t think our own family are close enough to leave any sort of mess around.There is an inverted bell curve for me.\n\nClean it well for newer friends. Don't care too much for people I have known a bit. But my oldest and dearest friends I want it clean for them.\n\nNo logic or reason.It's a bell curve. Don't care about them, don't clean for them. Care about them and what they think, clean for them. Love them and willing to open up my true self, don't clean for them.Every time my best friend is coming over I make sure I cleanup the house because I respect him.\n\nI don't think just because the friendship is close it means that you can invite people over to a dirty house.\u201cI am here to visit you, not see your house\u201d my standard response to awkward home situations.We must be awfully close then; not my house because I live with my parents,  but my room is always a mess when my best friend is around. Even early on in our friendshipI always clean my house when guests come over. I don't like going to somebody's house and it smells like garbage or there's stuff everywhere / on things. Not disgusted by it or anything, but it's just a bad sight to see. Figure it might effect other people so I clean the place up as well.I have one friend who I let see my house when it\u2019s messy. Unfortunately, she and I have really drifted apart over the last year. Pretty sure I honestly just don\u2019t have any close friends any more. :(I am a horrible housekeeper. I put it off way too long. My sister is coming tomorrow to replace my brake pads. Kitchen, bath and living rooms are now clean after a 2 day blitz. I'm exhausted.  \n  \nIt's not that I want to make the place clean *for her*, she's just so fucking judgey.A friend will bail you out of jail. A real friend will help you bury the body.If it doesn't need to be clean for your real good friends, than sure.I would say the real gauge is how long before you can't wait for them to leave....if you need to clean way too much then you aint that close..  \nmy best friend (RIP) and I comes and goes each other's house anytime, any day.. no need to clean..And how long you can comfortably sit in silence, or not speak for months or years and then be absolutely normal when you meet up (apart from any initial hugs and tears of joy)Cleaning your house is a matter of self respect, not friendship. \n\nPeople who have high self respect, will clean regardless. People who have none, they will leave in mess regardless who comes. \n\nPeople who clean only in specific cases -> they don't want to lose respect from those visitors.ITT: unsolicited advice from self-important redditors\n\nIt's a fucking *wasteland* in here, if you're reading this get out while you canUnpopular opinion, but i always clean up before even having my best friends over. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable having anyone in my home (even like a maintenance man) if there was stuff, dirty dishes, clothes, everywhere.My house is a mess, but nothing is actually dirty, just messy.\n\nBut it still took me a while to let my mum into my house.And how much of a jerk someone based on how bad they make you feel about itYeah I don't care and the people I relate with don't either.  It depends how you grew up and not one way is the right way or a gauge of friendship.Damn, I guess im best friends with everyone. I don't clean my house for anyoneHow filthy do you animals let your homes get? Do the dishes at the end of the day. Put your laundry in a bin. Take out the trash when the can is full. Change your sheets every week.The real gauge of friendship is how much time they wait after your father\u2019s funeral to bang your momMy Platonic Life Partner has come to pet sit when our Apt was a biohazard.  I feel this statement in my bones.My husband's best friend popped in all the time and often picked up the broom or started wiping down surfaces without being asked. Miss having him aroundMy friends tidy my house while they are here. I have young kids, they are mostly childfree.\n\nThey are awesomeIn that case, anyone can be my friend, any time.\n\n(my house is a mess constantly)well im either bffs with every person in existence or mortal enemies..i cant tell whichI always tidy my house for guests. It\u2019s more for me than them though  I want to enjoy chilling without having nagging thoughts about my house being a mess .Seeing most comments I realise I'm different - I don't bother if I barely know someone because I don't care, for close friends though I clean and make sure everything feels nice and I have something surprisingly good to offer etcClean before my firiends come over? For whatever what for? If we aint having a party they're dealing with it \ud83d\ude05 but for serious I'm finally coming through a severe depression and my apartment was definitely a physical manifestation of my mental illness. They supported me through the entire thing \ud83e\udd7aWas a messy for a while. Still had a bunch of friends come over as long as it wasn\u2019t smelly. Love that I know I have these friendsI\u2019m confused. I spend more time cleaning cuz the persons opinion matters more? Or less time cleaning cuz friend is like family and everyone is super comfortable?Just so we're clear...the messier your house can be before the friend comes over, the better the friendship, because that means you don't need to make a good impression, they know you well enough.\n\nNow of course overall it's better to keep your place tidy and clean, and nobody likes to step in a filthy place. But once basic hygiene is reached, if there's a T-shirt on the chair, there's a T-shirt on the chair and a good friend won't care.No matter how close I am to someone, I'd want my place to be clean and welcoming.Correction: \"the real gauge of HOW YOU PERCEIVE friendship is how clean your house needs to be before they can come over\"I always sneak my best friend into my bedroom and it's always messy af. First time it happened he was so relieved that he wasn't the only one with a trashy bedroom LOLNah, the real gauge is WHY you clean up. If you clean up because you want them to feel welcome, or if you feel like you have to clean up to not receive any shit from them.That's more of a gauge of how you want to be seen than genuine friendship. I don't care if someone is my best friend or an acquaintance - my house will be clean.Alternatively, how much one of you guys can get hurt with the other one still making fun of it.Clean for good impression < messy coz they're good friends < clean so they won't get hurt stepping on legosY\u2019know some people just kinda have a clean house all the time. I don\u2019t but I\u2019ve heard tell of these peopleAs I've gotten older (36 now), my house is always tidy. The problem is finding that perfect 1 hour slot where you and your friend are both available xDi think there needs to be a differentiation between clean and tidy. no matter how good your friendship, someone else's dirt is always gross.Hey, need you to come help me clean this place up, got new friends coming over.Make friends with good principles, not superficial things you have in common.Before my best friend passed away, I used to help her clean up the house, and vice versaMy sister has a really good saying for this \u2014 \u201cif you tidy up before I come, I feel like company. If you don\u2019t, I feel like your sister.\u201d  Works for close, good friends tooAs someone without EFD, I want a sign that says \"If you come to see me, come anytime.  If you come to see my house, make an appointment.\" lolMy house needs to be clean before anyone comes over. The real gauge is if I change out of my pjs.Idgaf, you can get to know me better by seeing my squalor. \n\nUnless it's a woman, in which case you could see your reflection on the counters and eat off the floor.This is my number one recommendation for making mom-friends. Find one whose house is of similar cleanliness. Then you don\u2019t constantly stress, OR decline visits because you\u2019re not prepared. My mom-bff and I are both adhd moms and appreciate we can make last-minute plans without any pressure on the house.Reading this on my cleaning break before friends come over to watch the playoffs. Oh boiomg i swear, i had a guy comin over for a date n i cleaned everything spotless \ud83d\ude02friends tho, nah i seen their pigstySo true, but I hate having a messy house.  That\u2019s why I never invite anyone over.Meh maybe for some people but this is not a guage for me. Keep the house semi clean all the time. Never totally clean but not a total mess eitherNah, I hate I\u2019m having a messy/dirty house when I have guests no matter who it is. I get stressed out myself if my space is too messy.Get rid of all the clutter on the way. Makes life much easier.Does anyone else start cleaning the entire house when they lose anything? Like surely it'll turn up during my cleaning journey, plus the house gets clean.I have a slight cleaning OCD. I just keep my place clean always, it makes me feel better about myself and life in general.In Italy they say the same about wine. If you're a guest at someone's house and they pour you a glass of wine from a bottle they already opened the day before, you know they must consider you a really close and trusted friend \ud83d\ude42Any real friends don't care about if your house is messy or not. Either way you should keep your house clean regardless.Im pretty much the opposite, I\u2019m a guy and a horrible housekeeper so I really don\u2019t care how my house looks for anyone. My wife is the exact opposite and doesn\u2019t like anyone coming over if they can\u2019t eat off the floors.A real friend doesn\u2019t care or judge the cleanliness of your house.\n\nEspecially if you or they are a guy.Well I still haven\u2019t cleaned the blood off my wall from 3 years ago, so I\u2019d say pretty good friends.I wouldn\u2019t let the police in unless my house was spotless. I wouldn\u2019t let my clone in unless my house was spotless. I wouldn\u2019t let a draft in unless my house was spotless. There\u2019s clearly some personal quirks at work here.This is an inverse relationship. The less you feel the need to clean prior to them coming the more comfortable you are with them and I assume the opposite as well.Actually it's the opposite. You want your house to be clean when you invite random people, because you don't want them to criticize you and also to have a good first impression.\n\nBut when inviting a close friend, it doesn't matter wether you clean or not clean your house because a true friend don't give a fuck about small details.people be saying:\nnormalize being you and dirty and having no sense of cleanliness, it's the real you \n\nbruhI was trying to explain this at Christmas this year - if you mother fuckers come to my house, it\u2019s gonna be as clean as I\u2019m comfortable with. You don\u2019t like it? Stay home.\n\nI\u2019m not a slob by any means, but my mom was cleaning out the ***pantry***, and my cousins were talking about cleaning their ****upstairs bathroom*** - wtf, guys, it\u2019s ***your house***. You live here - it\u2019s gonna be lived in. And for fuck\u2019s sake, don\u2019t clean shit no one\u2019s even going to see!Neighbors I\u2019m not close with and coworkers and the lot can come to my house when it\u2019s messy. I clean up for the friends who are important to me.I keep my room clean most of the time. Just because it's nice to look at and feels....enlightening? I don't know the word but there's a certain 'fresh' feeling when I look at my clean room.And the real gauge of a relationship is how clean do I need to be when they come over.I don\u2019t keep friends if they judge me on my cleanliness.. they can either have me as a friend or not. The cleanliness of my house shouldn\u2019t be a factor.The real gauge of a relationship is being able to rip a real loud fart with your partner and laugh about it.That's more of a gauge of your own neurosis that your friendshipThis is stupid. I let people come over rarely, but the cleanliness of my house is not a factor. My house is probably cleaner than their's.I have friends who I have been friends with for 15+ years and there was a time I hated visiting their house because of how cluttered and dirty it was. They had 3 cats and a dog and EVERYTHING was caked in pet hair. There was so much junk they stored on their table we couldn't use it. \n\nSo no, it doesn't matter how long you have been friends with them. Clean your house before guests come over.For planned visits if you don\u2019t have your home clean you are disrespecting your friendsI don't clean my ass when my bros bend me over l.  Does that mean we're the bestest of friends?I'm so depressed and my place is so bad, no one is allowed over. Ever.No amount of love for my one good friend will let me allow him into my house because my coowner is my brother and he absolutely wrecks the damn place no matter how much cleaning I do. So I got sad and gave up and it went to hell, and I will never get to have a friend over inside my own houseIn the Midwest our moms even clean the inside of the fridge when company comes over.I clean my house because I want a comforting warm environment for my friends to visit and I care about them, not because I care about what they think of *me*Needs to be and desires to be are different things. We clean the house before the best friends come over because a clean environment promotes a happier more fun evening. We definitely don't have to clean before they come over.[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlRjbV-rT-E&ab_channel=NationalGeographic) about my homey.I\u2019m obsessively clean so it\u2019s clean regardless who comes overTrue for one on one, but I love having multiple friends over because then it keeps me in check with making sure things are up and ready and really clean.Yes, the more your respect your friends, the more cleaning you will do, naturally.Man I just finished cleaning my house bc of some friends coming over tomorrow, and was pondering this fact.what if you've never met any of your friends, what's the equivalent for discord friends\n\nhow clean your browser history is before calling?When my friends come over I hide in the clothes hamper.   :DNot really. Don't care at all unless it's a health risk or gross. Will occasionally extra clean so people don't think im always dirty. It's dirtier with closer friends because more relaxed.There's only so much you can do to keep a house clean with a child in the place.My friend being over gives me the strength to clean my house and they don't mind. Ultimate friend.I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m good enough friends with anyone to let them in my house. I don\u2019t let my family in my house. Not because it\u2019s dirty or gross or anything. Everything is just really old and second hand and a lot of my stuff is mismatched and kinda broken. No one wants to see this.I always clean up a bit before friends come over, because I don't want them to hang out in a dirty mess. They absolutely don't give a shit tho. My one friend is a bit on the messy side and has a dirty room most of the time and doesn't mind invite the boys over, and I also don't care about it.The other day I was talking to my mom and she was worrying about how much her friends would care about exposed food storage shelves she has that are out of the way and very practical and not at all an eyesore or anything like that.\n\nI asked her how much time she spends giving a shit about her own friends' shelves and she said none, but remained wishy washy on her own friends' opinion of totally normal and practical shelving.\n\nIt honestly made me kinda sad.A house that looks like it is ready to sell, vs that people actually live here makes me feel like I can't be myself because they're not showing me their genuine self.  Have a few dishes in the sink and some mail on the tableTbh I still go way overboard cleaning for my best friend, and we lived together in college. But I have anxiety so that might have something to do with itFriends, like fish, have too many bones and should only exist outside of a very clear boundary.\n\n-Benjamin FranklinI just really love cleaning my house, and I get excited having friends over, that clean even more. I just like them being comfortable in a relaxed, tidy environment. I love cleaning, makes me feel good.I thought it was how clean you need to be before you come over, as I only shower once a week, or once every two weeksNo need for *needing* to be clean if your place is regularly clean and tidy in the first place.\n\nAlso, If you \"don't have the time\" to clean up your stuff, then don't have the stuff in the first place. Cleaning up the stuff is also part of the \"maintenance cost\" of owning the stuff.Yeah someone I don't talk to anymore made me feel so nervous and then so ashamed of any forgotten thing that I realized we just weren't going to see eye to eye in the end and for my mental health I just slowly cut them off.\n\nTbh there was more to it than that, like I wanted to actually figure out what kind of a person I was after suppressing everything all my life and they wanted me to be more ambitious and get a fancy career and do this and that but I knew deep down that was not attainable for me. I needed and still need to just live and figure my mind out.\n\nMy uncle could come over spontaneously and I'd be like 'Yo sup come on in, lol. ' but I've seen the dudes car and room growing up so he ain't got any room to say anything anyways.\n\nWorking through cleaning shame and panic is hard. Anywhere I lived was always messy growing up, and as an adult I got so overwhelmed with all the things needing done I would literally rely on someone coming over so I could panic clean.\n\nBut panic cleaning was stressful and awful, and made me associate cleaning with panic and stress and awfulness even deeper. It's taken me about 15yrs of living on my own to help ease the association of cleaning with shame and panic. Now, if something needs done, it's okay, I don't have to do it. I don't have to berate myself in my head until I'm paralyzed with inaction and neither get anything done nor get to relax.\n\nI'm just like 'Well okay dishes need doing, but I don't need to do them. Let's instead just grab this plate when we go into the kitchen, cook some food, pick up a little bit on the floor, take a small break, and hey foods almost done let's clean a dish to eat off of and maybe one or two more. ' I just do little chores and bits instead of forcing myself to do entire big tasks, and it helps keep the apartment tidy and clean enough. \n\nI'm still working on it because I would like to be able to tackle whole tasks but there's a lot of self gentle parenting involved and I can't just change an entire lifetime of my brain's feelings in half as much time.Dude I clean my room when I bring a new plant home. You think I'm gonna invite _*people*_ over with a messy house??\n\nClearly you don't know the extent of my anxiety.I totally cleaned my bathroom yesterday because I went in thought fuck what if someone comes over.Hell, I love my girlfriend/best friend to death and I still try and have my house super clean before she's over.I find it courteous to clean as much as possible before having any guest over but if it's impromptu I'll not apologize for the mess if they're my friends because they dgaf; case in point, wife had surgery and I was busy nursing her back to health for a week and I allowed the house to get cluttered, but I wasn't embarrassed one bit when my best friends wife brought some food over for me and visited with my wife a bit.I've always said that there are two kinds of guests. Those that you clean house for before they come over, (to impress) and those that you clean up after they leave. (Because you had fun.)\n\nI prefer the latter.also, real gauge of of friendship is how clean they treat your house too.Had this convo with a friend about a month ago, I was putting the hoover away and he said \"did you hoover cos you knew I was coming? Why? You know I wouldn't care if you hadn't?\". To which I replied \"knowing people are coming over/going to see me is the only reason I hadn't devolved into so Gollum like creature living in darkness, can you imagine how weirder I'd be if no one ever saw me\". So yeah not required, but I like to.Friendship length is inversely correlated with cleanliness/tidiness levels. New friend? Deep clean. Old friend? Am I even going to flush the loo...\n\nThe issue is that the new friend is unfamiliar with your home and likely will not notice unclean items/areas but the old friend will see it all!I'm bullheaded, so if I'm by myself I can be a neat freak, but as soon as a roommate doesn't keep up their cleaning, I shut down bc I don't wanna clean their mess.Nahhhh, our friends have nicer places than ours, so when they come over I put in extra effort to clean to compensate. I want it to be as enjoyable of an experience as possible, even though it's smaller and a bit more out dated. Although I don't think any of our friends care, it's just something I do, also a good excuse for a deep clean.How organized I would say.\nCertain things as bathroom and kitchen sink is hygiene and that every friend is worth. I don\u2019t open the door to anyone before checking the lavabo.Pfft you don't clean for your best friends. You clean for the people you don't like as much to show them how nice your house looks in hopes that they think \"damn, my house is dirty\". LOLI would like to counter this with saying that getting the heads up that your cleanliness-minded friend is coming to visit is perfect because it's one of the few things that spur me to clean up around the house.My closest friend is put away the sex toys, pick up the dirty undies, and seen me naked non-sexually close.\n\nninja edit: she reminds me we forgot to put the sex toys away last time.My house is always immaculate. Either I have no friends or everybody's my friend.This might be the most profound shower thought I\u2019ve ever readA friend just told me I\u2019m a \u201cdon\u2019t have to clean up the house before you come over\u201d friendIt depend of if you are a girl or a guy, guy don\u2019t care about but girl \u2026Meh, I always tidy and clean it up as a sign of respect to whoever's coming over. I wouldn't be embarrassed to show them my mess, but I want them to be able to hang out in a tidy spaceWell, I imagine a good friend would tidy up their place a bit because they wouldn\u2019t want friends over in a filthy house.Wow. It's awesome how many wise and proactive people are commenting and how I'm seeing strategies I've learned from years of therapy popping up here. Also, thanks for posting this. It's rare that we have really insightful shower thoughts but this is definitely one of them.This is true. My best friend\u2019s house was super messy though, so honestly she wouldn\u2019t care. Also once when I went to sleep at her house, I assumed she had an air mattress, at the least, but no. She gave me a pillow and that was it, and I had to sleep at the foot of the bed, a twin bed might I add. I asked if I could sleep on the couch but she was like \u201coh my sister is asleep on the couch rn\u201dI think it more has to do with how often you see someone than how close you are with them. For example I have a handful of friends I'd consider my \"best friends\", but I don't physically see them very often, maybe once a year. So if one of them visits, I'll sure as hell clean my place before that. \nOn the other hand, of someone comes over every couple of days, even if I'm not so close with them, I won't clean for them anymore.Ive been dating my boyfriend for almost a year and I still do this before he comes over, or at least apologize if I didn't have timeWhat the heck do you mean? I love people coming over to my house and no matter how friendly I'm with them, I always clean the houseNope, the cleanliness of my home doesn\u2019t factor into our friendship. I simply HAVE to have a clean home. It\u2019s always presentable enough that if I had surprise guests, it wouldn\u2019t be embarrassing. It\u2019s not so much for them as it is for me.I don\u2019t like it when friends come over, period.. I rather visit them.Eh, there's a certain boundary of mess you shouldn't cross when you have someone over, no matter how close we are, I don't wanna see the shitstains in your toilet because you don't use a brush.And of course farts...Do you \n\na) go to the bathroom. (acquaintance level)\n\nb) fart and say excuse me (friend)\n\nc) fart deliberately in close proximity and make some funny quip such as singing 'Especially for you...'  (best buddy)I have been known to clean the inside of my house when someone is coming here to do outside work!   My house is usually tidy but if people are coming over and expected, then it gets a deeper cleaning.  If someone comes unexpectedly, my home is always passable.One time I got into the back seat of my buddies car and there was half a container of melted ice cream, we are still best buds 10 years later. He mustve always loved me cuz his room also looked like his car haha.I have a rule for the closer friends in my life\u2026\n\n**Untidy, but not unclean.**Idk the way you keep your home and the way you keep things at your workplace, IMO, are all an extension of yourself. If I'm going to have company over I'm going to make sure the house is clean. I don't understand how some people have others over with shit and piss stains in their toilets, dishes in the sink, nasty countertops and stovetops...then ask if I want food cooled by them? Nah, that's fucking nasty. Clean your damn places people whether it's friends or family. You look trashy of you can't. Controversial opinion, probably.It's funny because this is great for when you're young, but I'm discovering that adulthood is having the stick up your butt so you clean before ANYONE comes over.Even if we're close friends, I'd still like your house to not be absolutely disgusting if I'm coming over (I will do the same for you).If I won't clean it for me, I surely won't clean it for company.The real gauge of socialization is how dirty do we allow our homes to become.This reminds me of when I went to my childhood best friend's house on her birthday before her other friends arrived to spend some time alone with her. We were just playing around and messing things up in her drawing room. But as the time for her other friends to come was approaching, she asked me not to mess up the decoration anymore. She said that with only me being there, it was fine since I'm like her family but with others, she had to put up a presentable place. I felt so touched by that. It's been almost 8 years since that happened and even though I'm not best friends with her anymore (which sucks) I still think about it from time to time.I think people commonly mistake leveraging for friendship anyway.If friends are coming over I have more motivation to clean everything up.\ud83e\udd20 my grandmother still insists on a 2 day heads up \"so the house is presentable\" what does that say about our relationship \ud83d\ude48you mean that the more closer I am to someone the less care I give on preparing before they arrive?I like to have someone to watch t.v. while I clean the house. It makes me feel like i am still watching t.v. and can ask what's going on. Just come over and listen to me clean, but I have a hard time cleaning up by myself and end up getting buried in laundryMy friend runs a housecleaning company. I've quit cleaning prior cuz her jam is smoke a doobie, crank tunes and clean. We just chat away the whole time.  It's her stress release. I'm just the lucky one who lives closest. When others come by,if it's a bit dirty I blame her lol....lolNo, that's not how it works. My house is clean for ANYONE that comes into it because that's just the proper way to live and show respect for guests.That's probably why I don't have any friends. Way too much work to clean.It\u2019s so true I have a friend who has the messiest house ever but I still love going there just because it\u2019s fun with themI really like helping friends clean their house. It doesn\u2019t feel like a chore when I am helping someone else and it gives us something to do than just lounge (which I also love but sometimes I need to put my energy somewhere).Yeah no immaculate for my mom, my lifelong best friend, the stranger down the street\u2026 the answer is immaculate.I go between wanting to show how much I appreciate my friends by cleaning up before they come over (Afterall who wants to hang out in a messy environment) and being like fuck it, if they can't handle me at my worst, they don't deserve me at my best  and screaming THIS IS HOW I LIVE! When they walk into the door. \ud83d\ude02A buddy of mine is a hoarder and only lets a few come over. Should I feel honored that I\u2019ve seen his mess?My house usually is clean enough, but it's always messy. I keep a basket for unexpected visitors, so when they ring the bell downstairs (apartment building) I run around the living room to throw everything that's not supposed to be there in the basket and hide it in a closet \ud83d\ude05We have some good friends who I wish would clean a bit more before we come over. Place smells like shit.My friends hate that I clean when they come over. I like the excuse.I honestly just use my friends coming over as an excuse to clean up. Like not in the sense of \"oh no what would they think about me\".\n\nJust like \"ah friends are clmig over might as well vaccuum and clean the table\"nah my friend is just lazy and doesnt clean his house for anybodyThe real gauge of friendship is how much effort you have to put into getting dressed when they come over. Like if you come over and I\u2019m still in my bathrobe we family \ud83d\udc4aI feel like more so than your friend not caring what your house looks like, it's important to care that your friend isn't walking over trash to hangout with you.  It's a little insulting to expect people to put up with your shit in that way.Hahaha. So so true. I normally scrub every corner of my house if people I don\u2019t always hang with come over. But when good friends come? No fucks to give. \n\nMust admit though, I\u2019m a bit of a neat freak so even \u201cmessy\u201d my place is pretty clean and organized.I don\u2019t care if my house is a little messy. All I care about is a clean bedroomWe keep our house pretty spotless. We frequently entertain guests so me and my fianc\u00e9 joke about how the house must be clean enough to be \"party ready\" in 30 minutes.Yes, the closer you are, the dirtier they're allowed to see your house.Do people really enjoy living in a mess around them? I make it a point to clean at least 1 or 2 rooms a week or something like \"I'll vacuum all the rugs today\" or \"I'll wipe down all the counters\". Dishes are way easier to do before they pile up and so is laundry. I even see a lot of people blaming depression for being messy, but I get depressed and having a clean environment to live in is at least some form of self respect you can control and at least gives you something to keep your mind off it.The spectrum is kick those boxes outta the way - they cant know we sitYes and no. If i have a lot of respect for someone AND they are a real good friend I may still feel the right thing to do is to have a tidy house for them.Tell me you don't regularly clean your house without telling me you don't regularly clean your houseThe highest level of friendship is playing The Sims in front of them.My friend just told me this yesterday cause she\u2019s amaze by the idea of my tiny studio apartment. Meanwhile I\u2019m ashen of how easily it becomes a mess. But she told me it doesn\u2019t matter to herI have never wholeheartedly disagreed with something more.\n\nSome friends have kids or are stressed out from other things going on their lives and the very thought of trying to clean the house before some friends come over just adds further to that stress.\n\nWhat's wrong with just inviting some friends over and just chilling even if they didn't bother to clean? Nothing. Nothing is wrong with this.Joke\u2019s on you, I have OCD so I compulsively clean my home before I can get anything done, or anyone comes over for that matter.Super clean for new friends, and the messier and messier is more comfortable withYou guys don\u2019t clean your house for everybody? I never let anybody come over w/o putting everything in orderI keep my house in a consistent state of shite. If anyone mentions owt then they ain\u2019t coming over again.I don't know, I once stabbed a friend on accident and we're still on his termsWhy does having a clean house have to do with friendships visiting?\n\nI just like clean and organized no matter if friends are visiting or not...and I'd rather they don't visit, hate playing fake good hostAs a person with allergies that has friends with allergies, fuck this. I'd rather not have cat hair everywhere to bother them, I know how bad it is around dogs with owners that don't clean. \n\nI guess real friends prefer wheezing hives in their visitors or something? \n\nIf your place is that bad that an average person would be bothered, it's time for some self evaluation.First impressions matterLol...as if you could possibly make you house clean enough for your cat's standards. At best your cat will find you acceptable if you have a Roomba, since it means you bought your cat a robotic room to room chauffeurThis is the most wholesome thing I\u2019ve read all week.Holy shit I'm in the process of cleaning my apartment up right now for this exact reason. I'm glad I'm not the only one!This is adorable~~make a good first impression~~ set the right standards for cleanliness.I once took my headphones off while my cat was maowing at me because I wanted to better understand what he was saying. Didn\u2019t want to be rude either.Did she like it? :)\"Homer, are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie?\"The only reason my house is clean these days is because I got a cat. I\u2019ve always been terrible at cleaning and personally I don\u2019t even mind clutter but I don\u2019t want to subject my cat to it! He deserves a nice living environment.With cats the cleaner it is the more disappointing it is to themi do this whenever our family dog comes to visit. and make her bed look really nice.This is normal considering the cat is now your ownerNe too!!!Makes far more sense than people lolChadMe too!Lol I just had my first baby and the last few weeks leading up to delivery I went into psycho cleaning nesting mode and my husband asked why I was doing it and I told him I wanted to make a first good impression for our daughter and didn\u2019t want her to know how messy we are yet \ud83d\ude06I rearranged my whole living room in preparation for my cat. \n\nWanted to make sure she knew how important in the family hierarchy she is! \n\nMe\n\nCat\n\nChildren\n\nHusbandIronically, cats love clutter. More places to hide and interact with.A first impression is a lasting oneSmart, then when it gets messy again you can blame the catI got my hair done the day before my due date so that my baby could have a nice face to put to the voice he'd been hearingI did this when I got my dog. Even pressure washed the pavement in front of my house.This is wholesome.sameI didn\u2019t get this the first time\nSecond time I laughed way more than I expected many thanks stranger lolThis is called \"body doubling\" in the ADHD world, it's a very effective tool for getting chores done. I have 1 friend who's allowed to see my messy house and it'll get pretty clean by time she leaves.\n\nEdit: people in general can benefit from this, it's just particularly useful for those who struggle to do  chores/other tasks for whatever reasonDamn, that's such a good idea.Haha I usually facetime my parents for that, it\u2019s a win winI now live in a place with a dishwasher so I don't need any friends.That's a true friendHave you heard of podcasts?I use podcasts for a similar effectMe meanwhile with my weird preference for having a sparkling clean sink and kitchen top even before I start eating. \n\nI usually clean all the dishes used to cook before I eat, and take a small break in between the meal to clean the serving dishes that get empty while eating. \n\nBy the time am done, the only 2 dishes left are plate and my glass.and gotta get them to help out too!It\u2019s like my only little dopamine boost. I make myself get up and clean my space so I can at least be depressed in comfort.My depression keeps me from cleaningI'm with you.  I've got 8 year old twins and a 13 year old, all diagnosed with ADHD.  My life is a shit-storm.  There are very few things I truly have control over, and having a clean house is the best I've come up with.\n\nBedrooms and the playroom are exceptions, but all of the living space is spotless and in order every night.I can't leave a mess or crumbs as I might get house hipposThis is me 100%. I feel anxious and defeated if my place is a mess.My issue is the cleaning seems to cause my depression. Ugh. Doing this again. What's the point got to do this again next week too. Existence is pointless, what's the god damn point of life if this is all life is. I miss split screen haloIronicalaly i end up losing things the cleaner my room is, when its dirty ass fuck i just come across shit i need.Man I wish I had the productive type of depression. I might not be so depressed.Im happy for you /posLove that you have spontaneous visitors - I wish I still had a friend group like this!Dude this is something I wish my wife would understand and implement. She's a major scatterbug, in that all her shit is scattered everywhere all the time, whereas I tend to keep my stuff in somewhat designated piles. Every time there's even a notion of people coming over, she goes into frenzy cleaning and drags me along. I keep trying to hammer into her that if she'd just keep her shit picked up as she went along, we wouldn't have the stress and headaches of frantically picking up the house last minute. She's getting better about it, but god damn woman lol.\n\nFor the record, I love the fuck outta my wife, even if she is a nut job from Mars.Sometimes I enjoy these comments that sound like an induction notice for a alien visiting the planet for the first timeAgreed. This is also a gauge for you and your friends growing up, I think. My husband's friend group came over right after Christmas this year, and when they left I looked around and realized the only clean up necessary was putting the leftover food away in the fridge\u2013 paper products were already thrown out, glasses were in the sink, empty bottles were in the recycling.  It was great.\n\n\nFeels like it wasn't too long ago that I'd have to nudge the one drunk dude passed out under the Christmas tree to make sure he was still alive while we picked up a mountain of dishes and crumbs, and make sure there weren't any half empty bottles stashed around.I disagree. Not because real homies don\u2019t clean, but because regular nice people ALSO help clean. \n\n\nI\u2019ve organized many parties where guests I don\u2019t even know would insist on helping with the dishes, putting stuff away. Hell, I\u2019ve had people vacuum. \n\n\nMy super close friends by contrast are passed out drunk on the couch, cause they know my house is 100% safe.I get anxious when someone starts cleaning my shit. I know they don't mind doing it and I would also do it for them but I just want them to just sit down and have a beer.I've told my real friends that sometimes I don't need them to help, just to keep me company and be a \"cheerleader\" while I do it. The best friends are 100% up for that.Uhh what? You expect your friends to clean your place for you?\n\nLike maybe after a party or something. Is that what you meant?Guests in my home don't have to clean anything, my home my responsibility.Absolutely not. Having your friends do your work is awfula \"real homie\" wouldn't let their friends clean thoughThe real advice is always in the comments.On the flip side, if the reason you haven't invited me over to hang out is because you haven't had the time or energy to clean, F-it - it's more important we hang out.That last paragraph hits the nail on the head for me!I clean my house super well for my friends when they come over. I want them to feel as comfortable as possible.  Also sometimes it's the only thing that motivates me to clean at all hahaIt\u2019s not that they\u2019ll mind, it\u2019s that I\u2019ll mind. \n\nEdit: based on the responses I imagine many of your lives are absolutely ideal and also that many of you are highly delusionalThere is a certain level of mess where anyone will mind, mind you. Doesn't apply to a few dishes though.I use to work in hospice. I went into LOTS of peoples homes during a very difficult time and would often hear I'm so sorry about the mess. Most of the time it was just simple living things like they had dishes in the sink or kids/pet toys laying around. I would always say \"it's okay you are allowed to live in your own home. You have more important things on your mind than making it spotless for me. I promise my house is the same.\"\n\n\nIt's crazy that our society has made it seem like your house is dirty if you live in it and have just the basic cleaning needs.As Leonard Cohen put it, \"Here's to the few who forgive what you do, and the fewer who don't even care.\"CockroachesI keep my house clean because I want to live in a clean house. Can't relax and enjoy my free time if there's stuff to be done.Yeah I felt like the intention of this post is more the opposite of how most people are taking it. Because if you\u2019re incredibly good friends with someone, you aren\u2019t worried about appearances the way you would be with someone who you aren\u2019t as close with. They already know who you are and you wouldn\u2019t feel self conscious about your home being slightly messyI picture it as a kind of reverse \"low, middle, high IQ\" meme, the ones where low and high are correct but the middle is wrong/stupid.\n\nNo cleaning at all = you don't care about them enough to make an effort for the place to be fairly nice, loads of cleaning = paranoia they'll judge you, which a decent friend wouldn't. Middle ground is perfect where you take care of anything properly grim but don't lose sleep over a bit of dust or dish in the sink.It's great that you have people you can ask for that kind of support. I've also learnt to do that and to ask friends to organise that we go for coffee or breakfast over weekends so I have a reason to get up and going. It really works.\ud83e\udd7a that is so wholesome \ud83d\udc93You seem to have some good friends. I think I may also from benefit from this type of system. Shall try soonIt's easier to clean someone else's depression nests, than it is to clean your own.no lol. i could never let my friends help me tidy up mess that i made in my own home that is just embarrassing. i am sure i could think of a good few excuses as to why they should or could but i could neverFor me it\u2019s the latter. I used to not care but then my MIL said something that\u2019s stuck with me ever since. She said a clean house is a sign of consideration for your friends, and a way to show them you care about their comfort. So now I clean even or especially for my close friends.They could just not like living in filth and while just visiting a friend doesn\u2019t have to be for long, it doesn\u2019t mean they should put up smelling and sitting in a mess.I\u2019m like this, but really I just like a clean place and it\u2019s an excuse. The best case scenario is a friend canceling after I\u2019ve cleaned and I can just enjoy my extra clean space.It\u2019s because men are judged by the jobs they have and women are judged by the homes they keep. It sucks, but it\u2019s true. Until society stops judging this way, wives will freak out and clean before someone comes over.Bruh. Count your blessings. \nI would take a neat freak over someone that can\u2019t even put the lid back on a bottle and put it away after using it. Aka my girlfriend.Are you by any chance from the boomer generation? (All my aunts and my mom are that way)I use inviting people over as motivation to finish yet another part of my home. That way it gets cosier in the long term \ud83d\udcaaMy husband and I used to have this discussion often, until I managed to get it through in his head that oftentimes people will (at subconscious level, or plain conscious) judge the woman of the house if the place isn\u2019t tidy. It is not their fault, mostly it is cultural and generational, but it still happens, which is why I feel more pressured than my husband to have the house looking nice when people are coming over.My mom has to find weird angles to take picture of food to send to my grandparents because \"they'll fuss if they see the mess.\"Mine is: \n\nThis isn't an inspection. I'm here to spend time with you.That's a rough, but accurate, description of depression cleaning.This guy comes in and writes \"it depends on these specific scenarios I thought of\" in a paragraph coat, and redditors up vote it because \"Many word!  Much profound!\"\n\nThe reason the replies are bringing up depression is cause for you to do some research on avolition, it's a very serious thing and a massive struggle for many.  It's a mud pit I have been wrestling my way out of since the pandemic started, some weeks I get closer to the top than others, but I always bottom out.  It sucks and prevents many people from finding the energy to do these basic things.\n\nI make a point to do very minor cleaning (just the important stuff, bathrooms, garbage, etc) when I have friends coming over, because my friends don't tend to be much better, but also, if they mention it in a negative light, it makes it easier not to have them over again.  I am who I am, hiding your life behind doors for those outside them is simply unhealthy and potentially has some red flags.There can also be very different perceptions of what counts as clean. And sometimes we have to accomodate to a visitors viewpoint to make them comfortable. I find a spotless home somewhat uncomforting and tend to have clutter around me while still maintaining self worth. \nI am not talking about hoarders with mouldy dishes here. That should be taken care of regardless, I agree.Sounds preachy and judgemental.I have so much self respect I don\u2019t need something as arbitrary and external as the \u201ccleanliness of my house\u201d to validate my own self respectThis is the kind of statement made by someone who hasn't been beaten down by 5 kids.Someone\u2019s never had depression before. How lucky for you.Dude I\u2019m fucking tiredThey don\u2019t have pets or kidsThis is a good distinction.  My house is always \u201cclean\u201d but with twin toddlers running around, it is almost never \u201ctidy\u201dWho's blood is it?A really good friend will pretend there's no blood on the walls, nor screams coming from the basement. Of course a really scared stranger will too.Username checks outFurst impressions matterWhy are we limiting to just friends?First impressions ... *litter*Black Lives MatterI don\u2019t think cats find anyone acceptable.  If they find you tolerable you\u2019re winning.Good luck with the cat! I\u2019m sure they will appreciate it :)Good luck with your new kitty!I do that all the time. I practically live in headphones and anytime a cat or dog in my vicinity starts making noises I take them off to respond. The only one I stopped responding to is my friend\u2019s husky and that\u2019s because he thinks my awoo back at him is like an invitation to fight for dominance and that dog is gonna find out why humans are considered apex predators if he tries to fight me. I\u2019m not afraid to wrestle a dog if he hops on me first.He was scared and hid under my bed, but at least it was clean under there!Oh, a dog like this you gotta feed everyday.Well dogs deserve that because they are really friendly and I f****** love them.Well I don't think anyone can understand cats those they are very complex people you just can't predict their mood or what they are going to do they just do stuff that you never expect them to do.Is this why I study/work wayyy more efficiently when I'm around other people? I wish I learned this term years agoWait, really? Is that why I only feel like doing chores when I invite someone over?My brother who\u2019s autistic with sometimes just randomly go into cleaning mode if he sees me cleaning. He\u2019ll be talking to me and then mindlessly start doing what I\u2019m doing. \ud83d\ude02I didn't know there was a name for it. I tend to wash my my dishes and fold my clothes whenever I talk to people on the phone. This is one of the reasons why I like talking to people on the phone.Huh, today my autistic ass learned something that explains so much about why I prefer to have hobbies *with* someone...\nWeirdI really need someone for this in my life. I've been texting people but no luck yet.What\u2019s up with this? Am I the only one who needs to be alone in order to properly study/focus?The only time I don't like this is if they live with you and can't get their chores done without you being there. It's annoying after a while. You're not a baby. Figure out a way to entertain yourself. Listen to a podcast or some music. I have things to do too.I have had friends clean my sink out before, but I'd never expect any of them to do this lolHoly shit TIL this explains so muchI've noticed this when I do chores with my roommate. It never feels like doing chores like when I do them alone.Whoaaaaa is this why I am burned out by the time I'm done grocery shopping by myself, but actually find it enjoyable with my partner?God, it's always ADHD\n\nWhat about he doesn't want to feel lonely doing the dishes?Personally i hate when people do that. You should have the house clean before people come over or just leave it that way. Its not polite for the guest. other examples like listening to music while doing homework that's definitely adhd right? We all have adhd at this point lolGo outside and clean the street around your house, at least you are getting some sun out of itYou can come clean my house. It will help with your depression.That's how I feel, except because of ADHD, I don't get that dopamine boost from completing these kinds of tasks, so the habit doesn't form easily. But then the anxiety relief of deep cleaning my house after it's been a disaster for a while is pretty niceI\u2019m depressed because I don\u2019t clean. And I don\u2019t clean because I\u2019m depressedStart with one thing it doesn't matter how small it is. That's what i did and it's helping. Then try to keep it clean. \n\nIf you fail, it was one small thing.\n\nBest of luck \ud83e\udd1eThere's a website/app called [UnFuckYourHabitat](https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/the-depressionmessy-house-cycle/?pagenum=1&category=life-happens) and it has some significantly helpful tips on exactly this issue. I hope you see it and that it helps!i got a cat, so now everyday, no matter how depressed i have to care for them and clean their box. That gives me a boost that is very often what i needed to go clean something else.My depression comes from cleaningWe finally broke down and decided to have a cleaning service come twice a month. It's a little expensive, but the mental health difference for me is huge. It also gives us a reason to pick up at least every other week so they can clean, and it usually doesn't get too bad in between anymore. Skipping eating out a couple times to cover it is totally worth itAin\u2019t nothing like a good depression cleaning every 6 months.Every time I clean my room my suicidal thoughts get stronger. So I try not to do it so often.This is gonna sound silly, but my cleaning motivation is watching hoarders. \n\nI never want to get that bad. I never want to even get close to that situation.My friends come to see me to clean my home\n\nI'm a mess :(Me too bud, me too. I have ignored so many loved ones because I didnt think it was that bad, its nothing unique, people get sad over bad things that happen, I'll get better. But nope I had to face the fact it was actually debilitating depression. Seek outside help. Dont be like me and spend years either being stuck or going backwards.   Keep trying different things.Can you smoke weed? That helps me.Mine does both. Pull yourself out of a spiral by cleaning. Then try to do something for yourself. That is probably why you are depressed. Your Will is subordinate to people you dgaf. Hobbies help but I do community service.It sounds like everyone nowadays has ADHDAll boys too?yes for adhd cleaning home is bestWhat if I like my place clean but I want house hippos?Dirty dishes: *exist*\n\nMe: \ud83d\udc80I hope its not rude, but that last sentence threw me off guard so I had to chuckle!You only need to do a few things (vacuuming, changing bed sheets l) again next week if you start cleaning after yourself and don\u2019t let things pile up or get messy.Get some pills. It had helped me to the point of 95% of pre-depression state of mind\n\nEverything else (gym / doing chores / self-awareness / ...) I find to be only a cheap gimmickSame!When I was a child everyone who came over used to be spontaneous, a knock at the door and they\u2019d be invited in. Nowadays it\u2019s not like that, I\u2019ve had no spontaneity for a while. However the other day my friend (who usually plans everything out with me beforehand like a week or so) randomly showed up at my door and said \u201chey get in the car we\u2019re going for a ride\u201d.\n\nWe just drove around until we found somewhere to go, and I\u2019m really thankful they just dropped in and told me to just go because if it had been planned, I\u2019d be overthinking everything and probably end up cancelling my plans. I had an extremely shitty day that day and they didn\u2019t even know\u2026 but them turning up out of the blue really helped me feel better without them realising it.We might be married to the same woman.I thought that was normal growing up. Turns out my mum just had adhd too.Ooops I'm that woman. I love you too my different type of nut job husbandI don't know man. My wife is a bit of a neat freak with ocd. She is constantly stressing herself out over keeping the house clean (even if guest aren't over) and then she still stresses out and goes into a frenzy when we have guests coming over. \n\nFeel like we miss out on a lot of quality time because she is constantly trying to keep the house clean.My gf is super tidy and still goes batshit crazy cleaning if she hears someone we know might be coming to stop by.One trick I found out helped me, is big clear see-through plastic boxes. I use them to throw away stuff to sort out later - one box is for non-organics going into recycling, one is for stuff going into closets, etc. It's really much easier to clean if things are somewhat piled up already, as you said.How about helping instead of \"hammering\" her???Agreed. I would also like to add that any guests you are not close with that offer to help clean up are automatically homies too.Nah my homies will do that but then clean up in the morning with me.  Don\u2019t even ask they just do.Sorry to tell you but those are not good friends, A proper adult would strive to keep such a safe place clean, because the know its extra work for YOU. \n\nI just feel like it's the ultimate bullshit excuse, no one is more comfortable than me at my house and I still clean. When I go to a friend I do the same, If I can't cause I pass out I do it first thing next morning, that's is just basic respect, I would do that for anyone, even strangers. \n.Helping with dishes is a cry for help, dude. They needed a friend and you just brushed them off.No, I never expect anyone to clean up anything for me if I throw a party or have a get together because, obviously, it's ultimately my responsibility to keep my house clean. I'm just saying the real homies are the ones who offer to *help you*/insist on *helping you* clean up afterwards, whether it be a small thing such as taking out the trash or helping with dishes.I've definitely cleaned on regular visits. Mostly because I was disgusted and wanted a somewhat clean place while I was there. Also because I knew they were struggling and wanted to do something nice. Bottom line tough, if your friends come over and immediately start cleaning you may not have your life together.I'm not saying that I'm demanding my friends to help clean up my place for me. I realized the way I said it sounded a bit wrong.... What I basically meant to say is that the real close friends are *usually* the ones who would offer to help or insist on helping you clean up. Obviously, I don't expect any help because it's after all my place and I'm the host (i.e. my responsibility). If they don't want to help, that's more than fine with me. I'm just grateful that they even came, and that's all I can even ask for.Why?Or if you need help cleaning, i will come help! No judgement. Sometimes mental illness gets in the way and i get it.Out of curiosity, what specifically will you mind? I had a roommate that felt bad about not having the place spotless for when I came back from vacation/time away, and that felt odd to me because *they live there*.Why do you mind though? Or more specifically why do you suddenly mind the mess when someone else is there but you didn't mind when you were alone. Especially if you know they don't mind why do you? What is it exactly that you mind? The mess itself, or someone seeing that mess? Why do you not want someone to see it? If you're embarrassed by it on your own regardless of what they think then why do you only feel that embarrassment when they show up?\n\nI personally think more people should ask themselves these types of questions. Instead of just saying you feel some way and then directly acting upon that with no further thought process; you should explore your thoughts and feelings and try to dig deeper and figure what you truly feel and why you think/feel that way and if you should think/feel that or if you would like change the way you think/feel or just so you can better work around it after more deeply understanding yourself and your thoughts and feelings.Oh there'll be roaches, just not the skittering kind.At the same time, I want to create a nice space for my friends to hangout. Having it dirty can potentially put a damper on thingsRight! And the way I learnt to ask for help was kinda funny actually. I was 14 and already struggling with depression but I hadn\u2019t been diagnosed so I was a mess in school and everywhere. My classmate who sat beside me saw how messy my bag and file was and she was like \u2018oh my god what\u2019s up with ur bag?\u2019. At first I was kinda ashamed cos this classmate was an all-rounder, straight As, president of student council, the whole nine yards and I thought she was judging me. Turns out, she was genuinely concerned and much to my protests, she helped arrange my bag and files. I wish the best for her always.Yeah that's how I feel about it--if I go over someone else's place and it's gross, I feel a little uncomfortable. Clutter is fine of course, but actual dirt and bad smells aren't great. I don't want to inflict that on my friends.\n\nHaving friends over is actually my main motivator for cleaning--I like hosting d&d at my place once a week because it forces me to do something about the mess *and* make a wholesome, healthy meal.Yeah. I hate being invited to sit on crumbs and have my socks get stuck on sticky sauce on the floor. It's not that I will look down on them, but feels kind of mistreated. When they have infants and toddlers, it's a different story because I'm there to clean the shit out for them.The difference is an unexpected visit. A close friend can drop by even if the house is wrecked, but I'll show consideration by cleaning up when they're invited over.Hit me right in the feelsHad this happen today and I was thrilledExactly. It took me a while to understand why I felt this pressure to clean and my husband didn\u2019t. But I eventually figured out that this was why, so we talked about it and it changed a lot the cleaning dynamic (in a good way :-))Agreed. I'm not sure why the wife just half-asses things. It's like she'll go through the motions for the task but not fully complete the task. It's frustrating but sometimes you have to just woooossaaahhh and bite your tongue to keep the peace.I\u2019m Gen z\n\nIt fucking rubbed off on me People have different ideas about what they will live with and not. \nMy mother didn't clean house and I wasn't allowed to have friends over. My stepmother keeps her home guest ready at all times. It's not an effort for her and my father because they put things away as they go and clean up regularly. \nI try to keep a clean house but it could be better.We\u2019re children of boomers. Funny thing is my mom and Aunts didn\u2019t care about how their houses looked. My grandmother on the other hand, she cleaned everyday but Sunday. Had a schedule for each day. It was a compulsion. But her house was spotless. Even with carpet in the bathroom was immaculate.Even better, I\u2019m stealing it.Depression cleaning?I don\u2019t preach anything. I could not care less what others do in their home. \n\nJudgemental? If you assume no correlation between someone\u2019s self-respect and the care they have for the environment they live in, then yes.It\u2019s not arbitrary lmaoThat is not what self respect means. Self respect is a result of honouring yourself (a.k.a self care). \n\nImagine you go to someone\u2019s house and you find a complete dump with human excrements sitting on their chair. Would you not lose respect for that person? (assuming he is in his/her physical capability to clean). \n\nSelf respect is not a mindset. It is the result of your actions.I don\u2019t understand your point. Which part of what I said highlights that I have never fought depression?What they said makes complete sense to me and I struggle off and on with major depression. A huge theme, along with low energy levels, is \u201cI don\u2019t deserve a clean space.\u201d Obviously, that is not logical, it\u2019s the depression speaking. Often just completing one tiny task like wiping down a counter (not too overwhelming) boosts my self esteem and makes me feel like I can accomplish something. The self respect I feel from that motivates me to keep it up and move on to bigger tasks.I don't know what your schedule is like but I take a few hours on my day off to do basic tidying up. A little bit makes a big difference over time.Lazy *Mine.Did they get rid of free awards? You needs one.*Faust impressions*Furst impurressions, if you willfirst impurressions matterFur impressions matterif you have guests round that are not relatives or friends then i think its standard to fully clean the house.. this is only gauging friends because it is implying that a lot of it can be left messy because it is someone you know and that will accept you\n\nalthough it is common and harmless to think this.. i advise not doing so if you can help it lol.. keep a tidy home for yourself if no one elsecats always appreciate a nice freshly cleaned space to knock stuff down intoDid he get the courage to come out from there? My new boy is curled up in a corner and can\u2019t be coaxed out (yet).Anytime my friend gets a new cat she gets a box and puts a plant in front of it. She says it\u2019s so the cat has a cloaked area to peek around and scope out the situation until their comfortable, like a predator in the wild watching it\u2019s prey from the tall grass lol.My productivity doubles, instead of wasting 95% of the time I only wast 90%The simple way I understand my ADHD & GAD is the Buddhist term \u201cMonkey Mind.\u201d I have an overactive one, so some type of stimulation to keep me present, helps the other part of my brain focus. In school I always could listen better if I was doodling.Interesting, I can't study for shit around other people. I find the presence of others so distracting because I want to talk to them instead of focusing on my work!That's why I always feel I work better while in class than at home! I thought it was because in class you're surrounded by your colleagues (and hopefully friends too) who are all working on the same thing as you and you don't feel you're doing it alone, and it motivates you to keep going :oOr it could just be because you need a reason to not look people in the eyePodcasts are it for me. I welcome chore days because it's just 1 hr of podcasts / audio history books.[deleted]Huh, I constantly do this and at my mum's for example will be talking to her then ten minutes later realise that I've just straightened out the kitchen without realising I've been doing it, wish I could direct that instinctive energy to my own sideboards and clutter. Hadn't thought about it being related to being autistic though[deleted]When my husband talks to people on the phone, he paces the entire house and yard repeatedly and quite quickly, usually with one arm straight out beside him.\n\nWhen I talk on the phone I lie on my side wherever the closest soft spot is and lay the phone across my cheek and ear so that I don\u2019t have to hold it or move at all.\n\nWe are very different people in a lot of ways.No i'm the same as you.I have the opposite problem, I hate cleaning when my roommate's home. Makes me really self-conscious for some reason, like he's judging how dirty I am or thinking I'm judging him for not being perfect, even though logically I know he's not> Figure out a way to entertain yourself\n\nAt least for people with ADHD, it is generally about accountability rather than entertainment (though that is nice too)\n\nEven if you are both working on different things, just the presence of another person can make it feel like the other person is holding you accountable. For some, it can feel a little like the feeling that you shouldn\u2019t do something inappropriate because you are in public or like when your boss is keeping a close eye on you and so you don\u2019t want to look like you are goofing off, but less negative (so maybe more like you want to impress the other person).\n\nIf you were talking about people without executive function disorders, then feel free to keep feeling how you do, even if it does make you sound kind of grumpy. \n\nBut if you were not, please keep in mind that, for people with those disorders, body doubling is an effective technique for completing important tasks and being responsible, so being called a child can feel really shitty, particularly when making sure you complete even the simple tasks can be a struggle against your own brain.They never claimed op has adhd just giving an anecdotal example of how some people with adhd cope.Right? Fun fact, commenting about redditors being enormous mental illness hypochondriacs to excuse their character flaws is actually a symptom of ADHD. Go get checked, it definitely won\u2019t make it nearly impossible for people with real issues to get screenedOr maybe spice things up with a little B and E cleaning!This used to be me. Something that really helped was doing \"three tasks per day\".  Any \"task\" could be as small as I wanted it to be in any day, but my goal was always three.\n\nIt could be as small as taking my clothes off the floor and throwing it in the hamper three feet away. Or taking the used dishes and putting them in the sink. Or cleaning a *single* dish. \n\nOften times if I got myself to clean one dish, I'd clean the rest and count it as \"one\", but it was okay if I didn't.  I never held myself to that. The point is always to not do nothing, particularly when doing *anything* was really hard. \n\nAnd it made everything a little easier.  Having my home a mess definitely affected my wellbeing and regularly doing just a little bit helped keep me from hitting my bottom. Then my good days were more often where I could do more daunting tasks like \"laundry\" and \"exercising\".\n\nIt's been a long time since then and I'm in a way better place, but I believe that this was one of the most important bits that helped me start digging my way out from over a decade of depression.It's a vicious cycle.*fat bastard has entered the chat*I drink to forget that I'm ashamed of drinking.In the words of Admiral William Mcraven;\n\n\"If you can't do the little things right, you'll never be able to do the big things right. And if by chance have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made, that you made. And a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better. So if you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.\"Here's another trick that has helped me. Link certain chores together so that you always do them together. For example every time you take out the garbage, clean your kitchen. Every time you pay your electric bill, deep clean your bathroom. Every time you do laundry, vacuum your floors.\n\n I kept falling into a routine of doing the absolute bare minimum, but this way I do a little extra each time I do a bare minimum chore.Yes, just need to start. \n\nI have also found that any way to make something novel helps a ton. Any new cleaning solution or tool is usually pretty cheap ($5-10) and will motivate me to clean. Right now it\u2019s the Pink Stuff. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually any better than regular Ajax or comet but when I see my sink looking a little ugh, I\u2019m excited to use that pink stuff! And then my sink is clean and my kitchen looks 10x better. \n\nAnother thing is keeping the cleaning stuff near where I need it. I have two floors with my kitchen downstairs and primary bathroom upstairs so I have duplicates of a lot of cleaning supplies stored in each location. If I\u2019m brushing my teeth and see the mirror is dirty, I\u2019m much more likely to clean it if the windex and paper towels are steps away versus having to go all the way downstairs and bring stuff upstairs and then take it back downstairs to put it away.My depression: \"wow good job dumbass, you can't even do one tiny little thing right\"I used their app a lot a couple of years ago.My depression cleaning comes fromWould you mind me asking why?I don\u2019t like smoking anything.  I\u2019d love some weed I didn\u2019t have to smokeA little can definitely help with mundane tasks and chores.\n\nUsing a ton or chronic use will more likely than not just make motivation even harder.\n\nParticularly if you always use it whenever you have to do those tasks, because eventually you won\u2019t be able to do those tasks without it. \n\nIn other words, moderation people!It's certainly getting diagnised more now. I suspect I might be neurodivergent in some way but I can't face the thought of trying to find out. It's not like it would miraculously change anything but it might be nice to know there's a reason I don't feel 'normal'.You could leave out some peanutbutter toast for them.I can't start cooking another meal if there are any dirty dishes that need doing.I have kids and animals. I wish it was only me. I would probably never have to clean the way I do if it was only meIt's because exercise, good eating habits, good sleep and all that can sometimes only be accomplished when you are able enough. Not cheap gimmicks at all, but they can't fix the situation if you are deep enough in depression.\n\nHowever, when you climb out of the worst of it, those habits are very helpful in making sure you don't fall into the hole again in the future. Body and mind maintenance.Sounds like you have an awesome friend \u2764\ufe0fMy wife apparently has a lot of spouses.I\u2019m also this woman \ud83d\ude02You can do both lol. At a certain point it's unfair to continue ignoring something your spouse keeps bringing up and expecting them to just fix it for you.How it should be, if they don't they are not your hommie.Your comment feels nice>  I would do that for anyone, even strangers\n\nWhich kind of proves my point. Cleaning is not a good indicator of level of friendship.\n\n\nYou seem like a nice person. A clean person. I\u2019m not saying real friends don\u2019t clean. I\u2019m just saying, I don\u2019t use cleanliness as a a measure of closeness.Correct. Grab any leftover glasses and at least bring them to the kitchen. Help walk around with a trash bag. It makes for a good chat time as well.wtf do you mean why\n\nI'm not going to pass on my chores to them?Well it\u2019s gonna make me a little uncomfortable if someone comes over and there\u2019s dirty dishs everywhere, mud all over the floor, pee all over the toilet, etc. Especially if there\u2019s not even a place to sit. It\u2019s almost like inviting someone over for dinner and giving them a cup noodle, wouldn\u2019t you be a little embarrassed?\n\nEdit: think depression nestWhy do you mind though? Or more specifically why do you suddenly mind *being naked* when someone else is there but you didn't mind when you were alone. Especially if you know they don't mind why do you? What is it exactly that you mind? The nakedness itself, or someone seeing that nakedness? Why do you not want someone to see it? If you're embarrassed by it on your own regardless of what they think then why do you only feel that embarrassment when they show up?\n\nIt's a question of image. I don't want these people to have an image of me as a vulnerable, naked person. I might *be* a vulnerable, naked person beneath my clothes, but I don't flaunt that to everyone.\n\nLikewise, I don't want these people to have an image of me as a dirty slob. I might *be* a dirty slob, but I don't flaunt that to everyone.\n\nIt's not the best comparison but I hope it makes sense. It's all about image. We want people to have a positive image of us, so a dirty home comes with negative connotations that we are trying to avoid.Oh I mind the entire time when I\u2019m alone and when I have companyThat was great of her. Especially since she was also just a teenager. I was that straight A overachiever until I hit second year university and the bipolar hit me hard. I didn't have any support at the time. Fortunately over the years I found good doctors and good people to surround myself with and I kinda bounced back. Could still have done better for myself had I know who to ask etc earlier, but I guess it is what it is. I'm ok now and that's most important.D&D is my main motivator for cleaning too!So what you're saying is rent an infant or toddler for when people come over so I don't have to clean?I get what you're saying, but I don't think the poster was talking about having a complete dump. I agree with them that my self-respect isn't defined by the cleanliness of my house. Some chores go a bit longer without getting attention. And I know it wouldn't match some people's needs for cleanliness, but I don't define it as dirty. And I still feel good about myself and where I live. I definitely see some people that do place more importance on it thoughPersonally, I wouldn't lose respect for them but I would be concerned. Sometimes we all need a helping hand, doesn't mean we don't respect ourselves.I\u2019m surprised people are downvoting you so much. What you\u2019re saying is true from a psychological perspective. There are even therapeutic interventions for depression that encourage taking small actions that will result in higher self esteem over time. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re blaming people for having depression. You\u2019re just stating a fact that a clean, safe environment is a good indicator of self respect. It\u2019s also fair to say that people with depression struggle with self esteem which can make self care harder to do.Well that's a relief.I just realized I never cleaned my blood off of my basement stairwell..... But most people don't want to go down there anyways.Aww thanks stranger! Don't worry about the award though. Your up vote and comment are more than enough \ud83d\ude42hold my beerYeah they went away for many people, including meIt's called an upvote, the original free award.Furst imputessions meowterJust go sit near him, helped with one of my kitties, it takes a few days to get them to even come out when you can see. After a few weeks they'll likely be roaming around even when visible. Patience is key. Make sure you have hiding spots in other rooms that you'll be in, so he can go from hiding spot to hiding spot to follow you if he wants.When we got our first cat, he immediately darted under the couch and stayed there all afternoon. At some point during the night he started exploring and next morning we woke up to him curled up on the couch. \n\nMy advice would be to give him space and let him go at his own pace. He will come to you when he\u2019s ready.Jackson Galaxy has great videos on Youtube. Helped me a lot with my kitties.My best advice is to be approachable, not approaching in this stage. Your boy will likely go investigate your place when you're asleep and come to you on his own terms.That's a huge increase though ! You do double the things !Math checks outBut at least you get to waste 90% of someone else\u2019s time, excellentI\u2019m the same.  I need to be doing something else in order to access the \u201cflow state\u201d.I too could listen better if I was doodling. Teachers never understood that and forced me to sit straight and stare at the board. \n\nNow I have a office job and during meetings I still doodle the fuck out of things. I don't even care what somebody thinks of me anymore. They may fire me one day soon. I'm already mentally prepared for it. Maybe I'll sue them for discriminating me for my ADD or something. \n\nFuck people.Weird. I don't suffer from ADHD but I had similar experiences. I always had to have fairly consistently paced music playing while studying and took notes in lectures even though I knew complete notes would be supplied later on. Guess maybe it works more universally as well. Or maybe I am somewhere on the spectrum but not as seriously affected. I do now also two Ritalin but because of bipolar depression. It just gives me the kick I need to get started.People smoke cigarettes for the same reason.I can't always do it, but I focus so much better if I have an easy knitting project. Something I don't have to look at or use special techniques and math for is great for keeping me focused on a conversation or whatever.Ooooh this is a thing?\n\nI always explained it/understood it for myself as like needing to partition one half of my brain.\n\nNever understood why it was helpful.Holy fuck. I am born in the year of the monkey. And this describes me. How fascinating.I absolutely am guilty of this lol & i find myself losing the things i \u201ccleaned up\u201d because i was distracted by the conversationYour comment reminded me of a guy I met who would close his eyes every time he spoke to me (or anyone). It was a little off putting.For me it's because I tend to get lost in my own musings, so I need someone on the outside to tether my attention to the outside.Yeah I agree, your friends should only be inviting you over for happy romp fun times.\n\nDon't be surprised when shit goes real bad for you and all your 'friends' tell you they don't wanna hear about that shit, they just wanna play video games, bro!I don\u2019t think he was putting it down to autism, but more the fact he starts cleaning without being as acutely aware he\u2019s doing a boring task and having to make that decision to do it himself. \n\nThis whole thread has made me wonder if I a) have ADD and/or b) am autistic, at 31 years of age lol.Me too, I need to be closed off in my own world without \"big\" external distractions. My brother was looking after my dogs for a few months and in that time my place was sparkling clean, he came back and was in shock. It was amazing.This is me with my partner! I love when he's gone and I get to deep clean, throw out stuff, and completely reorganize. It's such a great flow state but when he's home we like to talk together too much loli also hate doing stuff when other people around  i always feel like iam being watchedSame! But with partners or parents. Cleaning could only happen when they were gone or when we were in an argument. Mad cleaning is great, you get so much done in a short period of time.If you are diagnosed with something, obviously that's a bit different.\n\nI said a very general statement based on my own experiences. Everyone has to take personal accountability for their own household work.\n\nMost things can be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.My house is available for anyone wanting to kick down a door and do some cleaning.  I'll sit there and occasionally say \"oh no... please stop... don't\" as you organize my laundry.  When you're done and a good 30 minutes away, *then* I'll call the PD and report the break in.Bacon and eggs? I love that!I had always heard the advice to just force yoursekf to do a bit of the task, just a start. But it never worked for me.  A piece that clicked for me is the idea that by doing the one teeny tiny inconsequential task, you are building up a new habit, the habit of attending to things.\n\n\n\nWhen i focused on what was being done or accomplished literally, it seemed useless to do such a small piece. I am a big procrastinator and i would look at the teeny tiny piece of the task and think, well, that wont do anything for me, just having one dish clean, why bother. And i dont have the energy to do it all. So i do nothing.\n\nBut when i think about \"hey, me doing the one dish doesnt fix much, but it does help me build a new habit. The habit where i do things in a timely manner. That habit makes it easier next time to get off my ass. \n\nIt isnt the dishes i am trying to accomplish anymore, it is the new habit i am trying to build, and for that goal, every teeny tiny little bit of progress really does in fact make a difference, because it is making easier to do the same next time.\n\nIt has helped me a bunch this year with my procrastination.Good advice. I find it hard to get started, so I say to myself \"do 30 minutes and then you can stop\". Sometimes I don't stop.This sounds so helpful! Thank you for sharingThank you for sharing. Small steps like these can snowball into a much better life <3I don't cycle either.I don't remember showing up?my neck looks like a VAGINACorn!?!  I didn\u2019t have any CORN!r/thatsthejokeEnd that cycle man! It's hard work, but you *can* do it!\n\nTalk to people that will support you, make a plan, set boundaries with people and within your own life.\n\nMost important though is seeking help, it's not something you should do alone. Personally, I tried everything and the only thing that stuck was AA. It gave me a sense of personal responsibility, and the meetings are basically group therapy. If you're not religious, (I'm not) that's fine too.\n\nI highly recommend downloading the Pink Cloud app and checking out a meeting. If it's not for you, leave and no harm no foul. But if you *really* want to quit, you'll get out as much as you put in with AA.\n\nEdit: A lot of negative responses about AA here, I know its not for everyone, but big part of it is finding a group that works for you. I'm agnostic, and I found a group of younger people that just focus on recovery. It just doesnt sound like the people responding did their homework. That's why I recommend downloading the PinkCloud app, it's a free way to see what kind of meeting are available around you. If you dont want to get religious, dont. If you dont want to participate beyond going to the meetings, that's fine too.\n\nAs long as we're getting anecdotal, I hated my experience at r/stopdrinking. The power tripping mods care more about rules than helping people.I\u2019m the words of my mom: It\u2019s easier to make the bed when you\u2019re still in itThat's a quick way to stop doing either chore because the new combo-chore is too big.But see.. after I do one chore I reward myself with a beer.My depression comes from coming.\n\n*wait*Get edibles?A diagnosis absolutely made a miraculous change with all 3 of my kids.  They went from hating school and getting average to less than average grades to loving school and getting straight A's\n\nIt's getting diagnosed more now because mental health and diagnosis is much more socially accepted.  Parents avoided having conversations with doctors, teachers, and caregivers that lead to diagnosis out of shame and embarrassment.  As well, those doctors, teachers, and caregivers are less afraid to bring it up to parents not wanting to offend them.Good point. I only have a girlfriend, which is considerably less than two kids and an animal.They're onto meWell with my friends we just do chores together.\nIt's nice to have company and the chores get done faster so we can get back to doing fun stuff together.Well it would make me uncomfortable to be living in a place like that so it wouldn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m talking about whether there\u2019s dishes on the sink etc.Honestly dirty dishes don't bother me as I used to be a dishwasher, but I was referring to my roommate not wanting to show they actually lived there, especially to someone who lives with them and knows what they're like. They once apologized for not doing the dishes from lunch when I got back in the evening.  \n\nNo judgement, but if you're having trouble aiming when you pee, you should probably talk to a medical professional. There might be an issue like an enlarged prostate or extra skin where there shouldn't be any affecting things.Personally I don't like doing that, it just kinda feels like lying to me and I want to be as honest as possible in my relationships.I'll lease you mine for $30 an hour. I'm paying you, of course. Do you know CPR?Just borrow them from your neighbours they won\u2019t notice and you don\u2019t have to tell them. You\u2019re welcome for this sage adviceFrom what I have seen, a lot of people do not differentiate between self respect, self esteem, self worth and confidence. If you put all of them in the same bag, you will get mixed reactions. \n\nEveryone can pick a psychiatry book or simply google side effects of low self respect. The downvote is not due to rational reasons (there aren\u2019t any real arguments against it); it is an emotional response (people feel attacked and don\u2019t self reflect well). To be fair, it does not make the downvoting less valid. Reason does does not always trump emotions. But in this case, it seems to be a natural reaction of a depressed person (which Reddit has plenty off).Well Mr bacon burger here is awesome. The username does check out,Furst impurressions meowterThank you :)That\u2019s actually a solid way to look at it.I've always explained it as having 150% attention span. So if I'm sitting up straight and focussing the other 50% starts looking for things to do and gets you distracted.\n\nOnce the 50% is doodling/fidgeting/whatever then the other 100% can focus without getting distracted.Oh my gosh my teacher used to take my pencils because I would doodle during class, it was torture.\n\nI also doodle during meetings now but at the end my boss and coworkers enjoy looking to see what I drew after the meeting ends, lolI\u2019ve become over time what I think of as a \u201cfunctioning\u201d person. Instead of doodling which can be distracting for others I have this set of magnets that I can constantly flip inside and out in different ways, I highly recommend giving them a try. Anything small that\u2019s not distracting to others, doesn\u2019t need to be looked at while using, and can be kept in your hand/pocket is helpful.I had the exact same experience. The teachers kept disciplining me for \"not paying attention\" even though I had perfect grades. Luckily my mom went to the school administration and went apeshit on them until they stopped.I just wanna pop in here and agree with you, fuck people.My 5 year old sings while I read to him. Still hears and remembers EVERYTHING. But I have to stop him because I can\u2019t focus on reading while he sings/hums lightly.I was forced to write with my right hand in school. I'm a lefty and was writing with my left hand. I was kicked out of 2nd grade and had to go to a different school because the teacher and principle needed me to write with my right hand. Good ridden 80sI had an awesome Earth Science teacher in Highschool. I would always doodle and he noticed. As class was packing up one day he had a little one-on-one with me about my doodling he noticed. He was concerned I wasn't paying attention but my grades showed I was. After explaining to him about how it helped me listen, he was skeptical but allowed it as long as I maintained a grade above 90 on my assignments. Eventually he even started asking to check out my doodles because he thought some of them were cool and my grades were keeping up. I don't think he understands how those things made his students respect him so much more than other teachers.\n\nAnother good story was when a student jokingly challenged him to a 1-on-1 Call of Duty match to improve his grade on a test. The mad lad of a teacher brings his Xbox and some soda to class the next day and accepts the challenge and just wipes the floor with the student in COD. Turns out he played a lot of it in his free time and none of us expected that. Dude was an awesome Earth Science teacher and really knew how to build a connection with his students.Ok, so, just a head's up- you can't sue them for discriminating against your medical condition if they don't know you have it. You would first need to make sure it's documented in your employee record and then they can't just say they didn't know, and why didn't you say so in the first place. That's why many companies encourage self-disclosing disabilities and certain conditions. \n\nNow, there's a flip side to that, because some people feel that this gives the company the opportunity to discreetly discriminate against them in roundabout ways that essential force them to quit or the company has another reason to fire them while technically not doing anything illegal. So it really depends on your manager and your company culture.I'm a teacher and in this same boat. I used to get in trouble for \"not paying attention\". Now? I actively allow doodling. It's quiet and much less likely to distract others than a lot of other stims people can use to focus. I also get really pretty worksheets!\n\nI doodle during staff meetings. Church is the best, though, because I sit with the kids and color, and I actually can focus on the sermon!Putting things in places and forgetting where they are is also an adhd trait.Damn that's a pretty severe case, I feel sorry for the dude since I have it a bit and it does put one down.[deleted]Agreed! I've never really heard anyone else talk about this, but I am an angry cleaner for sure. When I get mad and start cleaning it really helps lower my stress/anger level AND I  get more done so quickly. One of my friends used to joke that he could tell if I was pissed because of the way I would clean \ud83e\udd23I don\u2019t disagree in a general sense; I just wasn\u2019t sure how your statement was intended from the context, so I felt the need to elaborate.I like this perspective. I'm trying to exercise but I hate it so I'm starting with 5 minutes on the row machine at a time (all I can do so far! And not including time stretching.). I figure I can slowly increase the time I'm able to do it and eventually it might be a real workout - but it still sucks. \n\nI like thinking of it more like I'm building the habit of 'deciding to exercise' instead of feeling shame I can't yet get past a measly 5 min... Then maybe it'll help me make that decision more often - just to build the habit - no pressure on how long I'm doing the thing I decided to do.Your 30 minutes is my 15. I set a soothing timer and allow no interruptions. When the timer goes off, I reset it and do exactly what I want. And repeat this action over and over again until my place looks acceptable again (or when I get too tired). It works for me.Got a stationary bike farming dust bunnies. I suppose it's benevolent to the bunnies.Some steroids would probably help me feel a little better tbh. /sYou're here right now!I've got more chins than a Chinese phone book!Im not a fan of aa because the religious connection. \n\nNot a fan of /r/stopdrinking either bc one of the mods shit on me for literally asking for a way for myself and a good friend to support each other stop drinking when both wanted to... So apparently mutual friend support is limited to randos saying iwndwyt on the internet and not friends you've known over a quarter century\n\nSmartrecovery is what I go to. As well as a local group and some booksThis line of thinking is how I fail supposedly easy college courses. Instead of doing assignments across the week, I'd do them in groups, but that's not being efficient, it just builds unnecessary stress. Especially don't combine financial responsibilities with something you don't want to do because that's how I learned late fees can be more expensive than the actual bill.Double the chores, double the beers. It's a win-win.You\u2019re probably joking, but that\u2019s a slippery slope.Much better than rewarding yourself with a chore after doing a chore.Exactly.My coming cleans from depressionNo, no. It checks out.I\u2019ve tried some chocolates and noticed nothingThose hair spiders in the bathroom though ...Trying to avoid this woman is the plagueIf I'm gonna ask my friends to spend time with me I wouldn't waste it on choresYa me too my house is permanently spotlessNah just ignore it and do a sit down wee. Problem solved then.It\u2019s difficult to aim straight with a rock hard erectionYeah, of course I know CPR, who doesn't? But just so we're clear, what do *you* mean by CPR?As good as that sounds, u/penguinina_666 is offering me money for theirs so I'll take that offerAbsolutely stealing thisDo they make noise when you move them? As someone with misophonia and anxiety repetitive noises can be incredibly distracting.\n\nSchools used to give each student a peppermint before standardized tests because it was supposed to boost concentration or something. So people like me spent the first 15-20 minutes of the test working so hard to block out all of the mouth noises cause by a room full of just slurping on a peppermint that we were already mentally exhausted before we really got started. Then there were of course the couple that saved it and started slurping and hour in. \n\nThen the fidget tools became popular and the constant clicking, whooshing, tapping, clanking, etc. made it impossible to focus. \n\nSo, I ask if they are quiet because I\u2019d like to have an option to share with people when the situation arises. Cheers.That sounds interesting. Do you have a link to the product perhaps?I honestly don't care about being a functioning adult. I like to knit. I have business meetings and during the bigger ones I tend to knit to keep myself occupied because I need to do something with my hands or I will start to play on my phone or I'll end up falling asleep. It's not a good look. So I can get away with knitting.I thankfully had the exact opposite experience. I would doodle in class and I even would knit in class and my teachers never said anything. Once I found a deck of cards in a math class and started playing solitaire. These other guys in class got in trouble for being disruptive and they mentioned me playing cards in the corner and the teacher told them they could play cards when they had an A average. I think it was a combination of teacher lottery and me knowing which classes I could do that shit in.I feel like you need a hug. <here's a digital one ifit'snotweirdanddoesn'tviolateanyboundariesthaI'mnotawareof>Thanks for the heads up. \n\nAs far as I know it's documented in my employee record. Will check tomorrow to make sure tho. \n\nMy manager is a narcissistic psychopath, or something like that. She most definitely will \"find\" a reason that she co-created. She's done that to others in the last 3 years. She tried to get rid of me too, also hoping that I would give up and quit.... Knowing she's still sneakily laying nails in front of me, I'm walking around partially paranoid most of the time.Especially forgetting where they are *immediately after*Thinking is also a trait commonly found in people with adhd.They don't want you to help, bro. They want you to be there as their friend, to talk to them and bullshit about life, the things you guys have been doing.\n\nIf your friendship is worth so little that you can't even spend time with your friend without constant high-tier engagement of digital activity, or something YOU PERSONALLY want to do, then this friendship you're talking about is less about being there for your friend and more about you wanting to always be benefiting from your 'friendship.'\n\nYou strike me as the kind of person who wouldn't text me for a year, but the moment a mutual mentions my new pool, I suddenly hear from you in the summer months.I'm beginning to exercise as well, and one way I've found to motivate myself is to listen to audiobooks while doing it. I find it much easier to decide to listen to the book than it is to decide to exercise, and since I can't really just sit there and listen while doing nothing then I may as well start walking or whatever.Exactly, even if you dont workout much at all, you got your gear on, you got youself there and ready to go, and now, that makes it a little easier next time and the time after that. \n\nI'm cheering you on across the internet!One thing that helped me was music and starting with things I enjoyed. I needed to work on strength but enjoyed cardio, I found just dance videos on YouTube and got into following the dances then moved onto actual dance workouts and found trainers online I liked and did their dance videos and moved into their strength training videos while playing my own music so I was still getting the dopamine boost of my favorite music while just feeling like I was working out with a friend.In my family we had killer dust bunnies. I learned just to leave them be.I sometimes wonder if a stationary bike would be good for me. The thing that stops me from working out is my body wanting nicotine. I don\u2019t vape until after work so usually by the time I get home it\u2019s been 20 hours since I\u2019ve had nicotine but if I vape my body will think it\u2019s time to rest. If it\u2019s not my vape I want to read, I can\u2019t do either while doing my main workouts but I can do it while on an indoor bike or a walk but walking is kinda out of the question since I switched shifts and get home at 1 in the morning. If I\u2019m not worried about getting snatched up by a rando then I\u2019m worried about the lack of sidewalks and my safety vest not being enough to alert cars to someone on the side of the street.Ah fuck how'd I get here\n\n###what did you do to meI don\u2019t know what your specific situation was, nor do I know what this mod said to you, but I can understand urging caution against getting sober \u201cwith\u201d someone else because of the potential for enabling and codependency, which can be masked or rationalized as support and understanding. Regardless, I\u2019m glad you found what works for you. I am also not an AA person because of the heavy religious themes and general structure/underlying presuppositions, but I\u2019m 7+ months sober and keeping strong and steady.Also chiming in to say that Smart Recovery is a better option. AA is really culty. It is religiously based, and people will straight harass you if you give them your phone number (they'll want to trade numbers). I'm not saying this happens all the time, every time, but it sure happens often enough. Then there's all the \"13th stepping\" (older abusers who take advantage of vulnerable new people, it's so common it has a well-known name). Another AA issue is Judges send all sorts of people involved in the criminal system to meetings as part of pretrial release and parole. So you're in there sharing your deepest darkest secrets with some guy who turns out to be a violent felon, sex offender, or an identity thief, etc. People think there's some sort of confidentiality about meetings. There isn't. At all. Btw r/stopdrinking is a great community for people looking for support and resources to quit drinking. It can be done. It isn't as hard as you think. You can do it. Anybody reading this, I promise you you can get over booze addiction. \n\nFor anyone interested, here are two massively helpful books.\n\n*This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace and *Alcohol Explained* by William Porter.That's unusual, whether you like them or not you should notice *something.*Get better edibles? \ud83d\ude09You know what? Doesn't matter. I'll be back in 4 hours.They sort of depend on how the person uses them. They do have the potential for making noise, but only if they click together quickly. If you don\u2019t want them to make noise, they won\u2019t, but it\u2019s totally up to how the user plays with them.Definitely productive! I\u2019d love to have a meeting with someone and get a knit hat at the end ;)I've read a book in class and the teacher just told me she'd borrow it when I'm done. Sadly, she was the only teacher in that school, who rewarded thinking over obedience.Thinking is also a trait commonly found in things that think.[deleted]I had quit. He had not. Was trying to help him but also struggling and figured we could help each other and might find ways.\n\nWe are not codependent by any means\n\nEdit: figured we could help one another like all the other groups but more personally but I got a big middle finger when walking about stopping drinking to a sub that's about itIt's actually not super uncommon. Quite a few people lack the enzyme to digest THC properly, first time I got my best friend high I gave him about 30mg of edibles and he didn't feel a thing.I mean I've been handwashing dishes for a decade, and never once was I so stupid that I couldn't figure out that, when I'm talking to a friend, I work a bit more carefully to simply not make gigantic amounts of noise, even when washing large cookware!\n\nYou are seriously backpedaling as hard as you can from \"Lol I'd be pissed if you did that\" to \"Nah I love talking to people who do dishes!\"I don't like AA because all my sponsors have been overbearing \"I want to be a sponsor because it validates me\"\n\nI've found a month of AA coupled with therapy works better than using AA as a \"sober solution\".\n\nBecause you \"check in\" with someone(neutral party) who you actually PAY to listen to you. (Therapist) Rather than listen to \"the book\" from someone who most likely has the same background as you.\n\nBTW I LOVE therapy...  It's challenging and there is a HUGE barrier to overcome until you \"actually\" open up in both cases.  But if you're there every Tuesday at 1pm?  It's more structure because they'll miss out on revenue if they're not there.\n\nBut if AA works for you?  Good on you.  Therapy works for me.>I had quit. He had not.\n\nOne of the subreddit rules is that people have to be sober when they post. Otherwise it turns into a free-for-all. r/drunk is where you want to go if you want to have drunk booze related discussions. There may be another subreddit that allows posts from people under the influence, I don't know what it is though.You gave someone 30mg of edibles for their first time getting high?That's why he didn't feel anything. 30 mgs isn't much. 150 mgs is a lot. 30 mgs ya wouldn't feel anything.[deleted]Smartrecovery, USARA, diverting hobbies to change lifestyle, and some books\n\nAll free minus the hobby and book cost, but you can probably find the books at a library or free audio book\u2026 the sober guy was the one posting.Sorry I should have been more specific. We started with 5mg, then after a few hours we started building from there. It was around 30mg in total.Yeah that sounds terrifying. If I take a 30mg edible as someone who ingest thc semi-regularly, it's a 50/50 chance I'm either calm and relaxed or having a panic attack*first time I got my best friend high*\n\n*30mg*\n\nBruhThis is bad advice. If you're new, start slow. There are people that *need* 150 mg just to feel it (I am one) because of genetics, but there are just as many that would be out of their gourds at 30. Play safe.Ignorant take, 10-15 is *plenty* for most first time and infrequent users",

    "Comments": "This is a friendly reminder to [read our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/rules).\n\nRemember, /r/Showerthoughts is for showerthoughts, not \"thoughts had in the shower!\"\n\n(For an explanation of what a \"showerthought\" is, [please read this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/wiki/overview).)\n\n**Rule-breaking posts may result in bans.**>no one talks about how much better life is since banning indoor public smoking\n\nWe did, but it's been so long now (at least in CA) that there's an entire generation of adults now who never experienced the world with indoor smoking. So it's just not something that really comes to mind now.The weeks after indoor smoking was banned was horrible in bars and pubs. You realised how much smoke covered the smell of stale beer and body odour.Balkans are laughing ( and coughing at the same time) right nowI\u2019m fairness we don\u2019t talk much about how good things are without smallpox either.As a drummer in a bar, on a stage, on a drum riser, at the highest elevation of anyone in the establishment,  good god did I appreciate the change.I remember meals would be ruined at a restaurant when the table next to you would light up a cigarette.\n\nCloths would reek of smoke after leaving a bowling alley.\n\nCars and planes would have ashtrays in the armrest that were always disgusting.I am so grateful I live in a time you can\u2019t just smoke anywhere. The smell of smoke is awful to me. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like for people with conditions like asthmaI was watching Mrs. Doubtfire with my son and in the scene near the end where the host at the restaurant asked \"Smoking or non-smoking?\" my son asked me what the guy was taking about.\n\nMy son has never in his life known what a smoking section was.I talk about this from time to time. I even remember where the smoking section was in some restaurants. (At McDonalds in my town you had to walk through the smoking section to get to the bathroom - very poorly thought out.) \n\nThere are still some places in the US where smoking is permitted indoors, and it\u2019s always jarring to be in one of those places - for example, in Nevada (or Las Vegas, at least), it\u2019s permitted in bars that don\u2019t serve food.Fun fact indoor smoking is not federally regulated and all smoking bans are on a state level. 12 states do not have any restrictions to indoor smoking.My wife has asthma and cigarette smoke can aggravate it. We'd always ask for non-smoking tables. Sometimes, you'd need to walk through the smoking section to get to the non-smoking section. \n\nOther times, the dividing line was imaginary. The table next to you was in the smoking section and they'd light up. The smoke would never just drift over to the non-smoking section. NEVER! (Always.)\n\nI love that you don't need to worry about inhaling those fumes anymore when you go out.I appreciate it beyond words. Although there was already a downward trend, I have to think that the ban on indoor public smoking was an inflection point for the diminishing likelihood of addiction to smoking. I\u2019m not sure I personally know and have contact with anyone who smokes today. It was not so 50 years ago, when 80% of my friends, acquaintances, and all random strangers I met were smokers.\n\nA true story of change: twelve years ago I was taking both my sons, then a high school freshman and junior, on a last round of the college road-trips that had so occupied us for the preceding two years. On that trip one of our stops was at Oberlin, which I found highly impressive. My younger son\u2019s comment was, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to this school; everyone here smokes.\u201d This came towards the end of our time on campus, his comment occasioned by our passing the _fourth_ student we had seen smoking as she crossed in front of us, hurrying to class.\n\nHe had never indicated that this might be one of his criteria at any of the fifteen or more schools he had visited at that point, but we had never before seen so many smokers at one school, either.I remember getting in an argument with someone at the time when our state was voting on banning smoking in bars. She was convinced that would be the end of the bar scene, and that liquor sales would be crippled. That the only reason people buy alcohol was because cigarettes made them thirsty.\n\nI felt dumber walking away from her that day, and my faith in humanity had been lowered.I still talk about it all the time. I worked in a night club when the ban came in to effect here and my life got 1000% better from that day onwardsI have tried to describe it to my child. I can't communicate how nasty it could be.  There was one restaurant my parents liked when I was a kid and refused to go by about 9 years old because it smelled so bad and made my nose run and my throat sore .As someone with allergies and family with asthma: **so much better**I remember one of the last times I went out before the smoking ban, it was a bar downstairs from the entrance, so no windows or doors. Just a big vent in the middle of the room. The smoke was so bad my eyes stung and watered the whole time.\n\nNot to mention that we STANK the next day, and our group wasn't smoking.\n\nI'm so glad it's not a thing anymore.Remember how all the bars were going to go out of business because of this communist plot to control us?I think it's because it's been so much longer. I'm almost 30, my sister's in her 40s and neither of us remember a time when smoking indoors (other than in casinos) was allowed. But we both remember a time without the internet (at least easy access) and cell phones. I guess I remember when restaurants had smoking sections, but they were always patio/outdoor seating.I remember as a kid going to Luby\u2019s and the smoking section was separated by a 2\u2019 divider between the booths. I didn\u2019t understand how that stopped the smoke and that\u2019s because it didn\u2019t! \ud83d\ude37The GenZs at work barely believe me when I say, as a Millennial, that people could smoke in pubs and clubs right up until I went to Uni. The ones that smoke though always look like they wish it was still a thing and I'm so fucking glad it isn't. I literally avoided social gathering because of my asthma. Ridiculous.I certainly do, especially working in a hotel where the most disgusting people walk in asking if they have a smoking room. \n\nNo sir, we are a no smoking facility and so is every hotel in the state. Please don\u2019t smoke in my hotel or I won\u2019t hesitate to hit you with the smoking fee that you sign for and acknowledge even though you\u2019ll cry about that you didn\u2019t know. Now please go away because you smoke Oder is giving me a migraine.As a GenXer, I grew up driving around town with my grandparents chain smoking with the windows up while I\u2019m desperately holding back my nausea. We\u2019ve come a long wayUnless you have an apartment upstairs: pub visitors smoke outside the pub now.I was fairly young when this changed, but I still remember how disappointed I\u2019d be when my dad (not a smoker) would accept a table in the smoking section of a restaurant to avoid having to wait. I also remember embarrassing my mom once in some waiting room by pulling my shirt up over my mouth and nose when a guy in the room lit a cigarette.Best decision ever! As a non smoker this is something I am eternally grateful for.I was talking about this the other day, my asthma has been incredibly better since this!\n\nIn my teens I worked as a bingo caller, by the end of the night, you wouldn't be able to see the ceiling of the place! \n\nThe law changed while I was there, everyone was outraged. I was relieved!Strange how everyone was so up in arms about smoking cigarettes but don\u2019t seem to care at all about the constant inhalation of car exhaust. I have a feeling that once combustion engines are banned(20-30 years) we\u2019ll be talking about how nobody talks about how great getting rid of car pollution was.I wasn't around for it so it's like another world seeing pictures of people smoking in the birth ward or hospitals in general as it's such an ingrained \"big no-no\" now.Because those two things are completely unrelated.\n\nThat's like saying \"Everyone knows computers have gotten faster as the years have gone by, but no one is talking about how suicide rates have gone down \"Ireland saw new cases of heart disease drop by 1/3rd in the year after they banned pub smoking.Well I live in Turkey so there's nothing to talk about. Sometimes they crack a window though, which is nice.Yes we do. We talk about how we used to come home from a night out and absolutely stunk. How we\u2019d have to let our clothes air out and there was truly no difference between the smoking and non smoking sections of a restaurant\u2026or a planeI rarely went to bars, simply because I didn't fit in. I would only go if a bunch of people I knew were going and they specifically invited me.\n\nOne night, I got home to my asthmatic wife. She couldn't go near me, and told me to shower before I came to bed. \"Whatever,\" I thought, and cleaned up.\n\nThe next morning, I got a whiff of the clothes I wrote the night before. I was *appalled*. I didn't go to another bar for years until they finally banned smoking indoors. I really had no idea how bad it was until that \"morning after the night before\".It was a trade off. Instead of smoking, everyone's just fat now. I'm convinced the two are correlatedI distinctly remember as a child going to visit my elderly relative in hospital and there was a bespoke smoking room where everyone had to go to smoke and it was basically a glass walled room where the smoke was so thick you could barely see\u2026. You would always see elderly men and women on a drip sat there smoking, it was crazy looking back.Also\u2026there were some badass ashtrays! My granny had one in her tiny Queens apartment that was a little cottage with a chimney - you could rest your cigarette in the door of the cottage, and smoke would come out the chimney. Plus, plastic on the sofa, a mid-century china cabinet with dishes no one ever used, and a brass bowl with hard fruit candies that nobody liked but ate anyway.Oh we did a lot. It's just that it was a pretty long time ago for many places around the world.\n\nWe also don't talk about when we removed lead from gasoline.Why would you say ' internet and iphones'? Shouldn't it be \"internet and smartphones\"?Because smokers still smell like a nasty ashtray whether they're smoking or not .When I was little, I'd go to the bowling alley with my gramps, who was in a league. Everyone there smoked. And for whatever reason, that specific smokey bowling alley smell is a good memory, probably because I got to spend time with gramps. But as an adult, I am now very grateful that I didn't have to endure that any more than I did, and that future generations won't have to deal with it at all. \n\nTimes change, people learn, and we work to get better at taking care of each other.It\u2019s amazing! Noooo comparison to how it was before.\n\nNow I\u2019d just like outdoor smoking to be banned in restaurants. I hate sitting outside and suddenly someone starts smoking next to you.Next on the list is fake service animals. \nYour dog barking at everyone walking by is not your service animals and is not allowed.Smoking in my local dive rn. Might be the last place within 100 miles that allows it.As a former heavy smoker, THANK FUCK!\n\nEven when I was chainsmoking 2 packs a day I HATED going to bars and music venues just choked out with smoke.\n\nHonestly I don't even know how non-smokers even went to those places back when you could smoke indoors.\n\nThe last time I went to a bar where you could smoke inside was a couple years ago and we went just for like the reminiscence of it as my group of friends were all smokers.... we lasted one drink before we left.I'm a singer and recently played a gig in a bar that found a loophole in the city's laws. If they had a humidor they could sell cigars and allow people to smoke in the building. It sucked so bad. My throat hurt for two days. People who were dancing said their throats hurt. My clothes still smell days later.We all talk how cars are better than walking but no one is talking about how round wheels are better than square wheelsLife is way better without indoor smoking. Even more offensive was the whole idea of a \u201csmoking section\u201d in a plane or restaurant.I\u2019m in Austria so it hasn\u2019t been all that long since it happened and I do still talk about it because thank goodness. \n\nAlso in Austria it was funny how it finally came into law. The government had been going back and forth on it for quite a while when there was a huge scandal related to one of the FP\u00d6 guys getting caught essentially being willing to sell out information to what he thought was a Russian. \n\nThe entire government was dissolved and until the election could happen they put in an intermum government body of experts to run the ship. \n\nExperts who didn\u2019t care about tobacco lobbying vote buyers. They put through the no smoking ban and the air has been much clearer since. \n\nSmoking bans are not a popularity issue. They are at their core a health issue, and one that effects other people.I am old enough to remember being able smoke on airplanes, in restaurants and anywhere that was public with out a care for anyone around you.I'll never forget ash trays at the endcaps of grocery store isles.Idk how long this has been wherever you're from. But as a 21+ year old I've never experienced this in Australia.As a German I'm fucking jealous. Here the bans only exist in theory. There are either loopholes or places outright ignore it.I miss the aesthetic of the smoke-filed bar.\n\nI'm an exsmoker and I'm glad they banned it indoors. I'm just saying, the smoke-filled bar was a different animal.I honestly miss it. I miss smoking in general. I get way less breaks at work now, I don't have an easy social excuse to leave for a few minutes, it's harder to meet people at parties because smoking let you chat in smaller groups. I've made a ton of friends on the patio. I do like my lungs the way they are but I definitely miss smokingI remember being so pissed off about that! Damn was I wrong lolI don\u2019t smoke but it never really bothered me when it was allowedHear me out please. I'm a smoker. Just like how the \"indoor smoking\" is something an entire generation doesn't know about, why can we not do for all \"smoking\" as well? If they never can buy cigarettes (let's say people born in or after 2023), they'll not get addicted and soon \"smoking\" will by itself be history.Some of us miss it in a nostalgic way. \n\nI'm 41 and still remember Sunday mornings at Village Inn with my parents and sister starting with a the hostess asking my dad \"smoking or non?\"\n\nHad more than a few babysitters that were moms that smoked indoors and in the car. \n\nparties our parents would take us to where all the kids stayed downstairs but sometimes wandered upstairs for food and had to make their way through a cloud of cigarette and weed smoke. \n\nAs a teenager, my friends and I would chill at Perkins after a late movie drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. it was $1.29 a cup for a bottomless pot. \n\nAround the same time, I spent a good amount of time in a certain pool hall shooting and smoking and playing arcade games. Sometimes there was a fight. That was fun. \n\nIn high school, as a member of the marching band, we did fundraisers where the students and parents ran a bingo hall two nights a week. The bingo hall was always divided between smoking and non, but the smoking section always had the most guests and was closest to the pickle bar. \n\nI also remember the band director catching us smoking on school grounds and almost pulling our tongues out through our assholes. \n\nYeah, man... good times.I get why it happened. But businesses should have been allowed to opt into smoking only. Like bars. \n\nA complete ban, like they did in Minnesota, ruined a lot of businesses. People don't want to go outside to smoke in Minnesota winter.\n\nBoth my parents worked in the bar industry and yeah that smoking ban ruined us financially.As an old person who remembers the transition: yeah it\u2019s better, but it was never more than a minor inconvenience. You\u2019re overthinking it, OP.as an asthmatic, it's been wonderful!\n\nyour addiction/poor choices are not my issue.Well where I live that's been the case for 25+ years.   After the first five years or so it seemed kinda pointless to keep yammering on about itA few of my older coworkers (nurses may I add) still dreamily tell me about ye good olden days when they would smoke at the nurses station during shift change, break or charting. According to them, that was when everything started to go downhill.Still an issue on cruise ships smoking in the casino. We won\u2019t even walk through the area, let alone sit in there.There\u2019s a bar in my town callled MUGS and it allows indoor smoking of cigarettes, it was a weird experience for my 21 year old selfGrew up in the 80s, and I remember my parents coming home from being out somewhere and smelling like smoke and food and alcohol and perfume/cologne. I didn\u2019t know what it all meant at the time, but I loved that smell\u2026it was so intriguing and mysterious.Oh man. In high school in the late 90s I worked at the snack counter of the bingo hall owned by my local Boys & Girls Club as a fundraiser for our marching band. \n\nIt was one of the few places in my state where it was still socially acceptable to smoke indoors (along with the Indian casinos) and man you could cut the air with a butter knife. Couldn\u2019t see the far side of the room through the haze. It was really really awful, and it triggered my asthma so badly that I had to cut my shift short, never to return. \n\nIt was a really depressing place with a bunch of old ladies double fisting both the bingo dobbers and the chain-smoked cigarettes while working a half dozen or more cards.As a musician who played bars before the smoking ban I can tell you it made my life so much better. My equipment used to get so disgusting.The nostalgia of watching people eat in the smoking chamber of ihop\u2026 one hand pancakes.. the other Marlboro. Fucking GROSSWe used to smoke cigarettes behind the gym at high school (1994) \n\nNo one cared but it wasn\u2019t really allowedAn entire generation that hasn't seen a burger king or McDonald's ash tray. Joe Camel and the Marlboro man around every corner, free matchbooks at every convenience store, restaurant and hotel.We talked about it at work the other day while we were outside smoking.I remember smoking at dennys at 3am in the smokers section drinking coffee and eating pancakes to work off the alcohol.  This was like 2006.  It\u2019s amazing how far we\u2019ve come in the past two decades - from a person in their mid (late?) 30s who remembers well.After almost a decade I\u2018ve been to a club last weekend where smoking was allowed. It was absolutely horrible.People must have smelled so bad all the time and didn\u2019t even know itProbably partially because the two are completely unrelated. Like not even close to each other. \n\n\"Man, the age of the internet has drastically changed the world around us.\" \n\n\"Yeah, like, remember when people would smoke indoors?\"Legit had this discussion today, I remember when you could smoke in the mallWe used to sit at Denny\u2019s for hours, chain smoking reds and drinking coffee.  \n\nGod I miss it.  \n\nBut it is definitely for the best that kids aren\u2019t doing that anymore.I want to open a cannabis lounge but this law has fucked any notion of that too unfortunately. Washington stateMy friends and I talk about it quite often.  Even as former smokers things are so much better now.\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d he said in a low, raspy voice as he vigorously rolled the butt of his half burnt pall mall around in is yellow, nicotine stained fingers.I don't know how this changed since 2018, but [here's a map of states without a statewide indoor smoking ban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smoking_bans_in_the_United_States).\nI lived in one of these states, in a place where there wasn't a county ban on indoor smoking, and my coworkers chain-smoked in the office. I have severe asthma and ultimately had to leave the job, which I wasn't terribly upset about because they sucked for other reasons, too.It was so bad. Flying in the 90\u2019es, the back of the plane was for smokers. Just a thick fog of smoke, and of course my, smoking, family wanted to sit there, because fuck kids with Asthma. \nTrains? Every second car\u2026 hold your breath as you walk through to find a seat (only available seats were often in the smoking section since even to smokers it was nasty.Solid! I quit 25 years ago and now I can't stand the smell the mess the risk of fire or anything about it!I remember at the same time my parents were teaching me how to order off a menu and tip the waitress, they also taught me to ask every time for a nonsmoking table and ask whether the sections had walls separating them.\nThank goodness it\u2019s been near a decade and a half since I\u2019ve had to ask that.In the UK, it's awesome not coming home from the pub and needing to wash all of my clothes.[deleted]I\u2019m a smoker and I think about it quite a bit. Believe it not I\u2019m glad I can\u2019t smoke inside anymore.What blows my mind is that they used to let people smoke on a fucking PLANE.A good deal of people are angry about that. There right to smoke seems to override peoples right to breath easy and comfortably.Anywhere I've done it smoking inside was pretty great. If smoking didn't give you cancer I'd be smoking right now.I think that\u2019s because life is *different* because of iPhone, but not *better*. Whereas life is definitively better because of indoor smoking being gone.Still a major issue with most of Berlin's bars and clubs. I was shocked that we (rightfully) give Germany so much credit for progressive policies and yet they're still choking on smoke everywhere one guy lights up. It was particularly strange during the COVID rules, because they were extremely mask-wearing and hygienic UNLESS someone wanted to chain smoke at the table next to you and blow their smokey aerosols everywhere. Jarring.I was a smoker when the ban came in the UK. Good I was so mad about. What the fuck was I thinking. Everywhere is so much nicer now it doesn't stick of cigarettes. Although, not gonna lie, the immediate aftermath of every bar fucking reeking of stale beer and puke untill they realised they needed to actually clean the place was grim.And now we have vapers who believe these rules don't apply to them.Unpopular opinion. But  society was held hostage to the whims of the smoking class so they can enjoy their cigarettes, to the detriment of nonsmokers and children \n\nToday in America  society is held hostage to the whims of the gun nut class so they can enjoy their weapons, to the detriment of everyone including childrenI remember being diagnosed with asthma and needing an inhaler at the age of like 9 (luckily it's gone now it was respiratory issues caused by such high amounts of second hand smoke) because my mum smoked in the house and so did all her friends and I'd get dragged to the local pub. I'd try spend most of my time in the play area with other kids. If u had to go indoors for something it was literally like entering a smoke cloud there was no normal air indoors in a pub it was straight up abusive and I can't believe nobody even questioned it soonerOh I do. My parents are smokers so we always say in the smoking sections and it was hell.Jeez, I hate people who say iphones instead of just phones, thats like saying samsungs and huaweisI\u2019m fine that they banned it in restaurants and airplanes and all that. But even though I\u2019m not a full time smoker any more, I miss separated smoking lounges at the airport (since you can\u2019t just go outside), and at bars.I\u2019m not going to lie I\u2019d rather be sent back in time where I could have a smoke at Eat n Park and everyone talked to each other instead of scrolling Twitter the entire time.Go to a casino in Vegas, it's a reminder of what it used to be like before smoking indoors was banned in most states. It's straight up disgusting.Unfortunately with the rise of vaping I\u2019m starting to see young people too casually vape in restaurants and public transit. Entitled pieces of shit.If you miss it, head over to the Capital. The House GOP has brought it back. Sadly, no /s here.People only really recognize a problem when there is one. It\u2019s difficult to tell when a problem has been solved on a large scale because usually that means you couldn\u2019t tell it was ever a problem to begin with. That\u2019s why learning from history is so important and the inverse dooms to repetition.\n\nEdit: imoMid 40s Canadian here\u2026 I can remember my first flights as a child people still smoked on planes. Was still allowed in bars/clubs until my early 20s\u2026 sooo glad that disgusting behaviour is not allowed nowI\u2019m from Canada and I more remember when they banned any smoking within 10 feet of a buildings entrance. You hardly see people smoking outside even, anymore.I still talk about it sometimes. The way you would smell when you got home after going to a bar or nightclub still haunts me.I was visibly pregnant in 1998. Whilst waiting for a bus, it began to rain, so I stepped into the bus shelter. Unfortunately, so did all the smokers. I couldn't breathe without getting a lung full of cigarette smoke. I decided it would be better for my baby for me to stand out in the pouring rain while waiting for the bus.It was one of the happiest days of my life. I HATE smoke with a vengeance.The disparity in mention correlates to the extent of each's impact I guess.Yes and please continue pushing and voting when possible to get the damn things banned completelyI was working in a bar when the smoking ban came in to force in NZ. My job prior to opning on the first day was to clean fixtures and fittings. I learned that they were white, not brown.I remember going on a tour of Grand Central Station in NYC when holidaying there with my parents, around 2003, and they showed the one square they left after cleaning the artwork on the ceilings after smoking was banned there. It's a black square! Always stuck with me, didn't stop me taking up smoking for a good ten years \ud83e\udee5Because we still had to read maps like Vasco Da Gama to find the mall in a new town, carry around bags of quarters like a cartoon bank robber to make phone calls, and look for office jobs walking up to buildings like DeNiro in King of ComedyUm, I was just talking about this the other day. I remember visiting relatives in the hospital and the waiting room would be filled with people just chuffing away on their Winstons or Virginia Slims or whatever. Blows my mind what kind of shit was allowed to go on.My first job was in a little indie record shop where we smoked behind the counter. I am so old. I do miss smoking in pubs though, even though it\u2019s nicer being in them now.You answeared that thought by yourself.\n\nEveryone talks about how things are \"different\".\n\nNoone talks about how things got \"better\".\n\nEveryone knows the saying \"Everything was better in the old days.\"\n\nThis is in part because especially nowadays with the internet and social media, wich tend to push negative news a lot more, but also because we naturally always look out for bad things that could or are happening to us, we mostly see all the bad stuff that is happening in the World.\n\nHowever there is a lot of studies that prove, that life got significantly better for everyone over the last few decades.\n\n...\n\nOkay maybe except north korea..\n\nIts basically our own psychology that is playing tricks on us, making us unsatisfied with our current conditions no matter how much better we already have it.\n\nThis is not a bad thing however, because it means humans generally will always strife forward and try to make things better than they are.\n\n(Mind you this is broad statistics over the last few decades and not for each individual or generation so.. pls stop typing that message how ukrainians rn have it worse than before.. that is not the point.. noone is saying 'everything' is better..)I'd rather have people smoking indoors but actually looking while driving.I\u2019m a non- smoker and it didn\u2019t bother me when people smoked indoors. It just seems like another type of segregation.I live in Japan, indoor smoking is allowed pretty much everywhere you would enjoy nightlife and it sucks.I\u2019m younger so I had no clue indoor public smoking was even a thing, mind blownI\u2019ve discussed it many times! You have to be in your mid 40s (in CA at least) to appreciate a couple years of life in a bar with smoke, then the change. The smell on your clothes the next day! Holy crap that was disgusting!I can only just remember when smoking was still allowed in restaurants; and I remember a lot of these places had \u201crenovations\u201d when smoking bans came into effect (more like they couldn\u2019t get the smoke smell out of their carpets and furniture)I gave up smoking 6 years ago.  Just the other day I was going to my apartment and my neighbor was smoking on her patio  as I passed I caught a lung full of her used smoke and I was gagging from the hellacious stink of it. It was an eye opener to think used to do that to myself on purpose.Indoor smoking created a lot of cool culture though. Denny\u2019s used to be the shit.This was a big deal in the 90\u2019s, now you can smoke weed indoors in NV. Huge![deleted]GO to las vegas. They still smoke indoors.\n\nI hate it, but to be honest? I'd take it in a heartbeat to rewind.\n\nlolol. And no I'm not a technophobe. The opposite actually. But society has been so so fucked by unchecked capitalism and the internet together.I was on Facebook and there was a video of a guy being arrested for smoking on a plane. There was an unbelievable amount of comments defending him and reminiscing about the good old days when everyone smoked indoors and insistence it is no big deal. Fucking boomers.Would be awesome if we banned indoor public smartphones as wellIt\u2019s not better. I loved smoking indoors at work and in pubsI'm a non smoker but never really noticed much difference. Kinda miss the smell of smoke wafting from the smoking section, tbh.Smoking in bars and clubs and wherever the fuck I wanted are my fondest memories of youth.I miss it...I remember eating breakfast with the work crew enjoying some coffee, tacos, and cigarettesI am definitely in the minority, but smoking bans are fucking stupid. Smoking is legal and any business owner should have the right to allow it in their establishment. If you don\u2019t want to go there, don\u2019t. A neighboring town had 33 Non-smoking establishments that served alcohol. They passed a ban and afterward, they had zero that allowed smoking. They tried the same thing in my town and the city council listened to the bars owners and the council shot it down. Eventually that state passed the ban and won the argument. I have news for you, non-smokers die everyday too. I was a non-smoker for twenty-five years and the last night before the ban, I started smoking cuz fuck the government and Rob Reiner. To all you people who bitch about the smell find a new bar or go suck Kyle\u2019s mom\u2019s tits. \ud83d\udeac \ud83d\udd95I preferred smoky bars. I'm ok with no smoking in restaurants and grocery stores. It goes too far with things like \"tobacco free property\".People stopped smoking inside and that's when the chuds came at meMinnesota banned smoking indoors, but here I sit at Jackpot in the smoking break room, puffing on my vape.Cigs inside kind of slaps though ngl. Like the random bars that allow it. Just something different about ripping a lung dart without having to get up out of your seatI remember when they banned it at restaurants where I live. We had a discussion about it in one of my classes and a classmate was really upset because her father believed it was going to put his Bar out of business.\n\nI still don\u2019t understand how he (our hood kid) thought that would happen if every bar was subject to the same changes.i would trade the internet back for indoor smoking in a heartbeat.Chronic asthmatic here, the old enough to remember when some restaurants had a smoking area or just allowed it wherever. Thank fuck that shit is over.Do y\u2019all remember smoking on *airplanes?*  Ugh. Now THAT, my friends, that was brutal.   Desperately trying to breathe through your shirt as a little kid, while every adult around you smoked it up on a metal tube in the sky. Not for an oppressed minority group like smokers themselves.  In today's social climate self inflicted choices still allow for someone to call oppression, animosity, and discrimination. Why is it okay to ban smokers,but it is socially wrong to ban people who don't keep good personal hygiene? Both affect others,both are bad habits and bad for them. Both \"can\" affect mental and physical health of those around them.     Just playing devil's advocate is allI'm a smoker and we definitely talk about it. On a cold day, someone outside the bar might mention it and I'll sit there shivering admitting to them that I definitely prefer how it is now compared to how it was when we could smoke inside. I'd smoke a whole pack in 5 hours back then.  \nIt was disgusting. Everything smelt like an ashtray. Your boss could smell if you'd been out drinking the night before. Even if you only went out on weekends people's closets would smell like cigarettes.  \nThe fact that we ever allowed such a thing as a society is honestly baffling. We just let people make every space uncomfortable and stinky. I guess it's a reflection on humanity? I'm possibly reaching...  \nThe smoking ban has almost certainly extended my life by a couple decades. I remember being upset when it happened, but now I'd literally take to the streets in protest if the ban was ever lifted.Yah i smoke so thats a perspective thing. While i mostly agree with non-indoor smoking in most places people are kinda nuts about the smoking topic since the SCARE PSA ads started showing up in the 90's. Everyone who is smoking is not gonna end up like those ads, and someone smoking nearby is almost definitely not going to make u get cancer. (Remember the THIS IS YOUR BRAIN.. [https://youtu.be/LQsQbuNWmnE](https://youtu.be/LQsQbuNWmnE) propaganda) We are people who like a recreation not unlike weed and certainly less outwardly destructive than alcohol. An outdoor smoking section at a bar is now a rarity here in Seattle- its going a bit far.It\u2019s so much better. You can\u2019t smoke on patios here either and that\u2019s great too.As someone who is allergic to tobacco, that day way life changing.Most places that allowed smoking in restaurants and bars used to require pretty big smoke filtering equipment. There was a whole industry around it. The equipment was so good at what it did, that the smoking section of many  places (especially large chain restaurants) had the cleanest air inside. Much of that industry dissolved in the wake of smoking bans. \n\nI wonder how much safer 2020 would have been for all of us, if we still had those big, high volume air filters in common use.\"Nobody ever talks about the joys of indoor plumbing\"\n\nThis is a stupid post and you should delete it.I travel a lot internationally and it's still allowed in a lot of places. If not inside, on decks and patios of restaurants. I get irrationally angry when people smoke near me now. Best law ever passed in my opinion.It\u2019s terrible when you can smell a person who still smokes in their car and home. I\u2019ll be at the grocery store and one of those people walk by and the just reek of cigarette smoke. \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2eSpeak for yourself. I'm not even a smoker but I would have loved to live in an age where people just lit up whenever and wherever. More freedom > less freedom, even if it comes at the cost of your health.IMHO it is because nothing is bad about stopping smoking indoors. And so many things are bad since internet has come. Nobody speaks about what's goodFunnily enough, when our state decided to create odd rules during covid (not lockdowns or masks, but arbitrary curfews and bullshit)  long standing rules broke down a bit.  On more than one occasion I walked into the local gas station and the old ladies behind the counter were smoking.\n\nAt the local tractor supply, there was a trans woman smoking while unloading pallets.\n\nI fully support that level of freedom.  A \"fuck it\" mentality can be quite fun.They should of left it up to the owners of the establishment to due as they feel necessary. You can still smoke in pretty much all casinos and pretty sure congress members can smoke in the chambers in Washington dcI feel old when I say I remember people smoking indoors at bars \nIt is so good that we don\u2019t have to deal with second hand smoke. And you can tell the only down voters are smokersOne of the greatest injustices of the 21st century.\n\nWhy the fuck should a bar owner not allow smoking in his property if he wants to?   Anybody who doesn't like it was absolutely free to not walk in.   Whiny bastards wanted to poison themselves with booze but objected to being around another type of poison so they got the government to stick their nose in and take away yet another right.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who was just about done quitting when smoking was banned in bars in my area - I benefited tremendously from the ban but it still doesn't justify the infringement of property rights.Yes, how awful, people used to sit around and smoke and talk to each other. Now the world is nice and clean with people all sitting 3m apart and only talking via text message.Internet is global. There are still countries allowing indoor smoking. Can\u2019t really compareI miss the smoky rooms and places where annoying families didn\u2019t come. Smoking made good restaurants Karen proof. They kept fruity drink people out of good bars. \n\nOverall, banning indoor smoking was a loss for society and public health. Go somewhere else.In the UK, smoking inside pubs masked the odours of piss and sweat. Now we just have piss and sweat.I travel for work with someone who smokes. They occasionally get a smoking room. There have been numerous occasions where their smoke gets into my non smoking room through their bathroom vent. It is absolutely disgusting, so I highly appreciate non smoking public areas. Especially because I\u2019m from Vegas and remember people smoking in the casinos.I sometimes, occasionally, miss eating breakfast at a diner while having a cigarette. Only sometimes.I have to fully agree. The ban on smoking in public places made things 100% betterJust wait, Florida will bring it back because smoking is \u201cbiblical\u201d or some b.s.Idk ima smoker and smoking indoors seems nice but I understand that if you don\u2019t smoke then ya life got a lot better indoorsLol restaurant smoking sections. See the smoke there magically stays there. RightBecause when you bring it up, you also bring up how draconian it to make smokers stand outside in the blazing summer sun or freezing cold. How prohibition sucks. How overbearing the related legislation is, and all of this because a minority subset of the population couldn't get over the smell.I will never miss being nauseated by the smell of my own hair after going out for the evening\u2026.   It got to the point where I would shower when I got home no matter how late because if I had anything to drink and wasn\u2019t feeling good in the morning, my hair smelling like smoke made it so much worse.Must\u2019ve stank really bad. I don\u2019t care if someone else smokes but the nasty smell it leaves in everything and your clothes too is just nopeIt's amazingly normal, and the way it should always have been.I bring this up a lot lately when I describe what it is like with an EV. I don\u2019t inhale fumes and my garage smells like gardening supplies instead of oil. I have become more sensitive to the smell of gasoline and exhaust fumes.I think about how great that is every time I am near a smokerI look forward to the time when walking on a city sidewalk you don't have to breathe in the exhaust from all the running vehicles.I\u2019m a broker and they still smoke inside my office like it\u2019s Wall Street in 1995. I hate it.So glad for the ban. Not looking forward to international travel to places that still allow it.You know I think people are nicer since tobacco use dropped. Poeple used to be very impatient and snappy.Grew up in Germany in the 90s where some family members owned a pub and good grief, I don't know how I survived all that smoke \ud83d\ude02 even when I was young and didn't know any better, the smell would annoy me.\n\nNow I can't imagine spending a weekend somewhere filled with smoke, yuck.\n\nI was in Japan a few years ago and seriously shocked by the indoor smoking in some cafes. It smelled so bad that I had to abandon my coffee and leave one cafe and at another I was at in the \"non smoking section\" separated by a wall and it still stunk. My only bad eating experience in Japan, everything else was amazing.I remember when this first got implemented and watched everyone throw complete meltdown temper tantrums because god forbid they don't impose their stench on everyone else.One of the best things about banning indoor smoking is it dissuades people from smoking or prompts them to quit. Its not that attractive standing outside an office building to smoke in the freezing rain. Where I live smokers have to stay at least 20 feet away from the entrances.A lot of people talk about it. There are many studies that analyze it and show how it improved public health.It is glorious and my spouse, sister, and BIL were just talking a couple weeks ago about how great it is! This coming from a former smoker. \n\nWhen I was pregnant with my first, I lived in NC and smoking indoors had become illegal in the previous year or two so I didn't have to worry about it there. I flew to IN, where it was still legal, for a friend's grad party in a bar. I came home with the worst sinus infection I'd ever had. I never appreciated no smoking more and am 11+ years smoke-free!Is life better though ? I find a lot of things worse nowadaysIt\u2019s wild to think about the fact that 30 years ago you\u2019d have ash raining on your personal pan pizza you got for free from book it.I don\u2019t smoke but I really want to smoke indoors now that I know I can\u2019tMy dad was a big activist on this topic in my (then) little hometown in Northern California back in the early 1990s. He went to the city council meetings and petitioned. Finally a smoking ban for restaurants and bars was passed. Then I left home and lived in other states/cities where there wasn\u2019t a ban and it\u2019s a night and day difference. Smoking sucks and smokers suck.Smells better, sure, but notice the anxiety disorders are thru the roof?I shake my head when I see the no smoking sign on airplanes. Most useless warningI always thought I hated bowling. Turns out I just hated bowling alleys because the smoke would give me a migraine.Oh my god yes. I am so allergic and have asthma. Smoking in restaurants was always an issue for me.   \n\n\nCan ya\u2019ll please like my comment? I need comment karma so I can post in one of my groups.  Thank you \u2764\ufe0fWe do.\n\nGoing to a smokers pub for one pint and having a ripper hang over the next day.\n\nGo to a restaurant and asking for no smoking and the table either side of you were smoking.\n\nWhen I was a kid ppl could smoke on buses, trains, cinema and department stores.\n\nI was smoking before I was born. When I met mum after school I craved the smell of the strong cigarettes and didn't realise I was addicted.That\u2019s because it didn\u2019t make life different. It just made bars less gross.I've been pushing for a total ban on smoking. Don't care if you chew or use edibles, but fuck off with that cloud of stink.lung cancer deaths peaked at 160k in 2005. obesity kills double that amount now and obesity is increasing. Lung cancer still kills 130k a year. I would tolerate public smoking if the fatties went awayBecause my stress levels have never been higher indoors since then and if you mention it I will have a panic attack so hard I'll vom my lungs into your lap.Nah i think some places should bring indoor smoking back. \nI wanna be able to goto a bar and smoke. And if people dont want to have smoke in their face they can just go somewhere else.Can we ban smoking in general? Please?\n\n\nMost everyday smokers I pass on the street are inconsiderate fucks, they never step away from other people, every street in my city is littered with butts, my fucked up lungs can't take breathing this vomit-inducing odour.\n\n\nI wish I lived in a world without tobaccoRight? Doesn't make any sense considering they are basically on the same level. For instance, one changed the entire world while the other didn't matter at all.As a bartender, fuck your sweat, I'd rather smell cigarette smoke\n\nAlso I smoke, but I know non smoking bartenders agreeYou mean how terrible life became? it was the first domino in the decline of humanityBack in 2015 I was going on a college trip to Romania and we were told they still allow indoor smoking there which was pretty cool (not a big smoker but out at the bars I might buy a pack). Turns out the law recently changed there and they also didn\u2019t allow smoking indoors lol.I am living somewhere where it isn\u2019t and it always surprises me and makes me very happy it\u2019s banned at home.Not that many people who lived when It was legal can appreciate this...Honestly, considering how much we've slid backwards in some areas over the last few years (in some areas) I'm really surprised we haven't seen some kind of fucked up push for smoking to be more socially acceptable and less restricted.  \n\nHope I don't jinx it.I'm part of a touring band and we make stops in Oklahoma occasionally, where they still allow smoking in bars. We have to air out all our merch the day after any OK gig cause of all the smoke.I'm shocked nobody else has memories of this. I'm 31 and grew up in Illinois and while it wasn't super frequent I have a few early memories of it when going with my neighborhood friend out to eat (whose mom was a smoker). I wasn't old enough to remember having any thoughts other than oh these restaurants kinda smell worse than other ones I've been to.Yeah it\u2019s fantastic, now the people smoke outside and I have to close the window.If I went to a bar to see a band inhad to shower and put my clothes in the wash before going to bed. I don't smoke but the odor would fill the house just from being on my clothes, skin and hair. Thank you public policy sea change!Actually that was the talk I had with a friend\u2019s parents today \n\nThey said they were used to getting home with holes in their clothing caused by people accidentally hitting their cigars in them \n\nEvery bar was completely covered in dust and smoke and stuff like that \n\nReally made me grateful for not experiencing itThat\u2019s because the mobile imaginationland\u2019s many people have been living in is so much worse than smelling burnt carbon.and we need to keep it that way, no bubblegum ass vape smells while I'm eating please.I literaly bring this up all the time. I have two friends that are long time smokers and I give em shit every chance I get to quitI'm the guy that always reminds everyone that brown and orange aesthetic in the 60's and 70's had a reason.As a person who wasnt around then, this seems kinda goofy to meDo people with iPhones really think they are that ground breaking that they are mentioned on the same level as the internet? Are they that clueless that smartphones is a category and iPhone is just a product.Well now you can no longer light a cigarette to make your food come fasterI'm just glad we can step outside and take a breathe of fresh chemicalsI wish more places would put smoke free zones around the  entrances and exits of their establishment\n\nIt winds me up that I have to walk my kids and I through plumes of second hand smoke just to get in or out of somewhere.I am glad it is better or you. for me is not. whatever, I gave up going out. enjoy your smoke free environment!Because the internet opened doors to ideas that weren't fathomable good and bad. While banning smoking was pretty much to cater to people who couldn't handle smoke...Better? What do you mean better? I can't smoke indoors anymore! It's horrible!I Think What Would Help Most , Is Banning Unverified Electromagnetic Bodies In Safe Spaces That Don\u2019t Bring Good Vibes To Our Psyche . . . Or When Groups Of People Are Lead To Some Dramatic States Of Thinking . . .Second hand smoke, inhaled indoors, caused a disease that laid dormant until resurfacing as \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. if they hadn\u2019t banned it, there would have been a lot more waves of the virus but luckily one of the people making the money off the \u201cdeadly scam\u201c had a change of heart and turned to whistleblowing.Uh-huh, great.\n\nI knew at least 3 places where you had smoking and no-smoking rooms, vents all over the place, air conditioning, regularly changed ashtrays, and it kinda worked. I had no trouble visiting those places in a non-smoking areas (For the context, I've started smoking several years after the ban), but I strongly disagree with the solution the law provided, by completely banning indoor smoking. If your place can afford splitting the rooms, adequate air cleaning and some other measures, I don't see any reason to restrict those from indoor smoking. There are still some places known to me, but they either have to use weird law loopholes, or they just DGAF due to corruption.They're trying to save people from themselves. But life isn't perfect, and neither are we. It's those imperfect moments that make us human. Stripping away personal choice, one smoke-filled room at a time, steals the very essence of what it means to live. It's the unscripted, the flawed, and the shared experiences that create the most enduring memories. Let's not let the world become a sterile imitation of what it should be.Luckily casino workers and guests are immune to 2nd hand cigarette effects. /sSshhh don\u2019t give Republicans any more ideas for progress to overturn.Out of sight out of mind. Republicans hoping the same works for trans people.Indoor smoking has not been banned everywhere. It's still legal in Florida and Texas. Where I live in Miami, smoking is technically banned on all hospital campuses, but the ***third world security guards*** at Kendall Regional Hospital and Jackson Memorial Hospital refuse to enforce the smoking ban.  I hope that these spineless, lazy, security guards develop a fatal illness from secondhand smoke.My life isn't better because of that. In Kentucky there are some spots still. I love a smoke with a meal and/or drinkNah, I'm still pretty against it. I'm not a fan of cigarettes, but I vape and would really enjoy getting to do that while going out to eat. When I find places that allow smoking indoors it makes me really happyBut all the parks and neighborhoods allow the cars to smoke all they want. You know what rolling coal is? . \n\nSo our outdoors is now the smoking area.Because it isn't and smoking indoors was so nice and fuck everyone who wanted to stop it.Idaho bars beg to differ!\n\nWell some of them. I've been to a few bars in idaho but most allowed smoking. Usually lots of reaaaaally old people.Sometimes I go in diners and bars where part of it smells like smoke, and it makes me nostalgic. \ud83e\udd72\n\nMy mom used to say, \"Never date a guy who puts his cigs out in his food,\" and now I have to wait to find out. It kills me. (Also, never hand someone a pack without packing it, or a cigar without preparing it, don't throw cellophane on the floor, or the table, decant your cigarettes into a case and never leave lipstick on cigarettes or cups. Always carry a lighter. Using holders saves your fingers. Put out your cigarettes when the food arrives. Offer cigarettes and cigars with coffee. Smoke follows beauty. Always blow smoke up in a line. One ashtray for two people.) It's a whole education in itself.\n\nWhen my mom was sick and I was single digits, she'd go for treatment for about six months, twice a week, chemo or radiation, and I'd hang out downstairs in the hospital lobby by the pharmacy, pay phones, vending machines, explore the stairs and the basement, feed squirrels for four hours or so. There was a group of about eight men that had no larnyxes, some had just holes and some had electronic voice boxes, playing cards and drinking coffee by the many vending machines.\n\nThey co opted me and would hang out with me, tell me all their stories. I thought it was great. Then they had to smoke outside, so they all moved outside and showed me how they smoke through the holes in their throats and tell me war tales. Fun times. My dad was high up and my mom, an opera singer, had what they thought was throat cancer, but all that went over my head and I just liked them. I won them over.Same in Ireland.Moved from CA to Michigan 13 years ago and it was still allowed. Felt very weird/backwards. It's been many years since they finally banned it but the bowling alleys still reek.I\u2019m mid 20\u2019s and I remember the smoking sections in restaurants, I was always in them. Good ol south east baby.Yeah, I was gonna say...I'm 27 and have literally never seen anyone smoking indoors in a public place.  Watching Mad Men, it just seems so weird to me, not just that everyone smokes so much, but where they choose to do it.  All I can think about that every single inch of every room probably *reeks* of tobacco, and every wall is gonna get super yellowed tooAbout a year ago I stopped to pee at a gas station/bar in Wyoming and had to walk through the bar to get to the bathroom. Between the thick haze of cigarette smoke, Conway Twitty playing on a sticky looking juke box and the dark brown fake wood paneling on the walls, I felt like I was transported back in time to the 80\u2019s. It was depressing AF, lmao. Best part was, even though I was wearing a flannel and hopped out of a 12yr old SUV, the way the bar\u2019s patrons stopped and looked at me, I might as well have been a Drag Queen getting out of a Tesla.\n\nKids into the whole vaporwave/outrun aesthetic need to visit that shithole so they know what the 80\u2019s *really* looked and sounded like everywhere that wasn\u2019t LA or Miami.Seriously. I grew up in CA in the 80s and me and my friends talk about this from time to time. Like going to Vegas, I'm like what's this familiar smell?? Oooh right, cigarettes.My wife is 10 years younger. When I tell her that people smoked in busses, trains, Caf\u00e9s, everywhere, she replies \"Naaah, that would have smelled horribly, wouldn't it\".\n\nYes my love, it did. Oh, it did.I used to remember having to leave my coat in the car so it wouldn't smell after going out, even if it was like 5 degrees out. Then coming home and having to shower because you just reeked. People don't know how good it is now.This is accurate.  I remember the smoking \"sections\" that were in every restaurant and how absurd they were,  even as a kid it made zero sense.  But my children,  will never have seen it.  \n\nI also remember a time before home computers and widespread internet access.  At one point your best option was the library for it.  How wild is that now.Im 29. I never experienced people smoking indoors.I don't smoke and never have.  I recall when I was in my 20s, going out at the bars and waking up with a sore throat and a hangover \n\nThose poor bartenders in that smoke every night. \n\nRemember smoking in restaurants? Can't smoke here, but 2 seats down that way it's totally cool broSame in NYC. I remember going to the bars and clubs in my 20s and coming out smelling like an ashtray. And that was about 20 years agoYeah I think it was the early 90s smoking indoors was banned in California.\n\nI still remember this d-bag getting beat up at McDonald's for it. Multiple people told him to smoke outside, he got pissed & purposely blew smoke into someone's baby stroller & got knocked out for it.Oh I just explained to my teenage kids what life used to be like with smoking when I was a kid, and also what it was like for my parents (smoking during tests in college!  smoking at the movie theater!).  \n\nThey rolled their eyes and ignored me.  \n\nPeople like complaining about now.  People think complaining about the past is boring I walked both ways uphill in the snow kind of talk.I'm 28 and I barely recall smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants when I was a little kid. My mom said it didn't matter because the whole place smelled like smoke anyway.Mid 30s here, and smoking ban came in for my second year at university. This comes up a lot when reminiscing with friends, because the difference from one night to the next was so massive!\n\nThe emergence of the smells that had been hiding behind the smoke made us all wonder for a while if the ban was worth it (it was).This. I'm 35, and I *barely* remember smoking sections in restaraunts.I did here (Georgia) but mainly in bars and clubs. But even that's banned now thankfully.Most of California also stopped using that goddamn laundry detergent that had the fake flower stink to cover up the cigarette smoke stink.  That stuff smells terrible and takes forever to wash out of the clothes.There's still bars by me that do smoking indoorsYeah, there is no reference point. Like 15 years ago I stayed in a hotel that allowed smoking and it took me a few days to realize why I felt so shit.And, at least in the case of one bar local to me, the stench of dead rats under the floor boards.I used to smoke when I was younger, and if we couldn't afford smokes, we could go to a cheap club with no cover charge and just passive smoke for a few hoursCasinos still have that cigarettes' smellOMG, this. \n\nThe ban happened some time ago here (Ireland) but this was the immediate reaction. In the dirtier pubs you\u2019d get a stench of stale beer (and /or smell from the toilets). In the nicer places, just the smell of BO.The smoke covered up farts too lolDon\u2019t forget the smell of urineThere was a story about a dead body being found inside a wall in a bar after the smoke stopped covering the stench.. Stay classy WinnipegAlso made it very difficult to light up a joint without anyone being able to figure out who did it...A beer and an ashtray pleaseI thought you intentionally said loughing, which would be a blend between laughing and coughing.Ah, buses in the Balkans:\n\n\"Ugh, which jackass is smoking right now?\"\n\nLooks around, sees it's the bus driverI\u2019m pretty sure the Balkans banned *not* smoking inside.to be fair we really should though. Vaccination rates for things like measles are falling and the public needs a reminder on how horrible these preventable diseases are* Or polio\n\n* Or unleaded gasoline\n\n* Or even having to rewind a movie for minutes... minutes!!I honestly talk with my siblings how good they had it getting the chicken pox vaccine. Less than ten years apart and they avoided one of the worst infections of my life.As a trombone player, so did I.1000%, I posted elsewhere, but I normally will wear jeans 3 or 4 times before washing them, but they always fucking reeked after playing a show. So it was either stink for 2 days or do laundry an extra day that week.Bartenders, waitresses, and musicians were the original people that got the indoor smoking ban put into law. I truly do not miss the stank of smoke while watching a band play.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/31/us/california-s-ban-to-clear-smoke-inside-most-bars.htmlIt took many years for my favorite bass to stop smelling like smoke from gigging in smokey bars.I'm too young to have seen smoking on planes, but I still remember playing with the ashtrays from all the planes that were in service in that time. Assholes would put gum in them, I don't know why that specifically is such a vivid memory.People would buy smoke reeking clothing from malls[deleted]I thought the cigarette machines with those twisty handles were wicked cool back in the day tho. Haven\u2019t seen one of those in a hot minuteRemember the non smoking sections? Restaurants put a little gate or some tables between the two sections. It did nothing.I actually remember being a kid and people smoking at the doctor's office. The seats had large ashtrays attached. Crazy to think about.\n\nSo much better now.The smoking and non-smoking sections being seperated by a half wall with a foot of plexiglass on top while the smoke haze drifts across the entire family restaurant was a sight to behold.But how!? The smokers were perfectly hermetically sealed in their own section, separated from you by... the salad bar and open space above and around itYou could smoke on planes?! This is such a bonkers concept to me. In my head, smoking on a plane might cause other issues besides bothering others. Like what if there\u2019s a fire? Or what if the smoke damages something on board an active flight? \n\nWowzas. I had no idea there was ever a time you could smoke on planes.I hope to God I'm not the only person who still remembers the smoking section on *airplanes*. It was half of the plane. Flights used to be longer, too. Bad.Before the full non-smoking rules, US domestic flights under 2 hours didn't allow smoking. I had relatives who worked in rebuilding aircraft parts. They knew which planes allowed smoking from the disgusting goo they had to scrape off from ventilation parts.>I remember meals would be ruined at a restaurant when the table next to you would light up a cigarette.\n\n[\"excuse me I ordered a Zima, not emphysema\"](https://youtu.be/GlgvzHoueBg)> Cloths would reek of smoke after leaving a bowling alley\n\nHonestly they still kind of do. It\u2019s a lot less now but most bowling alleys I\u2019ve been to that were built pre-2005 still have that lingering smell even years after indoor smoking bans.I was a teenager/smoker at the time, and I even appreciated the change. To be sure it was cool going to punk shows and Denny\u2019s or playing just chain smoking (cool to a teenager), but quality of life and just being able to enjoy a space was huge. PLUS, this unintended benefit emerged for smokers - now, any time of year no matter the weather, you could go outside and there was a little ecosystem of interesting people grabbing a quick smoke. Definitely almost a social subculture, making new friends was so easy, and it was always a good time!\n\nThat\u2019s the only thing I missed when I quit smoking, was the band of random derelicts you\u2019d be forced to interact with a few times a night when you were out.As an asthmatic, there are places I can go now that I never could before.As an asthmatic, it was a godsend.  I was in my 20s when it passed here, and I spent a lot of time in the bowling alley where my best friend worked.  My ability to breathe improved *so* much.  \n\nI actually hadn't thought about it, but I think my biannual trips to the hospital for my asthma stopped around then too.The \"I refuse not to smoke in public. If you don't like cigarettes, don't leave your home.\" people were the same ones who eventually evolved into the \"I refuse to wear a mask or get vaccinated. If you're afraid of Covid, don't leave your house.\" people.Nothing bothers me more than cigarette smoke. We recently had a homeless guy was living in the hallways of the apartment and smoking, and it was *fucking brutal*. I'm so glad to be alive in a time when smoking is not allowed indoors. I would be constantly coughing and gagging otherwise.Well I don't have asthma specifically, but my lungs tend to be pretty sensitive and weird due to the remnants of a birth defect. Like, I find myself clearing my throat a lot cause mucus and shit builds in there very easily due to the deformity. And yeah, smoke is fucking horrid, it makes me feel like I need to cough up a lung to clear myself out, irritating and makes that annoying shit build up faster.\n\nLike imagine if someone walked around with a pesticide sprayer, going through a crowd and misting people's faces. But if it's a cigarette you're fine. Fucking wild[deleted]I had asthma as a kid because of second hand smoke, started going away shortly after they made it illegal to smoke in the car with your kids insideThis isn't very different to covid and masking tbh but somehow as a society we don't get it.I'm allergic to nicotine, and I like not breaking out with hives just from going inside.I actually really like the smell of cigarettes. Ive never smoked, and i didn\u2019t even grow up in a home where people smoked\u2026 but it gives me a nostalgia hit because when i was growing up it was still more common. I remember going to Disneyland and they would have these designated smoking areas that were packed full of people back in the day\u2026 and like it was pretty common to have a relative\u2019s or friend\u2019s parent\u2019s car smelling thick of smoke. So idk\u2026 just reminds me of good times and good people i guess.\n\nAnd idk i guess its super weird but man those older restaurants and stuff that barely got the smoke out, were dark and dingy and the waitresses nails were as long as her fingers, with a hoarse voice and all that\u2026 idk man\u2026 its a time that will never come back. Its like, unless you were there, you wouldn\u2019t get it. Its this weird comfort. A time before everything was wired and connected together. People were just these strangers you\u2019d meet in odd places like these\u2026 and life was interesting.As an ex-smoker (quit 20 years ago) cigarette smoke is the one smell I absolutely cannot stand. Someone smoking in an office doorway as I walk past? Disgusting. Standing next to someone on the train who has just had a cigarette? Worse. But the only thing worse than that is someone smoking a roll-up - even if it\u2019s outside on the street it makes me gag and I have to cross the road or something. \n\nI don\u2019t like vaping either, but it\u2019s tolerable to walk past. I can\u2019t wait until nobody smokes.I'm a smoker and I agree.\n\nIf someone is smoking ill stand away and if I'm smoking, I'll cross the roadi wish i could wait for the bus without having someone light up next to me. i move upwind butt then another smoker shows up and stands next to me. i'm half a block away by the time my bus comesI always loved a line I heard about those sections.\n\nHaving a smoking section in a restaurant is like having a peeing section in a swimming pool.Pretty interesting times now.\n\nI\u2019m Nebraska, I believe we banned it ca 2007ish. I was doing IT for an Applebees franchise around 2013. Walked into one in Missouri and was hit with a blanket of smoke. Had to think for a second. \u201cOh yeah. Wasn\u2019t long ago that Nebraska was similar\u201dMcDonald's had those aluminum ashtrays with their logo.I visited Vegas about 5 years ago, and ate at a place that was on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. The restaurant area was in the back of a small casino. Perhaps there was no smoking in the restaurant, but since they were smoking outside of there, it was still awful.Waiters and Waitresses used to ask \"smoking or non?\" when seating you.In 2019, I went to a casino in Idaho that had a smoking section. Unfortunately, that's where the good machines were.Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming, for anyone curious.I work at a Tribal casino. Shit is wild to work in. After a year of working there I\u2019m looking elsewhere due to my morning cough and wheeze I\u2019ve acquiredA smokers corner in an open restaurant is like a peeing corner in a swimming pool.Ohio is always in the top two or three smoking states per capita.  Not sure where the other schools were, but it makes sense that young people + Ohio = more than your average number of smokers.I remember when the smoking ban came into effect in Ireland that was a big concern at the time. I don't think anyone actually considered that it might make a lot more non smokers inclined to go to the pub. In the end it had little effect on the pub scene.Don\u2019t forget how the nonsmoking section was two feet from the smoking section, like the smoke would magically be stopped by an invisible forcefield between the two sections.That\u2019s a nasty sore throat too.Burns my eyes too.  Sometimes, to the point to where I cannot see or drive home until I flush my eyes with water and spend a half hour in fresh air.Cigarette smoke sticks around forever. I didn't realize until recently my clothes reeked of the smell after visiting my grandma, who smokes in her home.How dare you take away my freedom to spread cancer[deleted]Interesting, I dont know the history of when the indoor smoking bans took effect where, but I'm in my 30s and I have clear memories of most restaurants having smoking sections back when I was a kid. You could still smell cigarettes in the nonsmoking section. When I was 16, I started my first job at a local restaurant, and that is also the year I took up smoking because EVERYONE back of house was smoking on the job (while making food!). This only lasted about a year before the ban came into play, but that was in the 2000's, doesn't feel that long ago to me.That's interesting, I'm 37 and my state banned it in 2006.  Admittedly, I am an asthmatic, so I always noticed when I was near smokers, but I absolutely recall requesting nonsmoking section seating, and being seated right at the partition where you were in a booth and there was a 2 foot tall clear plastic \"separator\" above the booth height from the booth right next to you.  It was not a good system.  Maybe you were lucky and grew up in California, where they banned it in the 90s?Wow, Luby's. Been a minute since I thought about that flat square cod \"filet\" with the breadcrumb topping and the little glass dish of green jello cubes for dessert. Gourmet shit as a kid.I remember when it was banned and in a Millennial too. A bunch of us when to the diner after a school play and one of the other stage crew people had a prop cigarette tucked behind her ear for whatever reason and this older woman came over and started giving us hell for it. \"Lady, it's a prop. It's a rolled up piece of computer paper. Calm the hell down.\"\n\nWeird things you remember, you know?If my hotel finds evidence you smoke in the room, that\u2019s a $200 fee. Why would you ever even attempt that?? Then I have the dicks that can\u2019t walk 30 feet to the smoking area, and litter their butts all over my property. You can guarantee I\u2019m watching my camera footage, seeing exactly who did it, and hitting them with $5 per instance. Fuck these people that can\u2019t respect other\u2019s property or the fucking worldOh, God! Sitting in the backseat behind smokers! The worst!!One time it was so bad from my mom's smoke (it was cold and raining and she had a van with the back windows that barely popped open)  I had a panic/asthma attack and passed out in the car. She cracked a window but still smokes the rest of the way homeI grew up in a city and the only time we\u2019d be in car was in a taxi, which was rare. My parents always thought I was \u201ccar sick\u201d but I felt nauseous because the drivers smoked. Even just remembering it now makes me gag.Oh god I remember getting a lift from some people in Dubai. They wound the windows up (due to the extreme heat) and both lit up. \n\nIt was torture. I couldn\u2019t say anything as they were doing me a favour. Had I known they were going to smoke I would have got a taxi.I'll never forget after the first shelter in place mandate, the air was so clear, it was so quiet, no obnoxious ICE noise, no leaf blowers every hour. Just clean air, the wind in the trees and the birds.People talk about air pollution and smog and how car smells all the time. The difference is that we are forced to use ICE engines, while smoking is a \u201cpersonal choices\u201d that affects everyone around the smoker.Driving is considered a net positive for society. Its benefits outweigh the costs. Now, that may not actually be the case, but the argument can be made.\n\nFor smoking, there is no argument. It is only negative.Bro, not to mention the environmental costs to roads in general. Shit, even the tar used to seal cracks and maintain  the roads is some  awful shit.Smoking suppresses appetite so they actually might be.that, and instead of smoking, people are drinking themselves stupid. shit like beer is notorious for unhealthy weight gain. and trading lung cancer for liver cirrhosis doesn't seem like a good deal...Yep. The smoking section has just moved outside. It's not usable for people sensitive to smoke.As someone who occasionally smokes, in the rare instances I want to burn one after eating while waiting for the rest of my party to finish up I always leave the outdoor area a significant distance to smoke because why the fuck wouldn't you. Like, it's not hard to at least *try* and be courteous, damn. Even when I chain-smoked like a mofo I'd still get annoyed when people smoked at the table next to me while eating.It is in some places, there's no smoking anywhere food or alcohol is served here, people have to leave the patio area to smokeSmoking isn't allowed in outside patios where I live.[deleted]You do realize businesses can kick out legit service animals if they're not behaving right?They banned indoor smoking in about 2007 (in Victoria anyway). In the 90s and early 2000s everyone smoked in nightclubs and pubs, restaurants had smoking and non-smoking sections. It was weird initially when smoking was banned because you realised it covered up all the bad smells - stale beer, vomit, farts, body odour etc. My hair and clothes would reek of smoke after a night out. I don't miss being burnt or having my clothes singed by a careless person walking past with a lit ciggie or even worse, on the dance floor with arms flailing around.\nSo it makes sense you never would've experienced it. I still remember when I was little, people smoked in the cinema (a haze of smoke rose up above the crowd), in shopping centres, some workplaces had a little smoker's section behind a partition in the staff break room. Seems inconceivable now.Some trendy bars have smoke/fog machines so you can have the aesthetic without the cigarettesSame. Non smokers will never realize how strong the social aspect is. It's the best part.\n\nI don't go outside as much as I used to either which is sad. I just have no reason to go stand outside for 10-15 minutes anymore. I miss it.Tax revenue and tobacco master settlement payments.  Ban smoking and those don't get funded.  That's why.Love it.Can you believe how cgi has changed special effects in movies.\n\n\nEspecially when you compare it to women earning the right to voteI had a similar situation. I was diagnosed with asthma and it was a complete \u201cmystery \u201c as to why. Then at a family gathering with all chain smokers indoors I had a serious asthma attack.10000000% true.[deleted]As someone with breathing problems I 100% noticed a diffrence.I never noticed. It was just normal and expected. Guess we were just used to it.The majority of people don't thoughSmoking should be banned for everyone who is currently under the age of 18. Let all the smokers die and keep the young from ever picking up the habit.I personally can\u2019t stand packaged/processed food. It leads to obesity and poor nutrition. However, I don\u2019t think we should ban it from grocery stores. If you want to eat Cheetos, drink Mountain Dew and get diabetes that\u2019s on you. Your body your choice. Also, TikTok, Instagram and all other social media is bad for your social skills. Should we ban that too? Breathing second hand smoke inside a public establishment used to be a choice. It was never forced upon anyone. The ban is government control. They will eventually control everything and then you can sit in a pod living in the matrix while ChatGPT mind screws your living corpse.You started smoking to own the government?  So brave.A beer and a dart go together like a piss and a fart.I'm sorry, but calling smokers an \"oppressed minority group\" is a little much.I don't know where the heck you're from that this could be true but i have been to literally hundreds of bars back when smoking was allowed and I have never once experienced a bar where the air was clean and where people did not leave absolutely reeking of smoke.I am always surprised when I see people still smoking in their car. Especially a newer one. Like, you're just not trying to squeeze any value out of this depreciating asset.Winter is the worst - people smoke in their cars with the windows mostly up because it is cold, plus no one ever washes their smelly gross winter coats. So they have years of smoke embedded in them and are filthy. So nasty.\n> they should of left  \n    \nDid you mean to say \"should have\"?  \nExplanation: You probably meant to say could've/should've/would've which sounds like 'of' but is actually short for 'have'.  \nTotal mistakes found: 4584  \n^^I'm ^^a ^^bot ^^that ^^corrects ^^grammar/spelling ^^mistakes.\n^^PM ^^me ^^if ^^I'm ^^wrong ^^or ^^if ^^you ^^have ^^any ^^suggestions.   \n^^[Github](https://github.com/chiefpat450119)It's a health risk which affects those around you. You can choose to poison yourself, but it should be illegal to poison others.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/secondhand-smoke/health.htmlIt's 'should have', never 'should of'.\n\nRejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!100% this.  Selfish whiners wanted to get shitfaced without smelling smoke, so they got the government involved.   Just stay the fuck outside if you don't want to be in a smoky bar.  Problem?I remember saying \"no one goes to a bar to get healthy.\"Shit take. The two are clearly not equivalent - when you choose to drink you have picked a poison for yourself and inflict it on yourself. When you choose to smoke indoors you have picked a poison for yourself but inflict it on yourself and others. Saying being ok with one kind of poison should mean being ok with others inflicting all kinds of poison on you is great until you realize it means you're fine with being forcefully given krokodil because you're ok with cigarettes / booze. You're calling the people who are ok with inflicting their chosen poisons on themselves but not others \"selfish\". Ironic.[deleted]I mean. Your point about others consuming alcohol is pointless, because others consuming alcohol doesn't give me passive effects of consuming alcohol. Smoking does. \n\nOn the other hand, a sign on the front door of an establishment saying \"smoking allowed\" should notify people that they could be exposed to smoke. \n\nInteresting point.This is one of the craziest comments I have seen. Cops killing unarmed civilians,  no knock raids, and book bans, but smoking bans is the greatest injustice.That has nothing to do with banning smoking.I miss it quite a bit. Just hours of sitting at Waffle House chain smoking and drinking coffee. Good times. I mean, smoking bans are a net good, and I mostly agree with them, but that was nice.Maybe actually treating the underlying cause instead of using smoking as a bandaid might be in order here...Someone being fat doesn't personally alter my life in any way, 20 people in a crowded room puffing a butt does, the comparison is asinine.You can exist in places without smoke in the air. Many nonsmokers can't exist in places with smoke in the air. You can take a few minutes outside and go back to your seat if it's that important to you.So you want to ban yet another thing that adults  do in the privacy of their own homes?Lots of people have memories of it. They're in this thread. Taking about them.Why are you trying to get your food off? Also, how does lighting a cigarette speed it up?\"couldn't handle smoke\" yes I'd rather not have to handle lung cancerIt was too stop people from being exposed to the health risks of second hand smoke you twitWhat about the people who don't want to deal with indoor smoke? Why are smokers rights more important than theirs?Yeah, you can keep your nasty-smelling cancer clouds. I'll keep mine and my family's health in public spaces.This is overly dramatic considering that there are many alternative ways to get nicotine into yourself. There's chewing gum, patches, and even snuff (including oral snuff).I've been in a casino once, it was for a friend's bachelorette party. (Somewhat related, I was pregnant.) It was so smokey in there, it was awful and being pregnant I was even more repulsed by it. Terrible. It was like being back in high school at shady bowling alley local rock band's concerts.Your life might not be better, but it's definitely shorter.No? A lot of parks are smoke free zones.. and people always smoked in cars and neighborhoods. Generally you aren't in a restaurant and on the street at the same timeYou know, you can live a disgusting lifestyle and not be an asshole at the same timeIts funny cuz im sure your quality of life absolutely  sucks.Go away boomerGross afNot only how nice it is. But when the smoking ban came in we realised that pubs and niteclubs smelt like arse.\n\nIt launched a rejuvenation of pubs in ireland. Made them all have 1st smoking sections and then later lovely beer gardens.\n\nAlso food became far more important.\nAll connected or following from the smoking ban.\n\nId never go back. And i was a smoker until 201925 year old Irish person, have no memory of when smoking indoors was common at homeI was in Nashville in 2019 and it was allowed in some places.\n\nIt was fucking weirdSeveral co-workers raved about the good food at a local bowling alley. A co-worker and I went. The only person in there smoking was the cook. O.o\n\nIt was horrible food. I never did figure out if they were shitting us or if they really liked the food.I am a Michigander. The state (especially the rural areas) can be behind.honestly i miss that bowling alley stankAnd the non-smoking sections were still full of smoke, just less so than the smoking sections.Haha yeah. Like having the peeing and no-peeing sections in pools.Being 16 and puffing away in a restaurant was a rush. But I'm glad things have changed. 16 year old me also couldn't really comprehend what I was potentially getting into.I'm 37, and I was in high school when New York was talking about an indoor smoking ban. I can remember morning radio DJs saying that it would be the end of bars if it went through.Casinos are the only thing I can think of. I walked into Harrah's in Lake Charles once. Never again. Others may have smoking, but at least had okay ventilation to carry most of the smell out.\n\nEdit: I see they closed Harrah's in 2005. Horseshoe is in that location now.Cigarettes were regarded as natural and necessary as coffee.\n\nImagine banning coffee out of workplaces, hospitals, homes, cars, out of Resteraunt sand finally anywhere indoors.  It was really exactly that kind of legislative fight, and that kind of cultural and social shift in the end.  \n\nPeople can\u2019t get caffeine from someone else drinking coffee in the same room or building, and that\u2019s the important difference that is the only reason governments got away with forcing graduated bans on cigarettes out of workplaces.  Scientists could prove second-hand smoke caused lung cancer.   If only *smokers themselves* got lung cancer, cigarettes wouldn\u2019t have been exiled outdoors over time.  The legislative and social change was entirely based on workplace health and safety laws.\n\nAdults would smoke in cars with children, with asthmatic children, and think nothing of provoking asthma attacks, after all the kids had inhalers.  Smokers had an absolute right to their addiction before workplace safety laws changed the entire social zeitgeist.Really? Whereabouts you at? I\u2019ll be 30 in a week and from Canada and can distintily remember going to the restaurant my mom worked and there being smoking sections.I'm 27 and definitely have memories of diners like IHOP and Dennys still having smoking sections I smoked in as a teenagerI\u2019m 30 and remember restaurants having a smoking section when I was a kid. Now it\u2019s just bars and music venues that allow smoking inside. Most of my friends and coworkers smoke, so the smell doesn\u2019t really bother me.I'm also 27, I have some very early memories where smoking indoors was a thing. Probably just comes down to different areas banning it at different timesThey were.Im 31 and I remember my parents requesting the smoking section at restaurants.Head to Vegas.People still do. I know some bars in Vegas that allow it, same with TulsaOh yeah, people smoked in grocery stores, in line at the bank, just anywhere.I'm around the same age and while I don't remember people smoking indoors, I do remember my mom asking to be in the non-smoking section every time we went to a restaurant. And ashtrays on half the tables of my neighborhood diner. \n\nAlso...where did those combo trashcan/ashtrays go? I just realized they were so common, and now - are they totally gone?> Kids into the whole vaporwave/outrun aesthetic need to visit that shithole so they know what the 80\u2019s really looked and sounded like everywhere that wasn\u2019t LA or Miami\n\nSpend a few days in Kingman Az.  Grandmas still smoking in their cars with the windows up kind of 80\u2019s shit still alive and well.  It was just a gas stop for me going in and out of Vegas but holy shit.  What a tragic Time Machine of a shit town.Hey man, vaporwave enthusiasts enjoy the image portrayed in the media juxtaposed with the truth, not that they want to be there again.\n\n80s and 90s was all \"The future is here! Look at all the progress we will get! Recycling will save the world! Go into STEM and you'll be set!\". The carefree attitude extoled in the media at that time belied the true fact that it was all fake and the future has not turned out like they said. That all the consumerism of that time was destroying the earth despite being told we can fix it if we just tried harder.\n\nThe memory of this time is happy but the truth reminds us it was all fake so there's a sense of melancholy to the whole thing. That's why there's a dreamy or depressing aspect to it (which is why a lot of the songs are slowed down).\n\nDon't worry, I'm not trying to convince you to like vaporwave. Just giving you some info.Hey now, what did Conway Twitty ever do to you?i was a decades long smoker who finally quit.  \n\na month or two after quitting i walked through a crowd of smokers outside a theater.  it took no more than ten seconds to pass through the crowd but when i got home i realized my clothes reeked of smoke.  \n\ni can get on an empty elevator and know there had been a smoker on the elevator recently, not smoking on the elevator, but they had carried the stink onto the elevator.  \n\ni thoughtYeah Wyoming can be VERY unfriendly if you're not local.>the way the bar\u2019s patrons stopped and looked at me, I might as well have been a Drag Queen getting out of a Tesla.\n\nLOL just so descriptive LOLMy grandparents smoked a big part of my childhood and lot of my fruit my friends smoked in high school, I actually don't come across many smokers nowadays. Honestly when I do the smell is a little nostalgic.My mom, who has asthma, would choose restuarants based on whether the smoking section was in a different room at least.\n\nAt her favorite diner the two sections were on opposite ends, seperated by the kitchen and the lobby.Yep, we all suddenly became aware of everyone else\u2019s B.O. and bad breath \ud83d\ude37I've been to that bar.Well yeah, that's Charlie work.While nicotine is an addictive substance, I believe there was a psychological aspect to wanting to mask obscenities that neglect had on us and the environment we lived in. as I grew older, noticed a lot of people like to hide from responsibility and proper manners. even I do it, and getting better at not being neglectful.Tallahassee?Shiiiit, there was one bar that found a dead body when they banned smokingI feel like you\u2019re talking about The Seahorse in Halifax, Nova ScotiaMy mom and dad smoked inside and while driving when I was a kid.  I would of course go on to be a smoker and I was poor.  That combo allowed me to figure out I would be having nicotine withdrawal when I\u2019d go stay over at a friends house. It wasn\u2019t allergies or home sickness, I just needed a drag.My parents smoke but they used to be a lot poorer than they are now and this never worked for them. When they couldn't afford smokes they'd go looking in ash trays at pubs and casinos for butts they'd get the tobacco out of until they had enough to roll up into one regular cigarette.I work in a casino. We heard some stories of casinos going non-smoking during the Covid stuff but alas, not ours.Cause you still smoke in casinos.But like they have the smell of cigarettes mixed with the smell of perfume meant to mask the cigarettes but instead they just team up to gang rape your senses.I've visited a few places with indoor smoking in the past decade and it's always surprising how much work goes into accommodating smoking. The servers spend a few extra trips to the table just clearing dirty ashtrays and replacing clean ones.Like caughing?It really is lovely not having smallpox or the plague or leprosy! My grandpa always said \u201cI HAD all those things you all get vaccinated for.\u201d Life is good. I\u2019m also jazzed about air bags! I\u2019m jazzed about a lot of things.Never thought about how interesting has it been for wind instrument players to suck all that smoke irritating your lungs as you play.As a singer/drummer, what a difference it made to draw a clear breath.I see you are a person of culture. Cheers fellow trombone player.Looks like we\u2019re starting a ska band here.I have that exact memory.Very vivid to me too.That was gross, but smoking was definitely worse. I remember having massive headaches on flights from second hand smoke. They made the last 8 rows or something the smoking section, which obviously didn\u2019t work.You could smoke in the mall?Jeeeesus christI think its still an option where I live, but most restaurants have banned it as a house rule now.Traditionally, just like choosing the right beverage to accompany a specific meal, smoking a specific variety of boutique cigarette, cigar, shisha or hookah can be a form of molecular gastronomy to enhance certain meals.\n\nThis is completely different to lighting up a durry when your eating a $10 Parma, chips and pot of cheap beer.Digital screens kinda ruined physical buttons and knobs, didn\u2019t they? I always use the pulley arm at the casino even though it also works with a screen tap.I remember when McDonald\u2019s had smoking sections and little tin ashtrays imprinted with the Golden Arches. Nothing like going to eat a 2,500 calorie meal while sucking in second hand smoke.I was going to college in St. Louis in the early 2000s, and I remember my grandma taking me to a brand-new Applebee\u2019s that still has smoking and non-smoking sections. It was memorable only because they had installed these tall barriers between the sections and had big air filter things over the smoking section, but of course, it still stank. St. Louis County didn\u2019t ban indoor smoking until 2011, although I think by then a lot of restaurants has banned it anyway.I was a little kid when they got rid of smoking on airplanes but I remember it. There was a hilariously ineffective curtain between the sections.Took me a year of nagging to get my mom to stop smoking (I have asthma) but it was so, so worth it.Selfish, greedy, dumb, assholes.\n\nAka Republicans.I recently learned some people find the smell of cigarette smoke attractive, and I gagged just hearing that. I'd rather submerge my entire body--including my head--in raw sewage than be in the vicinity of a smoker.So many smokers truly don\u2019t care if there\u2019s people around who probably don\u2019t want to be breathing their smoke.I lived in DC starting in 2007 - smoking had been banned in bars and restaurants in DC in early 2007, but was not banned in bars and restaurants in Virginia until 2009. It was always so jarring to go out to a bar in Arlington, Virginia and see people smoking - just across the river, so it didn't feel like traveling somewhere, but obviously a totally different set of local laws.Still surprises me from time to time when they don't.  I should get out more...I'm not even from the US and even I  could guess which states wouldn't have the ban.Yep. There is no such thing as a non smoking section if there is a smoking sectionAt least in CA we had smoking sections in restaurants.  When I stepped into an Ohio restaurant with no ventilation, it was such culture shock.  I sat down at the bar and ordered my food to go.  It was so horrible.Interesting to know. I put it down to Oberlin drawing a lot of angsty/outsider/counter-culture types, or maybe it\u2019s angsty-outsider-counterculture types. Not a knock on Oberlin, I would have been happy if either kid had wanted to go there, _I_ would have liked to, myself.Ohio is such a shitty place to live and yet I'm still trying to move back to it. The slowness and boring nature of life calls to me for some stupid fucking reason.I remember seeing this when I was really young. Something along the lines of: \"why are they allowed to smoke in that section, when the smoke just travels over the low wall to the smoke free section\"\n\nI was confused. And rightly so I guess.Or non-smoking hotel roomsThe same in airliners.Reading through the comments, even county by county, let alone state by state, has dealt with smoking completely differently. I might just live in an area where it was tackled way earlier.Unfortunately there are enough rich people out there who couldn't care less about spending a \"measly\" $200 for the privilege of being able to smoke in their room. The fee should be a lot higher to cover your costs but it still wouldn't deter them.I saw recently, like one of those big concrete shrubbery planters near a mall, with a little cigarette bin pretty clearly placed in it.\n\nThe dirt in it was absolutely littered with cig butts even when a bin specifically for then right there. They were just that lazy or intentionally being douchebags. Some of these people are fucking vile.Solidarity! Sitting back there taking in shallow breaths because deeper ones were too uncomfortable.There\u2019s a documentary called \u201cThe Year The Earth Changed\u201d. It shows all of that around the world and how nature started to bounce back when humans finally started being quiet and stopped stressing out the entire planet during the shutdowns. \nThey do it in a much more uplifting and beautiful way than I just described. But it does make you think about how, as a species, we\u2019re pretty much the worst.\n\nedit: spellingNo one if forced to use ICE engines. I\u2019m 50 years old and American, and started driving when I was 16, but  I still lived a decade and a half not driving post 16 years old.\n\nWhere you live is a choice. There are cities with good public transport. You can choose to live close to work. You can choose to use public transport even if it takes longer. Or car pool.\n\nDoes that mean you don\u2019t get to take fun day trips, shopping is a PITA, and you probably don\u2019t get a nice little house in the suburbs? Yes. That is a choice too. I have a car, but I still realize that is a CHOICE.  Not having a car in the a lot of the US may be a super crappy choice, but let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s not a choice, when it clearly is.I think he is saying onece electric cars overtake ice cars. Not that no cars would be better.This week, someone who wanted to smoke in a restaurant asked me if it was okay. I said no and I was so grateful that he got up and smoked a bit further away. \n\nI said I wouldn\u2019t mind moving, but there were only three tables so there was no other place to sit.Fake service dogs aren\u2019t allowed but you aren\u2019t allowed to verify it\u2019s a service dog so fake service dogs are still allowed. \nOnly charge needed is registration and proof.I'm upvoting this (I don't know why people are poopooing) because although your remark has nothing to do with my statement, the neat thing is that if you're going to build castles in the sky, you can build them out of gold: \n\nWhy not have both? A government that wasn't forcing people into corporate slavery, opportunity for upward mobility, and a social fabric that included a love for equity and justice. Maybe even pay and work hours that scaled appropriately with productivity? \n\nNationalized healthcare? An infrastructure budget that didn't include our  warfare and prison industrial complex?Hence the banPassive diabetes isn\u2019t a thing.Ya but you eating junk food does not affect the other people in the restaurant smoking does.It was never forced upon anyone is an interesting take on the subject.\n\nI remember as a kid it being forced upon me a lot. Sure my parents could have made choices to avoid it in some cases but even then.\n\nI'm old enough that I remember it being okay to smoke on public transport, even if in some cases the general rule was for smokers to go to the back of the bus it made absolutely no difference in such a small space. I also had to use public transport to get to school every day. So it felt pretty forced to me.\n\nI remember at times we had to use Taxi's to get places as we didn't own a car, and it seemed like there was about a 9 out of 10 chance the Taxi driver was a smoker, so best case the car just absolutely stunk and it wasn't uncommon for the driver to light up during the journey. So since this was our only way to get to places like our local doctors surgery, it felt pretty forced to me. \n\nNot to mention the fact that back then smoking was allowed in literally every restaurant, so no... We weren't forced to go out to eat, but in your view it's perfectly fine that we just never did as to avoid people with a disgusting habit.\n\nI had a French teacher who smoked a pipe and was often finishing off between class smoke while we were still getting seated. So it feels pretty forced since I had no choice but to attend school and his class was a mandatory one.\n\nYour comparison to processed food is so ridiculous I won't even bother there. \n\nAn entire generation of kids won't have to be forced to breath in harmful materials, won't know what it's like to leave places absolutely stinking of smoke and won't have experiences ruined when some selfish idiot decides to stink up an entire room just because he can't be bothered walking a few feet to go outside but let's go back to that so you can have your freedom! Freedom is an interesting word to use here as well, because you do still have the freedom to smoke. You have the freedom to smoke in your house, or outdoors, or in your own car and many other places. Oh and by the way... No one is forcing you to go to pubs and restaurants that have banned smoking, that's a choice you make.i don\u2019t even understand the point of buying a new car if you\u2019re just going to coat the interior in tar. i bought a new car decades ago when i was a smoker, and went several months without smoking in it. then thought: wait, if im not willing to put smoke in my car, why am i putting it in me? and quit entirely.You only remember bars  I'm older than the average redditor and when I first started working at an office job, smoking was allowed inside. I remember there was a smoker who sat opposite an outspoken non-smoker. The non smoker had a desk fan and turned it on the smoker every time he lit up. \n\nI also remember sitting in a flight from the U.S to the U.K. The window seat was a designated smoking seat. The middle seat (right next to that smoking seat) was a non-smoking seat. I sat in the middle seat for hours with a chain smoker inches away from me.Wrong.  When you go to a bar that allows smoking you are choosing to be around smoke.  You have that choice just like you have the choice to drink.\n\nDon't want to drink? Don't drink.  Don't want second hand smoke?  Don't drink in a bar where smoking is allowed.\n\nYou are just selfish and want your own preferences dictated upon others at the expense of their (the bar owners) property rights.And yet it is.  A perfect example of tyranny of the majority.\n\nWhiny assholes getting government to diminish others' rights for their own convenience.My point about alcohol is that the people who wanted smoking banned was because they wanted to drink alcohol (one bad thing) while not being exposed to smoking (another bad thing).   It's understandable that people might prefer to limit their poisons to one, but it's somewhat hypocritical to screech about possible exposure to one poison while intentionally exposing themselves to the other.\n\nBut on the other point each person who enters the bar knows that smoking is allowed, so they can make a fully informed decision of the risk involved.   Nobody who willingly enters the bar can say they are being forcibly exposed to smoke, because they decided to go in there.  Conversely, third party victims of drunken drivers did not intentionally expose themselves to peril (unless you say that being on any public road is a choice equivalent to entering a private bar, which I would reject).  Given this, one could say that allowing drinking in bars is more dangerous to innocent people than allowing smoking in bars, because victims of drinking didn't have the choice to avoid the risk.100% yes one of the greatest injustices.\n\nCops killing unarmed civilians, when unjustified, is episodic.   It's not a policy voted on and enforced by law.\n\nNo knock raids have their purposes.   Book bans barely exist today and when they do exist they are banning pornographic material from children.\n\nThe smoking ban was a collective decision to take away property rights from some,  for the convenience of selfish people.  A case study on tyranny of the majority.\n\nAbsolutely indefensible then, and now.I guess you haven't been on a plane lately. does your life actually matter if more people are dying now? Why are you special? Lowest death at the lowest cost should be the goal. people can't control themselves and cigarettes kill them suddenly in their 60's. fat is a life long drain on the systemYes. Tobacco is nothing but a poison. And it poisons a lot more than the person who's using it, but they never care.Dude this was *super common* in the era of smoking in restaurants. My mom in particular did it all the damn time.\n\nIt's the rule of \"it figures.\" Like, you'll get tired of waiting for something, and you'll start something else in the meantime, and *right then* is when the thing you were waiting for happens. \n\nSo the idea you light a cigarette and because of \"it figures\" the food will likely come soon thereafter, forcing you to put out your cigarette before it's even close to done, wasting half a cigarette.\n\nYeah, it's kind of a superstition, but it was common.\n\n\"It figures\" theory is similar to the \"because fuck you that's why\" theory or the notion of \"karma.\"I have been to 3 casinos in about 12 years.  I\u2019ve had to walk to the smokey part to get to the non-smoking slots.  Where the smell was about 60% more tolerable.  I would gamble a shade more in person but not at the expense of my lungs.Not necessarily. My Great Great GMA lived to 103, Great Aunt, 96 and Grandma, 101. My doctor gets a little annoyed about my perfect blood pressure even. Not advocating smoking. Wearing a patch as we speak. I just like it a lot. That was just not a worthy shower thought as it doesn't affect everyone. Not even close..I\u2019m talking about car exhaust.\n\nWhen I was a kid teachers compared smoking cigarettes to inhale a tail pipe exhaust. Society banned indoor smoking, but the tail pipes still pollute. Bigger cars in average and more cars total. Lots more outdoor smoking going on than we even want to think about.You seem to be struggling with the \"not being an asshole\" bit on its own, what place are you in to be giving advice?Well good for you, deriving joy from the imagined suffering of strangers for daring to make life-choices other than your own.  You remind me of nothing more than the people who were happy that AIDS was mostly killing gays.Back in the day - after leaving the clubs at 2:00 AM - I used to go home and shower because I smelled so much like cigarette smoke.  Otherwise your pillow would stink like cigarettes for days.\n\nNext morning you'd pick up the clothes you wore and they smelled like an ashtray.  Better to leave them out on the porch so they didn't stink up the room, it was so bad.Born and raised in the states but always flew back to see my Irish cousins and grandparents over the summer (dads side). Both his parents were heavy smokers and my mom, apparently, in the 90\u2019s laid down an ultimatum of not ever bringing us to their house if they didn\u2019t quit smoking inside while we were there at the very least. Pretty bold but my mom is vehemently against smoking and second hand smoke exposure. Anyhow, my grandmother quit altogether. My grandfather dialed it back a lot and my grandmother stopped being able to stand the smell and made him go outside. \n\nMy aunts still talk about it and thank my mom for doing it. It\u2019s been almost 30 years and they credit the fact that my grandmother is still alive with that.I\u2019m a smoker/vaper and I enjoy a break from the heat and music to have a few minutes calm and chitchat.  Watching 80s entertainment now the cigarettes really stand out.I still DO smoke, and I would never go back to people being able to smoke indoors. At least outside you're not just hot boxing everyone and everything. And while my jacket will smell like smoke sometimes, the rest of my clothes don't because I'm not sitting in a room full of smoke for hours.\n\nThere are still some places where I'm from that allow smoking indoors where I'm from because of a mixture of grandfathering and separating the ventilation system from the rest of the building. I went to one years ago with my dad to smoke cigars on his birthday. I pretty much wanted to burn my clothes afterwards.Damn, I never connected the dots on why being a foodie has become such a thing.  It's because people can smell and taste their food again.Lol, how for decades we would hear how no one would go to the bars if smoking wasn\u2019t allowed. \n\nInstead, I became a karaoke diva!Not only does it make everything smell like ass, it changes the taste of food because it lingers in your nose.  Entire generations of people had food that could have tasted so much better.I'm American and I happened to be over for a wedding the weekend it happened. At midnight we all moved outside with our drinks and continued to smoke. I still have the ashtray from the bar that we used that night.I visited in 2005 and it was already illegal then.It's... now and smoking is still allowed in a number of types of establishments in Virginia (most notably clubs, casinos, and restaurants that meet certain criteria).Still is. 21 and up bars only.Kentucky it's allowed in bars between certain hours. My favorite breakfast is a shitty diner in covington that's cash only, a hearty breakfast costs about 4 bucks, and ashtrays are snatched away rhe second the clock strikes 8 am (or whatever the cutoff time is)TN allows it in bars that are 21+ at *all* times. If they ever allow someone under 21 in, they can\u2019t allow smoking. There are a few bars around that follow that rule.\"smoking or non-smoking?\"\n\n\"Non-smoking.\"\n\n\"Okay, have a seat right here at the threshold between the two sections, where there are no barriers to keep the smoke from invading your lungs.\"Yep. Good thing my parents conditioned me by smoking in the car with the windows up or I wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle those restaurants.That always cracked me up. They would have that divider thing set up but the smoked came over to the non-smoking section just fine.Initially it was almost worse (here in Sydney) because the outdoor tables became the smoking tables. So you could never get an outdoor seat at some nice beachside caf\u00e9 unless you wanted to choke to death in the concentrated fug. \n\nNow there\u2019s no smoking anywhere in caf\u00e9s and it\u2019s brilliant.And to get in and out of the pool, you walk through the peeing section.Eddie Izzard had a line in his comedy show in the late 90s about CA banning smoking in bars:\n\n>My God, what have you been smoking? You haven't been smoking in a bar in California, that's for sure! Because you can't! Yes, no smoking in bars now, and soon no drinking and no talking!\n\nIt was considered so wild and crazy, but it turns out that for the most part, people love it.If banning alcohol wasn't able to end the bars, banning tobacco never had a chance, lol.I'm a few years older, and there was a window of time where NJ and NY had different rules. I can't remember which state banned smoking first, but I much preferred those bars! With the smoking ones, I'd have to shower when I got home to get the smell out of my hairYeah, why would anyone go to bars if there wasn't a an addictive, soothing, unhealthy, invigorating thing to do there?I remember when it got banned and I overheard 2 guys on the subway talking about being told they cant smoke in the bar.  he scoffed and said 'next thing you know they'll say we can't drink either'.  I could only laugh36 here. It was a massive deal in Utah when it happened (there is a rather large counter culture there). So for sometime a number of became \u201cclubs\u201d where you purchased a membership, then everyone could legally smoke inside of those. Didn\u2019t last long before they gave up and people adjusted though. I still remember vividly going out to eat and being asked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking, when were were a family with several kids. So funny to think of now but didn\u2019t feel weird at all then.I'm low 30s and distinctly remember smoking cigarettes indoors at Dennys when I was 17Remember the Sellers cafeterias with glass enclosed rooms for smokers? There was always a think layer of smoke in those hot boxes.I'm 50 and remember airplanes having smoking sections. No partition between the sections though so imagine how well that worked.Lol, I've been to Kingman exactly once and this describes it so well.I lived down the road in Lake Havasu City for my teenage years.  Its about the same.I was just there!  And this is *exactly* what I was thinking!  All those kids in Cali just need to stop by the plinko sections of a casino then head over to Kingman.Tell me the cars are also 80s cars. \ud83d\ude05Honestly Vegas blows my mind at how casual people are about smoking. I went to Vegas last fall for the first time in twenty years and I had forgotten that basically every casino just smells disgusting. Definitely curtailed how much money I would have spent because it was slightly difficult to breath on the floor.Right? Like fuck. Some people want to wear neons, listen to some jams, and dream of something different. But every time they do someone breaks down their door and screams \"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT RONALD REAGAN\"[deleted]Wait.. Is vapourwave a genre of music? I thought it was just that 80s, pink and cyan, the sun is made of parallel lines aesthetic. In gonna have to go listen to it.Let's get some welfare slaves to clean the bar.This is very well put. Feels like finally finding the words to describe something I've known in my gut for years.There is also a mental health tie to nicotine as well.PhillyProbably every town\n\nI'm in CanadaI just wanna say as a sewer rat myself that I used to do this and it's actually not bad at all unless the butts are wet. Another similar sewer rat concept is that especially at universities or public events people throw away perfectly good food you can just collect from the bins, often still in packaging.\n\nI'm reformed now lmaoMost of my family has worked in the Atlantic City Casinos at one point, the ones who made a career out of it had had at least 1 bout with cancer.  Consider a career change for your health.Not here in Oregon. I mean, they have smoking sections, but it\u2019s just a room off to the side. The main areas are all smoke free. At least every casino I\u2019ve been to (in Oregon).>gang rape your senses\n\nDid I just discover a new fetish today?It's wild manTo be fair, I was a server when there used to be smoking  in my state (I\u2019m in the US) and EVERY SERVER WANTED THE SMOKING SECTION.\n\nSmokers are usually drinkers so their checks were  always high dollar, hence more tip. A lot more.\n\nAnd smokers rarely had kids and that means \u2014 no annoying kids cups and kid clean up, and also FAMILIES are terrible tippers.\n\nSMOKING SECTION all the way baby!!!Abu Dhabi airports smoking area is in the only pub on site lol so gross sitting in there just to drink a beerSpeaking of air bags and auto safety, before seat belt laws, apparently it was fairly common for kids to fall out of car windows and get run over. I\u2019m not even talking about getting ejected in accidents \u2014 just a kid hanging out the window suddenly falls out when the driver makes a turn and gets squished by either the rear tires or the car behind them. And it still took until the 90s to convince parents that kids had to be buckled in car seats!I'm old enough that I got chicken pox as a kid. That alone was bad enough, vaccines are great.It's fascinating though, we have this illusion that things are pretty much the same in our lives except we're getting older with time, but in reality even going a couple years back things would be differentRIP Roy Castle, lung cancer attributed to this exact thing - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_CastleBasically made them a smoker indirectly.Big bands puffing smoke like a steel millYou could smoke anywhere and everywhere. Doctors used to smoke in the examination room.You could smoke in malls where I live.\n\nI remember when smoking bans started, before a bunch of towns amalgamated into the Regional Municipality our city is now, one town banned indoor smoking before the others. A friend met me at the mall in that town, and lit a smoke as soon as he entered, because he could in his town.\n\nI think maybe you couldn't smoke in the stores, just the mall and food court. So really it was mostly getting on merchandise by the doors. But I can't really remember. I was a kid for most of that time.You could smoke anywhere and everywhere. Watch the original Ghostbusters movie. It's a documentary of all the types of buildings you could smoke in the early 80's.Was born in 87 and I remember people smoking in malls in the early 90s.High-schools used to have a smoking lounge for students evenYou could smoke everywhere. It was a kid at the time and remember it being awful when you\u2019d walk past someone smoking cause it just lingeredI remember shopping in a store in Madrid that had ridiculously expensive cashmere sweaters... being folded by a girl who had a 3cm ash on her lit cigarette as she leaned over them. Different world.I remember when they banned smoking at our local mall.  My parents both smoked and we didn\u2019t go back to the mall for like 2 years.Also to piggy back on the person who said they had a smoking lounge in HS. I'm not even THAT old. Even though I say I am. Because it was \"legal\" at the time to have cigarettes (but not buy them) at 16, if you were 16 or older you could go across the street from the school (technically not school property) and smoke at my school. They didn't care if you had cigarettes. They were hard on kids under 16 with them. They got tighter about the time I was 18ish and closer to graduating. We are talking they got tighter in 05. so not THAT long ago. It was called the \"smoking tree\". \n\nSo yeah, the school let you walk across the street during school hours like on lunch to smoke.\n\nAlso, my younger memories of waffle house are the servers and the cooks smoking while they work. \n\nPeople smoked everywhere. In the malls, in restaurants, in motels, inside of some jobs, in hospitals, it was just cigarettes everywhere in the 90s. I can't imagine the amount of second hand smoke[deleted]If someone wants to smoke at home to enhance their eating experience with a specific dish, that is their choice. So be it.\n\nUnfortunately, cigarettes affect everyone around them, eating a wide variety of non-specific food. Smoking in a restaurant kind of negates the entire concept of matching a specific food to a certain style of smoking.Hah that\u2019s so true. I also crank down the arm on slots. I want to know it was my strength and precision that won me the jackpotI remember the oldsters that would order a single coffee (free refills) and sit and smoke for hours, sometimes playing chess or cards. As broke teens we started doing it too, and suddenly there was a time limit but it was only enforced on us.Congrats, how'd you manage that? I've been trying to get my mom to quit for a couple decades with no luckThere are many other states that are slow and boring but dont allow smoking in restaurants.>But it does make you think about how, as a species, we\u2019re pretty much the worst\n\nmeh, every species would do this if they could, that's not what makes us special. what makes us special is that we CAN. we're the best, we're just the best at making the planet barely inhabitable for everything else.Props to guy for being courteous. A lot of smokers know it sucks to be around us while we're smoking, but so few of us actually do anything about distancing which is bullshit. Like, oh, it's inconvenient to move, sure, but it's more inconvenient and disrespectful to others to just assume everyone wants to be, or even can *literally handle*, sucking down some secondhand.If a service dog is acting up, you're allowed to ask them to leave.If there are 33 bars in your area, and 10 of them allow smoking inside, then maybe go to one that doesn\u2019t allow it? That way no second hand smoke, there ya go!Smoking in restaurants was terrible too, I hated having to walk past huge clouds of smoke to get to my table or the bathroom. I've also gotten cigarette ashes in my food somehow when I was a kid! Our family also couldn't go to restaurants that were late on banning indoor smoking because my brother was really sick when he was young and couldn't be around smoke. It's not all about bars, in fact there are laws in my old state where you CAN still smoke in bars and pool halls etc, as long a certain percentage of what they serve is alcoholIt wasn't just bars. It was pretty much everywhere. Maybe if y'all had some restraint and didn't feel the need to blow your stench at everyone at every opportunity...\n\nYou probably think smoking with kids in the car in just fine too lmao.[deleted]>I guess you haven't been on a plane lately\n\n\nNope but being temporarily uncomfortable still isn't comparable to involuntarily inhaling other people's cigarette smoke.\n\n\n>does your life actually matter if more people are dying now? Why are you special?\n\n\n\nMy life, and every other person's matters regardless of the amount of people dying, what silly questions. \n\n\n\n>Lowest death at the lowest cost should be the goal.\n\n\n\nThe goal on the smoking ban was making cleaner air for everyone in public spaces, banning fat people does what for the population as a whole? (outside of my next counterpoint)\n\n\n>fat is a life long drain on the system\n\n\nSo are a mile long list of ailments present from birth to death but surely you don't endorse banning mental and physical birth defects? And also, fat doesn't equal lazy or unhealthy anymore than skinny equals active or healthy. I can list 10 extremely common reasons a person could have excess weight and be unable to lose it. No amount of dieting or exercise can make people with these issues lose weight. Sometimes medicine helps, sometimes surgery, sometimes people just have to live with the fact that due to reasons beyond their control they'll always be fat. \n\n\nAnd before any assumptions are made, I'm a former cigarette smoker and current vaper from a family of smokers and my heaviest was 9 months pregnant with 186lbs at 5'4\", I usually clock in between 130 and 150 depending on the time of year. So not a sanctimonious ex smoker or fat person.If it\u2019s in their own homes then it\u2019s only poisoning them. Leave them alone man ffsSurvivorship bias.Oh. Yes. But at the same time, car fumes were actually significantly worse around the time when cigarettes were allowed in restaurants. There's a lot more regulation around car emissions now. I do fully agree though that car emissions are a huge problem for the environment and for our healthLol, nope. Not even close. Excuse me while I go run a mile without coughing my lungs out.[deleted]I remember coming home in the early hours after a night out. That moment when you\u2019re in the middle of taking your top of and have your whole head inside your shirt and the sheer stink of cigs and no air around you\u2026.so horrible.My partner and I would have to weigh how much we wanted to go dance to live music vs how much we wanted to do extra laundry that week. Indoor smoking ban has been so nice.Yeah, I remember drunkenly throwing my clothes on the floor after a night out, then having my carpet stink because of the contact with the clothes. And I was never a smoker.It took three washes in the one shower to get cigarette smoke out of long hair after nightclubbing.Back in the day.  LOL.  This happened to me on Wednesday.Yes! Early adulthood club memories in Buenos Aires are coming to mind hard right now! God, I can smell it just by thinking about it.I remember playing gigs at bars and my jeans would stink until I washed themDamn how old is grandma?Yeah, now when someone lights up a smoke in a piece of media it\u2019s usually a very specific character choice, whereas 50 years ago it was jut a thing people assumed most adults did.NOW the recipes I see from the 70s make sense, they couldn't taste that garbage!!Hey, they are still looking for that...Well, tobcco is still one of virginia's exports rightt?Wait, it's now right now?\n\nShit. I lost track of time. I thought now was later.One bowling alley near me in VA has a smoking room. I thought it was illegal but apparently not. It's kinda the shittier bowling alley in town but I think that's cool in a way that fits their vibe. I also used to be in the league there as a kid. \n\nThey never play Kid Rock's \"Cowboy Baby \" anymore though. There's a jukebox there and it used to be a running joke that people would play it again like as soon as it ended. I'm talking for years they did. The once proud tradition seems to have died.That is wild. Where I live has banned smoking for near 20 years now.canadian winter driving with smoker parents sucked balls. not only could you not breathe, but the window would be rolled down to flick the ashes when its at least -20C and you're going at least 80-90km/hI got burned by other people\u2019s cigarettes a few times on a dance floor in the \u201880\u2019s.This serves to remind us that dumb and loud people have always been around and often had a loud and obnoxious voice.I\u2019ve never smoked but I do strangely miss the background smoke smell.  Now pubs/clubs smell of piss and energy drinks.Funny thing is, coffee shops are essentially the same thing but replace alcohol with caffeine. And they were created as an alternative for just that reason, too.Those two voted for trumpWaffle House hash browns without the ash just aren\u2019t the same.Good god I hate that place an unreasonable amount for how little time I\u2019ve spent thereJesus, that\u2019s a hard area.My grandparents had a place in Fort Mohave. Fun to visit but never wanted to live there.For sure.  Its claim to fame is being on Route66.  It\u2019s also in Mohave county of Az, which requires zero emissions testing.  So now mix those two and you get it all. \n\nThe no exhaust on old pieces of shit.  The grandma still driving that duster around town.  The toothless coal rollers.  The FrankenTrucks of all kinds of parts and pieces from different model years and manufacturers.  \n\nAll of which have some flag or sticker about how cultish they are.  Then you will see the lone hold out hippie bus here or there.   Don\u2019t forget all the old white rich dudes with their vintage cars and trucks as well.  They live in a shit stucco box house in that town but have 250k in classic cars in the garage because route66 is their entire identity.    It really is the Cracker Jack prize of shit hole towns the US has to offer.Remarkably aptSTEM came after the elder millennials who were told \u201cjust get a bachelors degree in whatever and you\u2019ll land a six-figure job in no time!\u201d graduated to find no jobs and the boomers mocking them for having \u201cunderwater basket weaving\u201d degrees.No, this was what was implied to us and advocated to us through all the \"edutainment\" and tropes. Think Bill Nye, Beakmans world, how the nerdy guy with the tech won out (WarGames, ferris bueller's day off), etc. I'm not talking about the adults in the 80s or 90s, I'm talking about the kids and what they experienced. \n\nI can understand people that were adults at the time not understanding it. I know I won't be able to understand what people that were born after 2000 experienced during that time. As a child, everything is new and untainted by acquired knowledge and most of the good stuff gets remembered while the bad is forgotten. It doesn't *matter* what the reality of the time was, it is the **feeling** of the time vaporwave tries to emulate.[I like this take on it. Shows some of the history of it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_T1nkER3vA)Literally came here to answer this.My uncle raked in tips dealing blackjack and finding the job should have been a massive boon in his family's life; the only issue was that it got him hooked back on Cigs after kicking them for about a decade and now he's too sick to work at all.> before seat belt laws\n\nThank you Ralph Nader.\n\nI remember as a  kid people rebelling against the seatbelt thing. My dad would drive around with a beer between his legs, no seatbelt and all. Things were so different not very long ago.My little brother did a flip over my dad's arm onto his head in the floorboard from a standing position when dad hit the brakes and flung his arm out to 'protect' my bro.  Dad converted to seatbelt usage after that.Man, as someone who is currently recovering from shingles, get the singles vaccine.\n\nIf you've ever had chicken pox, shingles is living in your body, on a nerve. When it decides to flare up one day, you get cold sore style blisters along your body wherever the affected nerve runs.\n\nI'm almost over it. I only have one 1/3\" blister remaining. \n\nI've been stabbed in the eye and this is still a close second for most pain I've ever been in.I mean, something like 90% of adults in the US have had chicken pox at some time. The vaccine was introduces very recently, sometime in the middle 90s.Same with Christopher Reeve\u2019s wife. She fought so hard for him and got diagnosed with cancer as a non smoker but she was also a singer in nightclubs back in the day   That\u2019s now I believe she thought she got it.grocery stores had them at the end of the isles as well.Different countries have different laws. In the UK and australia its completely illegal federally.I agree whole-heartedly.\nAny dining experience is ruined by some scumbag smoking cigarette made of stale floor sweepings, but *certain* cigars, cigarillos, cigarettes coupled with an appropriate (usually spiced) dish can improve the experience.\n\nI am definitely not saying that some dirty bogan with a pack of Holiday 50s up their sleeve should be allowed to smoke near anyone else, let alone near anyone who is trying to consume food or beverage.\n\nIt is the exception that proves the rule.Ignoring the eye rolls, scoffs and sighs. I will say you have to want to quit to be able to, she said it was like hell. She had quit a couple times before and one time for 2 years but stress brought her back. Now I think it\u2019s been 6 months.Yeah but are they also filled with nothing but corn fields and are flat as hell? Probably not.We are talking about privately owned bars and restaurants here, where everyone can choose not to enter, not \"Pretty much everywhere\", wherever that is.  LMAO.\n\n\"Y'all\".  LMAO. >banning fat people does what for the population as a whole? (outside of my next counterpoint)\n\nThink of all the problems being fat causes. Think of all the resources they are just wasting to be fat. a large percentage of the west is fat. Think of all that waste\n\n> And also, fat doesn't equal lazy or unhealthy\n\nfat is unhealthy period. in fact overweight is unhealthy period, even if it is muscle. it strains your joints and organs. Being overweight is not healthy. if you cared about your health and the health of others as much as you claim, you would be against being overweight as much as you are against smoking. I've known some big people that weren't lazy but the doctor also refused to replace their knees (at 45) until they lost weight.\n\nthe point still stands. we aren't saving any lives banning smoking and letting people be so large they won't fit in a standard airline seat. maybe your air seems cleaner but more people are dying of being over size than they ever have smoking. When people smoke, they tend to just die, when people are fat they have diabetes, joint problems, mobility problems, organ problems, problems cleaning themselves, problems wiping themselves, problems resulting from the previous problems, they have to have special toilets, special hospital beds, special clothes, all of those cost more, it's not like the food they eat is any cheaper than some cigs or a vape. More people die every year from being fat than they ever did from smoking. We are saving 30k a year *maybe* down from the 2005 max not smoking anywhere while 10x that die from their size and you defend their right to be slobs\n\nalso lung caner probably went up due to atmospheric nuclear bomb tests, not cigarettes. not to say you should smoke, but I would rather people with poor impulse control smoke than be massive. for the record, i think cigarettes are disgusting.Is it only poisoning them? Is it? I lived for 20 years next to a smoking neighbor. And every single fucking day my room smelled of cigarettes, every fucking time he went on his balcony for a little puff. My lungs are fucked up enough as is, I'm in no mood to deal with cancer at the age of 30 because nobody gives a shit about the other person. \n\n\nWherever I go to try to get away from them, it follows me around. A park? Smoke. A zoo? Smoke. Work? Smoke. Last week I found cigarette butts in the forest I live next to. A goddamn forest. Smokers have not one ounce of respect for anyone around them and I sincerely wish smoking was banned all together.Reminded me of old 'staff rooms' the walls were literally yellow, the were white once upon a time.\n\nCrazy that hospitals used to have smoking rooms too.\n\nEdit: I forgot that you used to be allowed to smoke on planes too but only international flights. Seems like a whole different world.And like all progress it was met with resistance. I remember after it passed and there was a dude smoking his cigarette in front of the manager of a bar telling him he couldn't do that anymore, like he thought he was going to be the Rosa Parks of cigarettes or something...At my grandparents' house they had a sort of bar separating the kitchen and dining room. There were lights hanging from the ceiling with these dark brown colored lampshades above them.\n\nThey had some fuzz stuck to them so I went to clean them.\n\nI figured the dirt and fuzz would come off and a nice brass metal would be revealed.\n\nNope.\n\nThey were WHITE. Like, awkwardly-bright, pure WHITE white. My grandma smoked *so* much over several years that a thick\u2010ass layer of brown SLUDGE had covered the shades and attracted hair and dust into it.\n\nIt took bleach and a scrub brush to get it all off.One time, when looking for a new apartment, I was informed that the tenant in the unit coming available had lived there for 8 years and smoked like a freight train. The landlord showed me the outside of the unit and the blinds were a nasty orangish-brown compared to the other units whose blinds were white. Cleaning crews replaced the carpets and some of the appliances, and painted the walls and ceiling before I moved in. Except, they didn\u2019t wipe down any of the dark brown cabinets.\n\nSo like I always do with every new place, I wiped all surfaces that I would likely touch with a cleaning wipe - shelves, cabinet doors, handles, floors , etc. The wipes from the cabinet doors were the same orangish-brown as the blinds. If you took a hot shower with the bathroom door closed, then orangish-brown streaks would start coming down the walls near the ceiling. The tar from the cigarette smoke literally started seeping out of the walls. I was disgusted.Ha! When my Grandparents died and their house was being sold the one thing I took was this oversized wooden fork and spoon that was on the wall of the dining room. There was of course a perfect smoke outline of them on the wall when I took them down.Cigarettes were regarded as natural and necessary as coffee.  Who would ban coffee from everywhere?Ugh, yeah the stench. When I worked in a pub, I still lived at home and the only shower was the en suite in my mum's room (main bathroom only had a bath, and the hot water wasn't on at night). Couldn't shower when I got home on late shifts. The next morning I'd always feel disgusting and be coughing like crazy. I was so fricking relieved when the ban came in! No more being trapped behind the bar with 20 smokers blowing their crap in to my faceI was a musician in the late 80s/early 90s and I did the same. The stench was stomach-turning. Even my guitars stank.My mum took over a pub in 2002, the first thing I wanted to tackle was cleaning the ceilings. \n\nI grabbed some sugar soap and started going at it. It was about 3 levels of sticky residue deep before you found the ceiling. \n\nI managed about 2 metres square of ceiling before I had to give up. We had a clean square piece of ceiling in the back room for about a year before it went back to its \u201cnormal\u201d colour. \n\nMy mum bought some fancy extractors after she moved in to reduce the smoke for the customers and more importantly, the staff. The filters had to be cleaned once a month. \n\nThe pub had a flat upstairs we all lived in. I stopped smoking around 2004 due to the smell of smoke, it seeped through the ceiling into the bedrooms. \n\nThe obvious downside, in our town at least, was it killed the trade off. So many upsides to the ban but it definitely had an effect on my mum\u2019s business.I always had to do the same if I was around cigarettes. I absolutely cannot sleep with any hint of the smell. Seems to cling to my hair so stubbornly.Ugh, it was so grossTime traveler!  We are on to you!She'll be 47 this springTobacco companies used to pay film makers to include smoking in films.Indeed, it is. One of the restaurant exceptions is basically restaurants at places that produce tobacco products.I have a nose.And people are very resistant to change / people will always react poorly to change.Sacha Baron Cohen trolled that city once. Its a backwards town full of grumpy far right old people and he had a town hall meeting where he told everyone that he was going to have a mosque built there. Its worth a watchHavasu is Beautiful \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fGen x checking in.  Undergrad in psych.  Wanted to got to the military or trade school.  Mom had none of it - college for me.  It worked out, but I was making jack shit until I was in my 30s while my buddy was pulling 3x my salary in HVAC after a two year school.\nI probably would have going to college later, but likely for something that really interested me after having some life experience.  That\u2019s all I wanted - a break to figure out what to do.I\u2019m a 90\u201ds kid and I have no clue what you are talking about.Thanks, that's very interesting. I've been listening since my comment and I'm enjoying it a lot. Chill and reminds me or old Sierra games for some reason.My grandma got shingles. It's awful. Last I checked you couldn't get the shingles vax until your 60s, although it certainly seems like it's becoming an issue for younger people.> I've been stabbed in the eye\n\nWhatI'm knocking on the door of 50 and I've been counting down the days until I can get my vaccine. My MIL had it twice and my mother had ocular shingles. Seems like unbridled misery.Yeah I had chicken pox in the 90s, all I remember was the itch and calamine lotion.>very recently, sometime in the middle 90s.\n\nOh dear, we've got another one. Someone else want to tell them?Yup, I know. I was born in 89, my brother in 93 and the vaccine wasn't really available before I caught chicken pox but it was available when my brother was in elementary school, and he would have gotten the vax if he hadn't caught it from me when he was an infant. This is how my brother got chicken pox twice, lol.I have to tell my parent friends that \u201cyes you can *vaccinate* for chicken pox now\u201d so they don\u2019t go take their kid to a fucking pox party. For some reason, chicken pox vaccines don\u2019t get much attention.\n\nThe vaccine\u2019s existed for over *30 years*.I mean just existing back then exposed you to smokeIt's still allowed in Japan. Thankfully recently more and more places have simply not allowed smoking, so I just avoid the places that allow smoking. If someone invites me to go out I will just refuse if they're going somewhere that allows smoking indoors.I see you've never been to iowa nor the great plains.Sucks to suck, bitch.Let me make this simple and clear rather than breaking down your ridiculous tangent. \n\n\nSomeone being fat has absolutely ***zero impact*** on mine or the general population's health and wellbeing nor does it infringe on my rights to not be fat. Fat people aren't forcing me to eat myself into obesity. Them eating themselves to death doesn't impact my personal health or the health of the population at large. \n\n\nI may have to be a bit uncomfortable on **public** transportation like planes and trains, but creepy men, crying babies, unwashed people and a myriad of other unpleasant things await on public transportation and it's something we learn to deal with them as a temporary inconvenience. \n\n\nNow on the other hand, someone smoking in an enclosed space like a restaurant or an airplane absolutely infringes upon mine and the general population's health and wellbeing. Smoking indoors forces me to inhale everyone else's smoke, regardless of whether I want to or not. Them smoking inside impacts my personal health and the health of the population at large. \n\n\nThere is no comparison, we get it, you don't like fat people, but you're comparing apples to orangutans.\n\nEdit: no orangutans is ***not*** a typo, that's how far off your comparison is.Lol my uncle was just telling me about when he was in his 20s and had surgery on his tailbone (so was around 1970s.) He had to stay in hospital for ages and his Dad used to visit after work with a few beers and they would all be there drinking and smoking on the wards.When I was in the navy there was small social room with a TV in the berthing it was the only area you were allowed to smoke in and would sit like 12 guys if they were almost in each others laps. People smoking in it 24/7. \n\nWe thought it was painted grey. Someone moved a placard one day. We found out the room was sort of a bright sky blue. The tobacco much coating the room was grey.Hospitals used to have ashtrays in the hallway!!It's hard to imagine now. When I was in highschool I had a teacher who was an older lady. She was never a smoker and talked about how much she hated the staff rooms before the smoking ban. Because she'd be in there and everyone would be smoking and she came out smelling like she \"smoked sixty a day\". \ud83d\ude05>whiyebonve \n\nFor a second I legitimately thought this was some fancy word for a shade of white paint>like he thought he was going to be the Rosa Parks of cigarettes\n\nThis slayed me hahahahaThe smoking bandit.It suddenly occurs to me that rampant smoking may be the reason that dark wood panelling and dull yellow-ish hues were so popular in the 70s. It would have disguised the nicotine stains.My current place is like that. When it gets really humid in the spring before I turn on the AC, the whole place smells like a bowling alley, which is one of the few places I was growing up that still let you smoke indoorsAnd still young at heartSure to visit. It can be a difficult area to grow up in.DittoThat's the feeling. It's something that just reminds you of the time somehow by the instruments and motifs they use. So suddenly a song will be like from an old video game you remember or something you'd heard once in a commercial.\n\nArtists WILL sample songs from that time, but there are new songs that sound straight from the time if you were in a mall or watching the whether station. Saint Pepsi's song \"Enjoy Yourself\" takes a Michael Jackson song, takes his voice, multiplies it, lowers and raises the individual voices, then layers them so it's like a \"Boys 2 men\" RnB sound. It's quite fun all around while being super chill.\n\nSome good mixes so you don't have to find playlists and they flow well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea_UOPzuyZU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUfiW3W1KY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1iS-_EQMGE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ZKYrAi8NQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYSlY_Jt38w\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOwrDLoma2wMy Dr says your insurance may not cover it before 50. \n\nI'm not 50 yet. My wife's not 40. If it's not insanely expensive, we're *both* getting the vaccine soon as I'm over this.\n\nMy folks immediately went out and got it, like the day after I sent them pics of my face.I don't want to move to Iowa it's exactly the same as Ohio.being fat is worse for the public than you having to breathe some smoke, it's not even close. how does breathing smoke actually affect your health unless you have asthma? people having been smoking for thousands of years. for thousands of years the only fat people were kings and the wealthy. [people paid money to see a fatman in a freakshow that is pretty much your average american today]( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b1ot5/this_guy_was_considered_so_fat_in_the_1880s_he/). It's only recently that we got so fat and had so many health problems. it's cruel to let people be fat. You think breathing some smoke is bad, imagine having to get your groceries in a power chair. having fat kids should be considered child abuse.My dad had 3 heart attacks one weekend in the late 90s and his buddies brought him beer and a carton of smokes to his hospital room the Sunday after he was brought back to life. \n\nAnd you have the audacity to ask me what I learned from my mistakes....?Planes, including commercial airplanes use to have ashtrays in the cockpit and everywhere else.\n\nIt's funny because they used to have ashtray fires on aircraft before and it never even got mentioned in accident investigation reports. I think the first mention was when pilots were distracted by an ashtray fire and a crash resulted some while afterward. But they didn't consider the ashtray fire to be a threat or cause of the accident, it was just mentioned in the report since it was on the tape recording and they had to log the events prior to the accident.\n\nIt wasn't semi-restricted until the 80s, and eventually led to a full ban on any flight entering/leaving the US in 2000. China recently banned it on all flights.Banks too. I have these weird memories of going there with my mom and they'd have these huge ashtrays on top of the trashcans, and they also had a few butts too.\n\nMy country actually just banned smoking in the street too so I unintentionally have been smoking a lot less than a few weeks ago. It's kinda wild.[Doctors](https://i.imgur.com/jlJPaW8.jpg) and [physicians](https://i.imgur.com/RceXhhi.jpg) and even [just as a random gift to the \u2018rents](https://i.imgur.com/Cf8fZwb.jpg).Thought it was a Whitesnake and Jon Bon Jovi fusion tribute bandIt's a typo, right?Hold on, I gotta know. What did you learn from your mistakes?Airplanes still have ash trays to this day, albeit not everywhere but just in the lav.Oh I love it when they pretended smoke sections on airplanes did anythingHaha, yeah, 'white once'.Based on where I am in life, not much.",

Contact a lawyer and accountant...There are no powerball billionaires, because the government taxes them like they should real billionaires.Well considering the taxes they gotta pay, they\u2019re powerball multi-millionaires instead\n\nEdit: Did not expect all these up-votes, thanks all!!!Ever hit one of these huge lotteries where you'll have hundreds of millions after taxes. Do this. \n\nSet aside like 50 million for yourself. Create a tax empty charity. Give the rest to that charity and put it in long term high interest securities and safe dividend paying stocks. Write the minimum checks needed to other chairites to retain charity tax exempt status. Train your children or someone else worthy to take over when you die. Set it up so they can Draw a nice middle class salary for managing it. They grow the money, give to good causes, and make sure the endowment never goes below the original amount(with inflation figured). The money lasts forever. Your kids and their kids and so on have financial security without becoming trust fund brats blowing it on coke and Miami hookers. \n\nYou still have tens of millions to spend. The government never gets their gruby hands on that money again. Except for middle class bracket income taxes on the charity managers.The votes and comments here tell me everything I need to know about reddit economics lolYes and no. \n\nThe economy needs consumption but it also needs investment.\n\nAn economy where people aren\u2019t consuming experiences a recession. \n\nAn economy where people aren\u2019t investing experiences a correction or market crash. \n\n\nThe two are interrelated but distinctly different. A reduction in consumption and recession might convince investors to flee. A market correction might destroy consumer confidence.I think \u201cregular\u201d billionaires at least employee people, instead of just blowing it all because of newly acquired wealth by giving it away and having lavish things. I\u2019ve never really thought about it though because a billion dollars is a hard thing to graspHow do you figure?\n\nMost billionaires don't actually have the money, it's either a reflection of their company's success or a result of a successful investment, which is used to expand business.\n\nLottery winners historically blow money.Actually there is no way.  Billionaires like Bill Gates Tim Cook Mark Cuban and virtually every one of them became billionaires by creating companies that hire thousands upon thousands of people.  Many of these people can afford to live or have good careers based on that.\n\nI made my entire living for 40 years off of the work of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs (who I couldn't stand) and never worked for either one of them directly.\n\nJust about everyone who works in it or has a computer that they use at work owes their career to the pioneers that are now the billionaires.\n\nIn my lifetime I have worked to help poor people but I've never worked for a poor person.I wish we considered money hoarding in the same category as hoarding anything else. It's a mental illness.Most certainly the opposite is true.  Most billionaires and near billionaires made their money by creating business that immediately employ several million people in the US.   Those millions of people buy cars, houses, food and other items using the money they made from their job that billionaires created.  Let's not forget that millions more jobs are created by businesses to support the companies that were started by people who are now billionaires.  Then there are businesses created to support the businesses that were created to support the businesses that were created by the billionaires.  This keeps on trickling down multiple levels.\n\nThen there are all the businesses created by people to provide goods and services to the people who are employed by the businesses created by said billionaires.  etc, etc.\n\nNone of this takes into account all the small business owners who are millionaires at various levels who created the majority of all jobs in the US.\n\nPowerball billionaires and millionaires mostly put their money in investments and spend a good bit of cash locally but they don't even put a small dent in the economy compared to what millionaires and billionaire business owners do.Categorisation based on wealth, race or gender is pretty bad for the economyThis is probably one of the worst shower thoughts I have seen.\u201cTraditional\u201d billionaires (generally speaking) created companies, that created value to the economy in the form jobs and revenue and GDP growth. Those companies also pay corporate taxes and provide benefits to their employees.\n\nI\u2019m not sure there is a correlation between \u201cpowerball billionaires\u201d and philanthropy. Firstly there aren\u2019t many of them to begin with. Second, we don\u2019t know who they are often so it\u2019s entirely plausible they have chosen to give none of it away and spend lavishly/recklessly. There is evidence that lottery winners often go broke and don\u2019t spend responsibly (70% of the time).\n\nSo.. I actually am not sure this is correct.\n\nhttps://www.lovemoney.com/galleries/64958/lottery-winners-who-won-millions-but-ended-up-with-nothingOk serious question.. 10 year Treasury being at 4% currently. Powerball lumpsum would be lowball 500m after taxes. Couldn't you just throw it all in the 10 year Treasury and live off a cool 20 million return every year for at least the next 10 years?\n\nI'd maybe throw half in that and the other half in s&p and maybe throw 10 mil asideYes in the fact they are taxed at the highest rate allowable (almost impossible to hide lottery/gambling winnings).  They also are more likely to pay sales tax on a lot of expensive products.  \n\nBut most will not start a company to employ hundreds if not thousands of people like most traditional billionaires.  So no, they are not a net positive for the economy.This is astronomically stupid. A lottery winner pays taxes once.\n\nA billionaire who has made his money legitimately will have likely built a company that will pay taxes, generate employment, which also pays taxes, contribute to the gdp and actually provide a product that the market wants.This is by far the stupidest shower thought I've ever seen. It is entirely incorrect.I'm no economics guy, but the market's own inefficiency the big blockade in your theory? This is the factor that, I think, would consistently produce more GDP and strength if they made their own business out of grit and inspiration, as opposed to just spending on other businesses, a behavior I would predict much more commonly in a random gambling type.Traditional billionaires don\u2019t have liquid assets but they likely employee many thousands of people and contribute to the local and global economies. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not usually paying taxes on what they\u2019re worth.  \n\nLucky billionaires *might* give back to the community and spread the wealth amount friends and the less fortunate. They might even start businesses or establish grants.The winner of this last one will only net 600ish million if they take cash option, if they take the annuity, it will be 15+ years before they receive a billion in payouts. Nobody has ever been a lottery billionaire to date.Reminds me of the bit Dave Chappelle did when black people got reparations lol\n\n\nThat money is going straight back into circulation *very* soonThe world's newest billionaire might be lucky and pick up twitter at a fire sale in a month!Well, yeah, they actually put the money back into the cycle instead of hoarding it and going \"what? Inflation! How???\"Lottery winners will usually spend it all which is good for economy, but traditional billionaires also usually own businesses which is good for economy on a bigger scale and still pay taxes just not taxes on profit because they use tax law to 0 out profit. Often on expanding th3 business. The fact remains if your salary is 70k you generally cost your company about 80k b3cause they pay taxes on what they pay you (separate from the taxes the withhold for you).It\u2019s truly amazing we can raise almost 2 billion dollars in about 3 months but we can\u2019t get out of debt as a country\u2026? \ud83e\udee3This is an economically interesting idea. If there were some way to realistically test this it would be a great paperWell. They will pay taxes. And if they take annuity of the prize, most of the money will come from Treasury bonds. So yesThere have been 0 billionaires.\n\nOne option is to take the annuity worth 2b over time. If you dont take the annuity, you get around 1b. Then you get taxed around 400m and you end with around 600m...So TRUE! They create so many jobs and improve national GDP by a lot!!!!I genuinely cannot fathom how someone could win that sort of money and end up spending or losing it. I could genuinely live out the rest of my life on just the interest from that money, and live a very, very comfortable life, without ever even touching the original money. Just from putting it in bank, let alone investing it properly and getting a decent return on it. \n\nCase in point - let's say you win \u00a3500m. I'm in the UK and you can buy a decent little house for \u00a3180k, and let's say it's \u00a320k in costs to buy the house. You can buy 2,500 properties with that original amount. If you let them out for \u00a3800 a month, that's \u00a32m per month of income, and you still have the whole \u00a3500m still, just locked in to propertiesBut Reddit taught me that all billionaires are pure evil with waxy moustaches and swimming pools filled with gold coins!Depends, I suspect traditional billionaires create more jobs and opportunities than powerball billionaires, which is also good for the economy.Tradition billionaires create businesses that employ thousands, pay billions in taxes, and provide services/products people use.  \n\nGambling billionaires pay a one time tax on the income then redistribute earned money back to traditional billionaires.They'll buy things that make them happy.  Traditional billionaires will buy what will make them money.Spending isn't \"better\" for the economy, it is the outcome of saving & production. \n\nUnderstanding Say's Law would be a good starting point.Yes, the multitude of jobs and innovations some billionaires have certainly brought us worse for the economy than some lucky drawing\n\nGet real.We\u2019ll for starters, they\u2019re the only one paying their fair share to taxes.Powerball billionaires didn\u2019t give us Google, Apple, Amazon, and a million other goods and services that create jobs and benefit us on a daily basis. You\u2019re acting like traditional billionaires ended up with all that money for no reason.Why do they need to increase the jackpot by that much. Who seriously needs $1b? Separate it into chunks of $100m or even $50m and it will be even better for the economy. Even then, it's still too much for anyone or any family to have.Yeah but having people go on mad spending sprees just cause they can is not so good on the old sustainability front.Only if the central banks and governments are spending too little on stimulus during a downturn.\n\nFor the longer term, it is better for everyone when billionaires invest their funds to create more properties and businesses, rather than spend it.I bet. If I won I was planning on finding away to put at least half back into my community.  \n\nOne of the things I like fantasizing about most when thinking about winning the lotto(especially the big 500mil+ ones) is being able to put my money where my mouth it\u2019s. When thinking about the lotto I say to myself, I could live very comfortably off 15mil. I could set up a trust to help my family for another 10. \nYou cash option out this last powerball, I could double those numbers and still have nearly 950 million. To do shit with. That\u2019s a lot of paid med bills, scholarships, home repairs, surgeries, hospice care, funeral expenses. Fuck it\u2019s almost enough to give everyone in America $3. 950mil is a million per month for 79 years or $32,000 a day (if you just had it sitting in your safe at home earning no interest) When it\u2019s gone, what do I care? I have my nest egg and I can sleep easy knowing I helped a fuck ton of people. \n\nI 100% want to get my MacKenzie Scott on!Haha because they have no idea how to hold onto that money. Those billions end up circulating back into the economy rather than being used to seize more control.Wrong. Powerball billionaires don't use their money to buy newspapers and create private space companiesYep. All that money goes to cocaine dealers, which then goes back into the economy.Well, considering that winning a $2.04 BILLION prize only gets you $625 million, at least SOME billionaires are being properly taxed.Real talk, is the person who won the $2b even a billionaire after taxes and lump sum deductions?\n\nHow much of those $2b is he actually getting?Shit I would give so much to my family, my parents in particular. I would probably buy a house, a decent car, give some nice donations to local food banks and charities, and then probably invest whatever is left.Yea bc they put most of it back into the economy when they get it instead if saving it like actual billionares doYeah, if I had won the 2B powerball, I legitimately would\u2019ve given every teacher in our school district like $20k, just for being teachers and loving our kids. I\u2019d also set up trust funds for every kid in my family and all my friends kids for college so that\u2019d be taken care of. Then I\u2019d start creating scholarships.The winner won\u2019t be a billionaire after Uncle Sam gets his cut.Well ya, they go bankrupt in a few years. Most billionaires hoard their money, not spend it like a five year old.If I won several Million/ a couple billion dollars in the lottery, I definitely would crash my local economy and devalue the dollar because of how much and how quickly I spent a large portion of it.Powerball billionaires didn't create apple, Google, Amazon, or tesla. They produce nothing for society. Plus, they just spend the money they have immediately as opposed to regular billionaires who invest nearly all of itReal billionaires will us it to create more goods and services, which drive down prices and increase living standards.\nLotto winners just spend and increase inflation without producing anything. Which just gi es it to the real billionaires.I\u2019d be like when Ricky (trailer park boys) got 30k at once when he got out of jail... \u201cI\u2019m rich as fuck now so I\u2019m going to pay you a million dollars to fuck off\u201dLottery winners will spend the money, not stash it offshore, so miles betterI did read your whole speech and appreciated it. I pretty much agree with most of that to be my understanding as well. I was just trying to make it a little more concise so regular people can understand. And like you say, a guy winning the lottery will blow their money and it will be done and gone in a few years. And it will benefit the local economy from the spending. And a Billionaire's company might be around for 20 or 30 years employing all those people and hopefully growing along with the population. And they generally want to grow their Fortune more, which means the company will hire more. Until they need to fire to make the stockholders happy. Haha.\n\nHopefully somebody learns a bit from this. And I appreciate your input and hope the world ends up better all around.Such an r/antiwork perspective\n\nThese people probably aren't going to employ thousands of people, build innovative products that make our lives better, etc. Things that non-lottery billionaires do that do have postive economic impact.This completely tracks.\n\n One. Their texts are a lot easier to track since it's a single source of income.\n\n Two statistically 75% of lottery winners spend all of that money in 5 years.\n\n If that California resident blows through a billion dollars that's going to do a shit ton of stimulate the economy of wherever they spend it.Powerball billionaires didn\u2019t earn it and will likely blow it all quickly on crap that doesn\u2019t help the world or economy. \n\nTraditional billionaires created companies that produce and create real value in the world and economy.Not true. Traditional billionaires supply jobs and other such stimulationNo? Traditional billionaires own and run mega-businesses that employ thousands, and are the engine that keeps the economy going\n\nThey\u2019re awful for human rights, human decency, the environment, etc. but traditional billionaires are FAR better for the economy. The economy isn\u2019t literally as simple as \u201clotto winners spend their money\u201d lolI will never believe that lottery is any good for the economy. The only traditional billionaires I know are jeff bezos, bill gates, mcdonald's guy, walmart guy, etc. and they do a lot of good for the economy. I ain't about the sweatshop labour, but they're the main signs that your area has life and affordable things.Usually, a billion dollar business has to provide products and services that people use.  If the business doesn't provide to society, then it never becomes a billion-dollar business. \n\nI'm sure some lottery winners do use their money to provide things for society or for people.  But a lot don't.It's pretty much the opposite. \"Traditional\" billionaires got that way because they are really good at investing in things that turn out to be successful, really good at growing and managing businesses. What is a random person going to do with a billion dollars except spend millions on luxuries, and hand the rest over to a firm to manage for them.For the economy,  yes. It has been studied a few times and most spend it all within a few years. But going from mega rich to broke can't be good for your mental health.Lotteries and lottery winners basically generate zero anything for the economy. It's just taking other peoples' money which they used to buy worthless numbers on a piece of paper and spending it somewhere else. Not to mention that the idea of lottery and gambling can prey on impoverished families, reducing the chances that they will escape poverty, hurting the economy as well.This comment section is just a bunch of kids and people who don't even make six figures talking about what it would be like to have hundreds of Millions of dollars.\n\nJust like me, nobody here could imagine having a $100,000 let alone a hundred million or a billion dollars in their bank accountA \"billionaires\" company typically employs thousands and provides a place for most people in this country to have a reliable means of building wealth for retirement.  Say what you want, but if you look at the 5 wealthiest in the country people working at their companies make well over minimum wage.  \n\nRando who bought the scratcher, half to taxes, and most of the rest to sit in a wealth account earning them money.Depends on how the \"traditional\" billionaires made their money.  Many started companies, employ thousands of people (who also pay taxes), and create a product/service.  Lotto billionaires pay taxes once and that's it.Not really. Most regular billionairs employ thousands of people. Power ball winners tend to sit on their money or throw it away without doing anything to create more jobs.A billionaire builds a business that employs people and sells products consumers want.  The lottery takes money in exchange for a receipt.  \n\nA non-partisan study shows that Billionaires only retain 2.2% of the benefit from the businesses they create, the other 97.8% of the benefit is experienced by the rest of us.  A lottery billionaire would never do that.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working\\_papers/w10433/w10433.pdfAnd this is why economics should still be taught in high school...\n\nTraditional billionaires generally own companies. Companies that employ people and offer goods and/or services. Those goods and/or services are available for purchase by the general public. That's how economics works.Nah.\n\nA lot of bilionaires became bilionaires having patents or creating something useful that gets them a lot of money.\n\nThe idea of the billionaire that gained wealth by inheritance or by hoarding wealth is a myth in most cases.\n\n\n\nYou can argue that taxes should be higher for brackets of  wealthy people, but eliminate billionaires just doesn't work.Regular billionaires generally have create tens if not hundreds of thousands of jobs. that creates perhaps tens of billions of economic activity supporting thousands of other businesses creating more jobs. \n\nI doubt a powerball billionaire is going to create those many jobs and add that much economic value and prosperity to a country. \n\nCreation of new jobs has a lot lot more benefits to a country than paying taxes because of the circular economy effects. Paying taxes is definitely good but it\u2019s not as good as creating tons of new jobsI doubt it. Most people become terrible the second you give them even the tiniest perception of superiority. Imagine what the average person becomes when they're almost instantaneously above the law.Amazing how many people love to get robbed by the mafia because it helps \u201cinfrastructure\u201d[removed]Lottery winners almost always end up broke in a few years. At least that money isn\u2019t being horded.They\u2019re going to pay more taxes day one, then most billionaires pay in yearsThis is literally true. The concept of the \"velocity of money\" is strongly relevant here (pr\u00e9cis: money does stuff for economy when it moves, rich people getting richer bad for economy because they tend to slow it down and hoard it rather than spend it i.e. give a poor man $1,000 and he'll spend most of it improving his life which will be passed on to retail or people in the community whereas even a millionaire let alone a billionaire won't do anything with it), as is the tax implicationHard to say since money that goes into funding successful companies is more valuable than someone buying a lot of stuffPowerball winners might have billions of dollars but they are not a billionaires. It's based on their worth not how much money they have.They are definitely not... \n\nTake Elon Musk for instance, his companies SpaceX and Tesla both have more than 100.000 people employed. Moreover, they are creating even more jobs through sub-contracts and so on.\"traditional billionaires\" build the businesses that keep the economy afloat. They are the businesses the government taxes to fund everything they spend.Probably not. Considering most earned billionaires have created thousands upon thousands of jobs, productivity, development, pay more in taxes over a lifetime, and help grow the economy in general, a lottery billionaire is likely to not set up a will, die from hookers and blow and then give all the money back to the government.No one needs that much money. I DREAM of the good things I could do with it.lol what a dumb take considering a lot of billionaires have created their wealth through businesses that provide jobs. People are so damn delusional these days.Hookers and drugs definitely a much better trickle down effect vs ferraris and yachtsBecause they spend the money once? Rather than create jobs which provides salary to millions for years.......sure.A big part of my if-i-ever-won is giving a lot of it away. I don't need exorbitant amounts of money.Just wait until there are a bunch of apes that finally have money.I see you're thinking about the prize money.\n\nI guess I'm more concerned with the ticket sales it took to generate the prize. Multiple billions given to the government for them to squander away on programs handed to cronies.\n\nNot sure I agree with that picture being good for society or the economy.Until you consider all the people across the country that paid $2 for nothing. I feel like they have a negative effect that is more spread out.Invested capital is WAY more positive influence on society than wasted consumptive capitalIf I ever strike it rich, I'd invest the money in entities focused on improvise society. I'd start my own too. Pay some legal shmows to figure out a way to make sure that the company couldn't be operated in a way to make obscene profits to be paid out to investors or executives.Cocaine and hookers aren't taxed, so you're not really generating much revenue there.The dude who sold the ticket got a million and said he was donating to charities and giving some to his employees. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s Elon musk..Errr, no. Hard no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTypical billionaire that didn't inherit it (or won it) gained it by typically employing a vast amount of people. All the employees pay tax and spend money as they go along. As does the billionaire. If he wants a yacht, that'll be build and that effort alone will employ several hundreds of people, through the yacht life will employ people again (permanently and again keeps refit companies in business, which of course buys stuff from suppliers and so on).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother misconception is ''so and so billionaire made 2 billion in 2022, but he only paid 1% tax on it'' or such headlines. What almost always happens in such sitations, is the value of his companies have gone up, which he has shares in...but so long he doesn't sell his shares, he's made no profit on them. The monies he pays out as salary will be taxed, the monies he takes out as dividends will be taxed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe typical billionaire invests in his businesses and often angel invests in others, creating entire new economy platforms. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose that became a billionaire by winning the powerball, apart from the tax hit generally don't do all that much with the money, all things considered. Most leave their job (that's an obvious one), buy a few homes, a few cars, maybe a boat (not even superyachts that employ 10+ people directly, as that's simply out of the grasp for most powerball winners...!) and go on (foreign) holidays. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA powerball winners' typical idea of investment, if they even do it, is loan some of their friends some money so they can finally start that restaurant (which will fail 80% of the time after begging for more and more money and ending the friendship) or other, forgive me for being too blunt, small minded business (that is not to say I don't support the idea of a local business, quite the opposite in fact, I think it's great!), that'll hardly keep an economy going. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's easy to hate on billionaires but 99% of it comes from narrowmindedness and only looking at clickbait headlines.This is just so wrong. A big part of why inflation is happening now is because of the stimulus checks people got around the world during the pandemic. The more money someone suddenly gets, the worse off the economy is. The only thing that doesn\u2019t fuel inflation is tax cuts.It gives heroin addicted cousins something to strive for, ya know.I'd argue actually not, because most billionaires got there from investing and raising capital to invest in production, which creates perpetual returns and increases the stock of goods and services available to the economy.  A lotto winner might be 'good for the economy' if you think consumption spending is good for the economy, but the whole system is just a wealth transfer from mainly poor people, turned into tax (which at best is neutral for the economy, and often destructive with no means to measure its 'success', and very little real accountability), and consumption - not producing new goods and services.Depends\u2026 do they go out and burn it all up their nose? Will they just toss it into a savings account and live off interest? How many/which businesses will they invest in?Well I won four power mega jackpots and as I recall in 2001 I just decided to take a lump sum and buy apple and Amazon stock.  Then I hit my head and ended up in the hospital and have had amnesia every since.   So I forgot that I owned stock.Absolutely! \n\nFirst thing I would do is get purses and bonds for my whole family and friend-fam group.Investing your money well is much better for the economy than throwing it away on random shit.My mom was telling me about what she\u2019d do if she won it. She said she\u2019d give her immediate family a million each. Like me, my brother, my grandparents, my niece when she\u2019s older, her brother and maybe his kids. As well as to my dad\u2019s side of the family. She also wanted to pay off my grandparent\u2019s house and fix it up for them, and finally just to buy a nice house (not luxurious or mansion type).\n\nWhy did I say all this? Basically I agree that powerball billionaires are better then regular ones.If you want the technical term, it's \"marginal propensity to consume.\" In part, a lottery winner at this level, if they have friends and family, is likely to make several induvial millionaires, who will all buy property, vehicles, clothes, and services.\n\nYoung and poor people tend to have the highest MPC, so when a Republican stays we should stimulate the economy by giving tax breaks to the rich, they're full of shit. Giving the rich more money does not create jobs or demand.\n\nGive poor people money -- and they'll spend it on necessities first, and then on things like entertainment and services. All of the money goes right back into the economy, which creates more demand, which creates more demand.\n\nAnd so a smart government and populous would not have a problem eliminating student loan debt -- because those are the people with the highest MCP. More houses bought. More goods bought. More services needed. Everyone would benefit.\"Most lottery winner spend their fortunes within a few years\" and? That money is more often spent on local businesses and helps invigorate the local economy. Spending the money doesn't mean it disappears, it goes to other people who can now afford things for themselves. Billionaires invest their money in ways that screw over the rest of the economy, just look at how the banks caused the 08 recession (that will likely happen again). So yea, OP is correct.Traditional billionaires make their money by saving, saving money is inherently bad for the economy. Everything they do is in an attempt to make and save more money.100% since most lotto winners blow all their money fast.  That and the taxes reaped from getting it in a lump sum or the residuals from the longer payout go back into the local infrastructure.Seeing as lottery winnings are taxed at min 25%, yes they undoubtedly are.Well considering about 1.55 billion is instantly take back by the government, I guess so. Interesting that they can't seem to do that simple task with the rest of the billionaires.If I won my plan was to keep 20M for family and donate the rest.I hate how people act like billionaires are horrible people who cheat the system. In reality, they pay more taxes than any of you pay, maybe less in percentage but still more, and they provide hundreds of jobs.I second this. Congrats you SOB. Do good in life. That\u2019s my only advise. But darn, I wish I could share it.I understand, I get you.  There's been richer and poor people since the first caveman had one rock to his neighbor's too. \n\nIt really seems to come down to a subjective judgment of how we feel those people are spending their money. Mackenzie Scott anyone?Yeah! Just think of all of those jobs, businesses, and products that have been brought to market by all of those famous powerball winners. \n\nGee, who knew that everyone is just a powerball win away from making their own internet search platform, or smartphone, or new electric car company. \n\nSurely powerball winners are spurring the economy by buying a new car, house, and boat. Think of the 10s of jobs those purchases have sustained!Ahh\u2026 gotta love the increasingly common, economically illiterate opinion that spending is better for the economy than producing, saving, and investing\u2026There can\u2019t possibly be anything more incorrect anywhere on the internet, maybe EVER.I hope the best for them\u2026 why is everyone so filled with doubt?Ugh, this is what happens when economics isn't taught in high school.Total randos are not usually the best macroeconomic capital allocators.Rather the opposite. \n\nPowerball billionaires are likely to blow their money. They'll give it to scammers or strippers, make bad investments, and in general spend in a way that leads to less economic growth than if the money was just handed out evenly or something. \n\nBillionaires who earned their money got it by making people's lives better in some way or another, and presumably will use their capital management skills to continue doing so. Even if not, the money is saved and invested, making it available to those who wish to build or expand businesses.The level of economic illiteracy in this thread is mind blowing. How does a lottery winner add more value to the economy, than traditional billionaires who create organizations, with 1,000s of people, and quality products and services to become billionaires?If I won this PowerBall I would spend it all on the getting a citizenship elsewhere and gtfo of America. It's a sinking ship here.I'd say probably not. They give far less jobs than regular billionaires and they waste it so bad it usually just ends up with making a few people rich.\n\nOn this topic, for a country to have no billionaires, the money would have to go to other countries, which would of course negatively impact the economy, locally.no... its better for existing companies to make those profits not you.. there is a difference between producers and consumers... producers have provided this platform for you... consumers would have taken the capitol that made this possible and ran off with it...Traditional billionaires create hundreds of thousands of jobs. A single powerball winner is probabily going to waste his wealth in crap like yacht, small islands and vanity shit94k a day to spend 2b in 60 years.... that is not even considering the return on investing.  I would be amazing for the economy!Assuming consumption is better than investing.\n\nI doubt that is the case. Investing creates growth more than consuming. Traditional billionaires create a lot of jobs, growth, efficiency, increase supply for certain products (pushing down price for consumers)\n\nThen again, powerball billionaires will also likely invest, and maybe they'll trust proper financial advisors who somehow end up recommending better investments (for the economy) than traditional billionaires wouldPretty much the exact opposite.\n\nPowerball winners consume without producing. They are equal to trust fund kids and other recipients of unearned wealth.\n\nThe best people for our economy are hardworking misers with no heirs. They work hard to produce goods and services for the economy and demand nothing but a pieces of worthless paper or a number on a spreadsheet. Essentially, they work for society for free.powerball billionaires generally don't employ people. so not really.People just don't know how the world really works.... those self made billionaires have a ton of workers usually make a product which helps further the economy, so how does a lotto winner actually help again???With 2 billion they could afford to give every American a million dollars and still have 665 million left over!This is brain dead, Fortune 500 companies average 50,000 employees. And they don\u2019t last 3 years.What series of thoughts could have possibly produced this post other than typical reddit student politics sentiment?\n\n A billionaire with no means is a literal waste. You couldn\u2019t spend a billion dollars on personal purchases if you tried. The money is just sitting there. That\u2019s not good for the economy you dummies. I say for every million dollars in the pot you have one winner. 500 million jackpot? 500 winners. On drawing day they wouldn't pick random balls out but rather pick random winners based on the actual numbers on the tickets sold to everyone. This last 2 billion winner would instead be 2000 folks get a million dollars. Way better in my opinion.I think they're very similar. Both made all their money at the detriment of everyone else! Hahaha16.8K (90%) upvotes for something so monumentally stupid. Explains the less-than-stellar results against the Democrats in the election today.Absolutely False the exact oppositeis the case. Most normal billionaires wealth isn't liquid cash they are billionaires because they own capital in the form of businesses and factories and the \"means of production\" for producing all the real wealth and tangible assets that we actually consume.  The for example the Koch Brothers own refineries if you destroyed their wealth by blowing up their refineries we all would suffer because there would be less gasoline produced.  If you were to burn the cash of the lottery winner their would just be a little bit of deflation making everyone else's  money a little more valuable by increasing its purchasing power.[deleted]what a braindead take. who do you think \"hoards\" more wealth?\u201cPeople who\u2019ve never been able to accumulate this level of wealth on their own will be better at managing that wealth than those who have.\u201d\n\nMost idiotic, pretentious shit.This is incorrect.\n\nTraditional billionaires are much better for the economy because they are capitalists. Capitalists invest in capital goods - which are goods that create value - and thus their investments end up creating *more * value over time, as they create value generation engines.\n\nA lot of lottery winners just blow their money on conspicuous consumption and end up with nothing. Conspicuous consumption is the purchasing of expensive luxury goods and services, but unlike capital goods, these consumer goods don't continuously generate value, so the value goes down over time and eventually goes away entirely.Eh, which kind of \"traditional\" billionaire? A billionaire who built something that generated billions of dollars of wealth employs a lot of people through their businesses. That process is likely generative of wealth and class migration for at least some people. The inheritance kind of billionaire is closer to a lottery winner and my gut says they are consumptive but not generative of much wealth for other people.Its actually the opposite. Traditional billionaires have their money invested back into the economy, either through regular investments, charity, R&D, or other things.\n\nPowerball millionaires wouldnt be all that good at contributing to the health of the economy. They would just spend money on frivolous things and maybe sometimes donate (since they dont usually realize that donation can help on tax incentives)\n\ndisclaimer: This doesnt apply to everyone on both sides, but generally speaking, there is a reason traditional millionaires and billionaires tend to stay rich while those who newly acquired vast sums of money tend to lose it all pretty quickly\n\nFor an anecdotal evidence, my friend's uncle won like $20,000 in a lottery ticket and instead of using it to do some investing (he wasnt in any serious debt or anything, so he could've done it), but instead used it to put a down payment on a brand new truck. This is totally fine and its his money, but it might've been more wise to just invest it instead. But oh well lolno kind of billionaire is better for the economy than any other; they're all badAs they dump their billions back into the economy within a year?  TotallyMany people with no money pour money into a fund received by a few with zero financial savvy. I guess it depends on what you consider \"better for the economy\".That money is going to be spread far and wide, no doubt about that.\n\nI used to play Powerball when the jackpot would reach a certain threshold, but the more I thought about it, the more winning it sounded like a horror show. Apparently the first thing you're supposed to do when you win is lawyer up, because people will come out of the woodwork to sue you or otherwise lay claim to what you won. Though I've heard there are states where you can appoint an emissary to collect the winnings and remain anonymous. Doesn't work that way in my state: everybody will know your name and where you're from. Not if you follow that train of thought to future generationsAfter lump sum and taxes, not actually billionaires either.  Even your lottery system is a lie.Yeah, we're more creative. \n\nFirst, assuming I make away with roughly $1 billion out of the $2 billion, give or take a couple hundred million, I'm quitting my day job, buying my own place in Tahoe & I'm going to be attempting necromancy on the whole city of Detroit cause damn, that place needs help!If you won a million dollars I would strongly suggest investing your money. If you won a billion dollars, go crazy. Unless you are buying mansions, yahts, or jets you will never run outNaw dog rich people buy wasteful stuff that doesn't really help anybody and probably hurts us all in the long run. These powerball winners buy insane houses they can't afford in the long run which just end up as run down wastes with no value for anybody. The construction company might make a buck building and the gardener maintaining but that doesn't last forever.  Once the work dries up and the house isn't maintained it doesn't really do anybody any good. Broken window fallacy in a way isn't it?Someone in California is about to find out. Single winning ticket sold there. Back to work tomorrow to me.I was gonna buy a motorhome if I won and travel the country and pay school lunch debts, pay lay aways off,  buy peoples groceries and whatever else I could come up with.Well most billionaires never see a billion in cash like a Powerball winner, so they wouldn\u2019t owe nearly as many taxes to start.But don't billionaires usually employ lots of people. Which helps the economy lots. A billionaire from the Powerball just simply has money.I couldn't take that much money and not feel bad for those who have a lot less. I would put aside a few million and use the rest to start a charity that gave people free quality childcare.Whichever town that money's gone to is in for a good few years.Well, they're better for the hookers and blow economy. But lottery billionaires don't necessarily make good decisions.Spending money for the sake of spending money doesn\u2019t create economic growth. I think this is a bit of a misconception. \n\nIf I went around breaking windows and then hired people to fix it, that wouldn\u2019t create economic growth.Why ? They got the same money, but didn\u2019t create a business, or jobs, or technology innovations or anything to contribute to human progress along the way. They just bought a ticket. That isn\u2019t better by a long shot.Yeah. Powerball billionaires employ more people than Jeff Bezos!Sadly no one becomes a billionaire through the lottery. Even the most recent one I think the math works out to you taking only like 600 mil if you take the cash option. Not to say that\u2019s not a lot but even just taking the cash puts you below and then you end up paying another like 40 % in taxYeah usually they didn't have to take advantage of untold amounts of people to win a random drawingThe gamer in me wants them to fund some independent studio projects. If I got hundreds of millions, I'd go ask Gaben if they had passed up anything recently with potential.It really is amazing to me how many people think that traditional billionaires just have billions of dollars sitting around in a savings account. I can't say for sure, but I would bet that anybody who wins a $5 Million Lottery, has more money in the bank than most billionaires. The companys that they own have all the money sitting in the accounts. Not the actual people. And that's why they don't pay that much in taxes. Because they borrow everything that their company owns. The mansions, the cars, the yachts, the planes, the expense accounts.\n\nThey don't want their money sitting in savings accounts like most people in the world. They want their money to earn more money.Not sure that just blowing your money on consumer goods is better than job creation for the economy, which would tend to be the difference between a lottery winner versus someone else.This is a great wealth transfer provided the winner manages it well.Traditional billionaires probably run large companies with multiple employees. I think they will be much better for the economy.That money should be top prize of 10 million and make hundreds of multi millionaires I\u2019d prefer more wealthy than one billionaireDude that's coin toss odds at best. \n\nIf your craziest thanksgiving wrecking uncle got 1B cash after taxes, you mean to tell me it would t me that bad?This vision that people keep talking about in this thread of billionaires who keep gold vaults where all their money is\u2026 beyond childish.\n\nIf you believe billionaires are what they are because of swimming pools full of cash \u201cnot going into the economy\u201d you have been brainwashed.\n\nI\u2019m not defending billionaires, but criticize them with an accurate understanding of what they are.So what's the best choice? Keep like 100k in savings, continue working or going to school for a few years while everything else sits in investments and a swiss bank account with a solid financial advisor to help massage the rest of it?Are they really billionaire if they only get 600m out of 2 bRandom question, but I heard that you should get the lump sum because they\u2019re not required to pay you after 20 years, is that true?In law school, an astonishingly high number of cases in my bankruptcy class involved lottery winners.Someone who spends most of their wealth is generally better for the economy than someone who hoards it.Im sure this has been said but there are not powerball billionaires (this includes the latest winner who I hope hires a lawyer and  anonymously claims the prize). Even the current winner would get around 500 million after taxes if taking the lump sum.\nAll be it still more than anyone ever needs but that isn\u2019t the point.\nPlus most winners aren\u2019t financially literate enough to invest the funds so the screw themselves and their generational heirs out of their fortune. So yes you are 100% right that lotto winners are better for the economy than billionaires but you are wrong about them actually being billionairesYeah, they typically are poor with money and will piss it all away in a handful of years.  It goes right back into the economy.  Fr tho, am I the only one that would invest a good chunk of it so I'd never have to work a day in my life again?  Just buy a plot of land out in the boonies and live my best life away from people.they don\u2019t run for office or think they actually have something to teach us allI don't even want to be a billionaire. I just want to pay off my debt.How could you not just constantly go around helping people for the rest of your life? It would be like being anointed a financial superhero! With great power comes great responsibility!Regular billionaires have probably paid out millions of hours of employment to get where they are, probably ultimate pumping far more than they have back into the economy.\nLotto winners spent a few bucks at the gas station.How many jobs will a powerball billionaire create vs the millions of careers that have been created by \"traditional billionaires\". Microsoft, for example, will pay out more to employees this quarter than all the powerball winners will everThey're new poor. We're old poor.Literallly [this comment](https://reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/ypzw23/powerball_billionaires_are_probably_way_better/ivmacoe)I don't know how finances work...\u201cI don\u2019t know how a self-sustaining economy works.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how *our* economy works.\u201dWhich is great because the economy is in shamblesTo build a self sustaining economy, you have to make sure the money keeps moving...in a circle.Imagine spending a billion in 5 yearsif part of that is on a house, it's not a total loss thoughCan confirm. I won $10 last week. Already spent 40%.I feel like this statistic, while probably true, is a bit misleading. Often multiple people win the same lottery and it is split between them. My mother had the winning numbers in the Florida lottery back in the 90s and got around 3k or so because it had to be shared. Not to mention the massive chunk that is taken by the government. We got to go to Disney World though!\n\nTrying to blow through 2 billion dollars within 5 years (without buying an island or donating to charity, for example) would be difficult, I think. A real \"Brewsters Millions\" situation. I'm sure it can be done but only with completely ridiculous purchases.Good. \n\nThe whole thing point of money is to spend it to better your life and participate in the economy. Hoarding and sitting on the initial winnings is not the point. \n\nLet's say I am won the lottery - if I immediately bought a house, an investment property, stocks, paid off my debts, purchased an Aged Care Plan and prepaid funeral plans for myself and my immediate family, I could easily spend all of my winnings in a few years. \n\nBut have I \"wasted\" my money? Obviously not, I'm debt free and have investments that have the potential to provide me with longer term financial support, I'm in a much better position than I was before I won the lottery.\n\nI'm not living in poverty like I was before, I'm in a stable place, but I have spent all of my winnings.No shot u can spend 990mil in 5 years right?I think there was a TIL or some other reddit post saying this was a myth.Because 99% of lottery winners are getting less than $100,000. Only ONE other time has the lottery hit 1 billion and it was split by 3 people.> 70% of lottery winners spend all of their winnings in 5 years or less\n\nSo we could flood the economy if we just held powerballs for each Billionaire. \n\"Win Musk's Money, buy your Musk lotto ticket today!\"MythThis is an old wives tale with nothing to back it up100% of lottery winners spend 70% of their winnings on taxesThat is great for the economyNo amount of money automatically gives you the knowledge on how to spend wiselyI mean there's a difference between trickle down and blow through it all within 5 years.No, it was about not killing yourself with heroin and casinos. \n\nI'd rather my money not move into MGMs pocketI mean u really want billionaires out there without at least a lawyer and accountant?uhh do you not understand how other billionaires accumulate their wealth? this has nothing to do with ~~trickle down~~ horse and sparrow economicsIf the jackpot had topped $2B they would have been billionaires for a short period time.Well most billionaires don't \"earn\" a billion dollars in a single year.  Usually they either inherited most of it (so taxed on estate maybe) or they own a company or other property that is valued highly.  But if they don't sell any shares or property in a particular year there's no taxable event, at least in most countries.The government can't tax real billionaires the same they can with other people because real billionaires have the money and connections to avoid almost all taxation.It\u2019s because lottery winners get taxed like it\u2019s income whereas billionaires don\u2019t have their wealth in liquid. It\u2019s all tied up in assets instead, which can\u2019t be taxed like income because it\u2019s not income. Also, up here in Canada we don\u2019t tax lottery winnings. You get to keep 100% of what you win through any sort of gambling, whether it\u2019s at the casino, lottery, or whateverInteresting, in my country lottery winnings are tax free so I tend to assume you get what's on the tin.\n\n This was for like two billion though. Would you actually get taxed more than fifty percent of these winnings?You say that like I wouldn't be happy finding a crisp 20 on the sidewalkThe pot was for 1.9billion and if you took the lump sum you got around 930million. If you do the payments I believe you got over a billion. But yes expect to loose 50percent of your winningsMore importantly: they actually pay their taxes. If the typical billionaire paid what they should, a lot more of them would be multimillionaires too.Both \"billion\" dollar power ball winners took home over 900 million. 900 million at 2% interest is 18 million. It wouldn't take them long to be billionaires unless they go out spending tens of millions each month.If you win a billion in Powerball it ends up being like 456, million, so while yes you're technically a multimillionaire the word doesn't really do it justice.\n\nProperly utilized, you're in a much better position to be a proper billionaire, since people who got their hundreds of millions the traditional way don't have the money liquid.Demibillionaires at leastFrom a Canadian perspective that kinda sucks. We don't get taxed on lottery winnings here.\n\nAlthough our jackpots don't get anywhere near that high. It's capped at $70m jackpot for our largest lottery.With 5% interest they'd be billionaires within a few years.Yeah it's insane how much is cut out, they still get just shy of a billion. Next time we need a 2.1b pot just to make sure we collectively make a random person a billionaire after big brother takes their cut.Also, lotto winnings just redistribute wealth from many poor people into the hands of a few poor people.  I wouldn't say it helps the economy at all.Imagine a grown adult saying thank you for upvotes\u2026goodness that\u2019s tragicThis is the way.  Every billionaire should be a multi-millionaireWhat do you have against Miami hookers> Train your children or someone else worthy to take over when you die\n\nTherein lies the problem. Even if you do train your children, someone, somewhere down the line is going to birth a shithead who is going to take it all and burn it to the ground for no good reason at all.>Train your children or someone else worthy to take over when you die.\n\nLol easier said than done. It's probably the hardest thing to do in this list, including winning the lottery in the first place.This is a good plan, but I'm going to offer a different one. \n\nLet's say, you win $150m after taxes\n\nStep 1. Blow *at least* 50m on a giant fucking house. Pay the whole fucking thing off, and prepay utility companies for the next 60 years. Make sure it has a big fenced property attached.\n\nStep 2. Blow *at least* 10m on cars, clothes, and shit to fill your house. Dress like a cowboy just cause. Be eccentric as fuck. \n\nStep 3. Blow *at least* 5m on... blow. So much of it. Make it snow for your buddies. \n\nStep 4. You still have so much fucking money left, so adopt like, a bazillion dogs and set aside enough money to care for them and hire people to care for them and love them and play with them. Pay them a good salary with lots of vacation all the way until the money is gone. \n\nStep 5. Die penniless knowing you lived a kick ass life and helped a bunch of dogs, and let a bunch of people live the dream of playing with dogs for a living.If you put 50 mill into dividend stocks you\u2019re getting back about 2.5 million a year passively \ud83e\udd75> Ever hit one of these huge lotteries where you'll have hundreds of millions after taxes.

Charities are not efficient tax avoidance schemes.If you\u2019re only giving the investment earning to charity, there\u2019s no difference between keeping the money and giving it to the charity really. Most billionaires commit to give away their actual money to charity, not just the investment earnings to charity. This would be significantly less generous than how Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, etc.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_PledgeUntil one of those Managing it commits fraud and embezzled or something.... it's inevitable... greed.....Government and their grubby hands, although an inefficient system, does pay for things like hospitals and schoolsHi, my name is MoneyRight which means all the money they won is going back into the economy!> Actually there is no way. Billionaires like Bill Gates Tim Cook Mark Cuban and virtually every one of them became billionaires by creating companies that hire thousands upon thousands of people. Many of these people can afford to live or have good careers based on that.\n\nThose fuckers!what behavior is praised for rich people but stigmatized for poor people ? Hoarding.Rich people do not hoard money, that would be insane. All their money is invested in and circulating around the economySo if my business does well and it's value gets high enough....I have a mental illness. Then next year my business tabks and loses its value....I'm no longer mentally ill. Mmkay.JFC, talk about sour grapes. Being rich is not a mental illness.No. Billionaires have all their money invested in companies. Building a factory isn\u2019t hoarding the money that was used to build the factory. The money is being spent in useful ways.What? How is wanting to keep your money for future generations a mental illness?How is hoarding if it's all tied up in shares, real estate, etc?There is no such thing as \u201choarding\u201d money. Given a dollar, you can either spend it or invest it. There is no third option. Even if you keep it in cash, you are effectively investing in dollars \u2014 poor returns but great liquidity.Rich people don\u2019t hoard their money, they invest it. It\u2019s actually basically impossible for them to hoard it, unless they literally have it buried somewhere. Banks invest rich people\u2019s money for them. Rich people put money to work in private equity. Investment is the reason every single company you use on a daily basis existsWho\u2019s hoarding money? You mean cash? Money in the bank is just reloaned into the economy.Billionaires companies are worth billions but they don't have a billion sitting in the bank.\n\nHow is it a mental illness to have a shit load of money \ud83d\ude02Not really do you hoard your money?No it's not lmao.

Straight into bonds or term deposits.I think the important distinction is that they are more likely to just spend their money because most lottery winners are terrible with money and many end up using it up staggeringly fast.\n\nBillionaire CEOs often hoard wealth which does nothing good for the economy. Just ensures the rich/poor divide remains in place.It\u2019s embarrassing how much scrolling was necessary to find this first & only reasonable response to OP. Thank you for shedding some much needed light on this ridiculous comment section.It is an incredibly dumb shower thought because it puts all billionaires in a binary position; they're either better or worse for the economy than lottery winners.\n\nStrawman Billionaire One might be a positive but Strawman Billionaire Two might be a drain.This.That's not outrage clickbait. And it's the trickle down thing people don't want to face is trueMost lottery winners blow it all any how, most lottery money is just funneled directly back into the economy pretty quickly.I dont work too far from there. I wonder if I know the winner..You just accounted for $10 to $15 million. You have $985 million left. Now what?But then the purple haired ladies on my uncles Facebook page would still be complaining about how SS isn\u2019t keeping up with inflation (until it was, and now a compromise student loan forgiveness is off the table)I\u2019m gonna build a pyramid, but upside down, shows those stupid Egyptians who\u2019s boss.[deleted]No, its actually better for the economy to have people buying frivolous things than to have a bunch of wealth hoarders. When they go to a nightclub and buy champaign for the everyone and drive away in their Italian sports car a lot of stuff has been bought and it creates activity for the whole supply chain. What you call \"investing\" is really just the billionaires putting the money into mutual funds and walking away from it. That doesn't really stimulate the economy that much. \n\nIt might be better for an individual to pace yourself and let the money last, but for the health of the economy, you want that money spent as fast as possible. Part of it is the multiplier effect where you stimulate the whole supply chain with every purchase.I did a lot of day dreaming for a few days \ud83e\udd7a lucky bastard in California, all I wanted was to quit my job and afford to live on my own is that too much to ask for \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I'm tired of people touching my stuff, cleaning up after adults and having my space invadedThe economy is stimulated by money flow.  Billionaires are notorious for paying minimum wages to their employees, and just sitting on the majority of their fortune while it collects them more money in non liquid fashion.\n\nLottery winners are known to blow their money on dumb shit.  But that dumb shit stimulates the economy.  They blow it fast, and that's high flow.Turn it all in to gold build a big vualt in your basment occasionally go for swims in it.I absolutely would do so. As anonymously as I could. I don't think I would personally ever need more then 15 or 20 million dollars. I certainly could use it and dream of ways to spend it but it isn't \"needed\". You can literally better the outcome of peoples lives with that money.The Onion has a very informative video on this very topic!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/05RZJxDIhTUI believe in The Great Gatsby that\u2019s East Egg and West EggYou carry a harpoonI bet the billion is on a Dave and busters cardExactly this.\n\nAnd it makes perfect sense to me that people would have poor understanding of this... After all, it is a thread about people interested in the lotto.\n\nAnd the lottery is a tax for people who suck at math.Lmao that's the best line I love DennisYou mean Zuckerberg with meta?IIRC the person who won the $2.04 billion will walk home with about 30% of that if they take the lump sum payment.  The lottery wants to pay it out as an annuity over 20 years so if you take a lump sum they calculate the loss due to inflation and take that off the top (which is a lot).\n\nThen the IRS steps in and taxes you at the maximum rate and there is really no way around that.\n\nSo, the winner will walk home with around $615 million.\n\nDon't get me wrong...that's an incredible amount of money.  That is \"fuck you\" money (as in you are rich enough to tell anyone in the world to fuck off and not care).  But it is not the billions he supposedly won either.Imagine spending $44B on a bluffIf you sleep for 8 hours a day,\n5 years x 365 days x 16 waking hours = 29,200 hours\n\n1 billion dollars / 29,200 hours is about 34,000 dollars per hour, or basically a brand new car every hour.Well ain't nobody getting a billion. Even the person who just won 2 billion plus isn't getting a billionCheck out this [documentary starring Richard Pryor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088850).If you were really dedicated, and could spend $20 per second, you could spend $1 billion dollars in 578 days.Give me the opportunity and stand back.\n\nJust watch.Gods I wish.It's actually super easy. \n\n1,000,000,000 \u00f7 5 = 200,000,000\n\n200,000,000 \u00f7 365 = 547,945.20/day\n\nBrand new 2022 Lamborghini Aventador = 546,847\n\nYou just gotta buy a brand new Lamborghini Aventador every single day for 5 years straight.

Build a wall around my property. Pay for security. And once that\u2019s all done I\u2019m saving the rest/investing/donating to charities and people directly.\n\nOoo and I could even hire locals to man the farm\nAnd pay a livable wage.

That would be an amazing feeling. It\u2019d be totally doable with that kind of money and a small crewIf you spend over 10 million on a house you\u2019re most likely going to lose money on it down the road.What do you plan to do with the remaining $4I'm thinking the same. I once tried to find the source of that urban legend, but everything seemed to either have no source at all or just made a circle (1 referred to 2 referred to 3 referred to 1).\n\nThe closest I found was a study in the UK (I think) that said, statistically, it was actually the opposite. Jackpot winners (the group they focused on) did fine. Mostly because so many realized they didn't understand \"big money\" & hired an advisor immediately.Even an Island doesn\u2019t cost billions, believe it or not.\n\nSource: close friend owns one in the Bahamas.Well step 1 is the government shows up and takes at least half, so closer to 1 billion.\n\nAnd then you're still basically a middle school math problem about how fucking hard it would be to lose all of that.\n\nShitty investing (and that includes the worlds dumbest drug habit/escort habit) would be the fastest/most likely way.  A divorce sets you back a nice 500 million likely, and that's getting closer to \"oh wait i shoudln't have bought that 8th jet\" territory.Would have to try that hard.

People get this kind of money and start to do stupid shit like driving a new car every day or buying pure gold collectible items.i think it really depends on your age. im in my 30's now and if i won i would plan on moving to somewhere nice but a bit secluded. maybe buy an electric car and all the stuff that comes with that, and just coast so i dont have to work. in my late teens-20's you bet your ass i would have got a mansion and at least 3 supercars.If you took the annuity option with 30 annual payments. That comes out to about $91,000 every 12 hours for 30 years. That\u2019s a decent yearly income\u2026. Every 12 hours! $7,610/per hour, 24/7, for 30 years non stop. It would be very hard to blow $2B.This.this mindset is exactly why over 60% of americans making six figures live paycheck to paycheck. it\u2019s not about hoarding money, it\u2019s about being smart with it. the lottery winners who \u201cparticipate\u201d all their money into the economy at the end of the day are the biggest losers.Put me in coachReminds of the 70s or 80s movie about the guy who inherits $1milion but has to spend it all in a week... I think it was called 'the bus that couldn't slow down'You could spend 50k a day for 5 years straight and not even get through 10% of the 990mil.You underestimate the amount of choc chip cookies I can buy my dude[deleted]True, but with a billion dollars you can afford a good accountant.You should spend around 4 million a week if you wanted to spend a billion in 5 years.Its probably nearly impossible to become poor in your lifetime with 2 billions.That\u2019s actually a myth about lottery winners. They almost always come out with a way better life and don\u2019t blow through even a fraction of what they received.More of a torrential downpourBest 6 months a person can ask for, followed by an unbelievable reality of the rest of their life.It made it to $2.04 billion with a 997.6 million dollar cash payment.That's what we call a Russ HannemanOh, stop. You are speaking with logic and sense instead of emotion. This is Reddit, where that is not allowed!I mean, yes, but no.\n\nA big part of it is the way billionaires make money. The billions aren't coming from salary, which is where the heaviest of taxes come in.\n\n*Portfolio Income*, like your stock portfolio increasing in value or dividends from stocks, allow the super wealthy to access things zero interest loans for millions of dollars (taking a loan against the value of your portfolio,) but this isn't where billionaires really make their money.\n\n*Passive Income*, in a technical sense, is money that comes in from renting out properties and \"income from a business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate.\"\n\nSo if you bought into a business as silent partner, you own part of the business but have no say in how it's run, your income from that business is passive.\n\nNow, technically passive income is taxed like salary, buuuuut if you were to loan that business money and then charge interest on that loan you could deduct the interest from those taxes.\n\nIf you happen to own a business or two that operates at a loss, you can also deduct *those* losses from your taxes as well.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nA big part of the issue of billionaires not being taxed is reforming the types of taxes the common person is used to (already an uphill battle,) won't affect the way billionaires make money.You mean they have lawyers and lobbyist. Because most of their worth is in stocks. Which gets tax by capital gains.I heard the last winner got taxed a ton. If you think about it, it\u2019s the IRS that won the Powerball \ud83d\ude022.04 billion  over 30 years or 997 million today.\nThen half tax so like 500 mil.Taxes are somewhere between 40% and 50% depending on the state.You take home like 600M.I saw a thing today that said the $2.06 billion cash payout was ~$994 million.. I\u2019d still take it, but ffs the IRS is making more than the winner! They didn\u2019t even buy a ticket!!!!I'd take a crumbled up one tooIf you took the lump sum, paid your taxes, gave yourself a $5M annual allowance, and put the rest in an index fund (let's say it returns 8% annually, on average), you'd have regained the initial tax hit by Year 9, have hit the total annuity figure by Year 19, and have a cool $4.7 billion by the end of what would have been the annuity period.Haha yeah. The tricky thing is that many billionaires\u2019 wealth is held in stocks, so they technically don\u2019t need to pay until they sell. Our system is kinda weirdIf you have 456 million in liquid capital you have to be a *colossal* moron to not have that be a billion in rather short order. Compounding interest gets crazy when you have a lot of money.I prefer the less specific term \"fractional billionaire\". I'm in that group. I have nearly $3 in couch-cushion moneySome people use the term centimillionaire for people who have between $100 million and $999 million.Warren Buffet once said something to the effect of \"Turning $10 into $100 is hard.

Success will not be tolerated around hereYeah people forget that this money is actually USED for things. It\u2019s INVESTED, not shoved in a fuckin mattress.You are right, it's wealth and power hoarding. However, I know nothing about the mental illness side of it.I think it's more about exploiting people for that money which I would argue is a morality issue not a mental health issue.You may laugh (or not see it) but I think the best visual example of this is in the (live action) Hobbit.\n\nA/w, there IS a certain point where you're no longer securing anyone's financial future, you're withholding someone else's. \n\nMoney in a bank is not just some stagnant thing.

They tend to be tied up in assets, stocks, and investment funds right? I assume that isn't the same kind of blackhole as it would be if someone just had it all in one giant ass vault to swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck.\n\nAlso I don't know if MOST lottery winners are that terrible with money. There definitely have been a number of cautionary tale instances where someone wins a big enough figure that it feels like unlimited money to them and they go off the rails with their spending. Then they end up blowing through fifty million in a year or two, find they have no money left, and have now developed a drug and gambling addiction while alienating all their friends and family. Then they tell the media how winning the lottery ruined their life.\n\nI have heard actually what's really common is for people to mainly sit on their winnings and not change their lifestyle overly much. They use it to pay off their mortgage and other debt and also do so for close family members and then not much else. They keep working at their job, they wear the same clothes and drive the same car, because that's what feels normal to them and they don't feel a strong desire to drive a Ferrari or live in a giant mansion.This is a common misconception.  Spending money is only better than saving for the economy if there's a shortfall in aggregate demand OR if we're above the golden rule savings rate.\n\nWe're below the golden rule savings rate, and not currently in an AD shortfall.  Therefore \"hoarding\" money is better for the economy than spending it.  \n\nIn other words, \"hoarded\" money is invested in capital, education, R&D, and other things that yield future benefit.  So long as we don't need Keynesian stimulus and so long as we're not already saving so much that it does excessive harm to current consumption, it's a positive.>I think the important distinction is that they are more likely to just spend their money because most lottery winners are terrible with money and many end up using it up staggeringly fast.  \n>  \n>Billionaire CEOs often hoard wealth which does nothing good for the economy.

Reddit aconomics is frightening.\n\nSpending money once (blowing it) is not as valuable as regenerating it.Personally i would give multiple millions yearly to organizations like St Jude, children's miracle network, doctors without borders....things like that. Also randomly pay for peoples stuff. Give huge tips to restaurant staff and hotel staff. Still wouldn't be able to spend it. \n\n  It is really too much money for one person. You could live beyond comfortably on 200,000 to 250,000 per year. But tens of millions per year for multiple decades? Its more then anyone conceivable needs.Oh! You just got squeezed out, bitch!I do math all day for a living and I play the lotto. I work in an office full of math people who play the lotto.  It's a couple bucks for a ticket that gives a ton of entertainment talking about what we'd do with the money. It's an insane amount of entertainment for $2.\n\nNow, the people that spend half their paycheck on it, that I will agree with you. Idiot tax if you buy more than a few tickets.Meh, I feel my chances of getting several hundred million dollars in my lifetime are about the same, whether it's the lottery or through other means.Lottery can be exciting i guess.

They just see this one big win and don't consider all the other times people win 1 million here 10 million there, etc. \n\nSo, there is this story always circulated on reddit how it is a curse to win the lottery because they will kill you and all that and give like 5 examples of shit happening to lottery winners. But completely ignore the fact that there are thousands of people that have won millions in the lottery and just faded into the background with no issue.A lot of the figures are made up, but some are real.\n\nThere was a study done in Florida on lottery winners who were financially distressed at the time that they won the lottery. One of the findings was that bankruptcy odds did not go down in the long run after winning money - it would temporarily decrease the odds, but the odds went back up after 3-5 years - though the lotteries in question were relatively small scale ($50k to $150k).\n\nhttps://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/93/3/961/57969/The-Ticket-to-Easy-Street-The-Financial?redirectedFrom=fulltextThere was just a TIL about this being a myth in the past day or so.

THEN the govt takes their share.Just buy out first class on a nice commercial jet, although they probably won't let you have a party with your 12 escorts. \n\nYeah on second thought a private jet is required.No, my mom only got 3k and we spent that within 5 years, lol.Less taxes.

After it would come out to around $538M. So like a quarter of the listed amount. In order to get the full $2B you'd have to agree to a 30 year annuity which would increase in payout amount by 5% each year. \n\nWhat's really funny is if you just took the lump sum, even after taxes, and invested most of it instead of just spending it all you could make more in total than the $2B annuity over those same 30 years. And you could still use multiple millions of it right awayThrow 90% of that bad boy into the S&P and wait a few years while you party with 100m and you'll be a billionaire.Still only *dos comas.*It\u2019s all good bro.

Printing money is simple when you already have it.You can\u2019t deduct interest from money you lent a business. That would qualify as income for you. \n\nWhat you probably meant is that they take a loan on stocks etc and use that as income and then sell only small amounts to pay off the interest thus allowing their investments to grow while maintaining their lifestyle without the huge upfront tax payments.\n\nOf course this will eventually catch up to them as the interest payments rise or upon death and they will be taxed considerably at that point.\n\nAlso you can\u2019t deduct business losses against personal income, only against future business profit if the business ever turns around.And accountantsIs there an echo?That's...what they said?\n\nWhat did you think this meant? \n\n>billionaires have the money and connections to avoid almost all taxation.And they win every time lolThe IRS just collects it, it doesn\u2019t get to keep it. The big winner (as always) is the US military industrial complex.Oh no, I only have almost a billion dollars. However will I survive?37% to federal, about half the states have zero state tax on winnings, the rest vary between 5-8% on average, some counties might have another 1-2% as well.Off of a 2 billion win? That shit could be taxed 90% and he'd still be wealthy enough to live off of it for the rest of his life with even the safest and lowest dividends investment.I think he got taxed way more because he opted to cash it all out at once as opposed to getting it in installments. Not 100% sure thoughOh you lost money in the stock market, that sucks. Oh you made money in the stock market? I think you mean \"we\" made money in the stock market.Even if you get taxed 90%, that's still 200mil.\n\nWhat the absolutely fuck crack are you smoking that 200mil is not a win?Which is good for all of us.Everyone always says the lump sum, despite taxes, is better...but damn, more than 5.5 million a month for the first option seems totally insane. I'm in my twenties, I can make it work. Budgeting for 5.5M a month seems easy.This makes me wonder if you can move to a state with no income tax to claim the jackpot. That could be a 9 figure amount for the winner of the $1.9B Powerball.Top Fed tax is 37% plus your state tax around 6% so about 43% of the \"lump sum\" goes to taxes, so they keep about 57% of it. So from a \"$2 billion\" prize they'll keep about $550 million. Which is a shit tom but a far cry from 2 billion.When it was 1.9 billion the take home was 925 millionThat\u2019s not the tax. The jackpot number is how much you get after 30 years of payments if you take the annuity. The cash option is the actual cash they have on hand. If you take the annuity option, they use the cash to purchase an annuity and after 30 years you get the full amount minus taxes. \n\nSo if you take the cash option you get the 994 million minus taxes. That\u2019s $626 million after federal taxes, less if you have state taxes. Federal tax rate is 37%It would be interesting to see the spending habits of all lottery winners who got over a certain amount, like $100m adjusted for inflation.  I don't want to stereotype but I have a feeling it's the kind of people who have no idea about the strategy you outlined.  My guess is best case they end up with a financial advisor that sets them in a similar direction not counting at least 1% lost from their fees or managed funds they talked them into investing.  And I bet they spent a chunk on dumb stuff and/or took a bigger annual allowance.When I started investing, the expected annual return of index fund was always 5% in discussions. It rose to 7% quickly, and now we're apparently talking about 8% returns. \n\nMaybe the highness of expected return in internet discussion could be used as recession predictor? Because 8% is ludicrous.\n\nNote: this isn't about the actual returns, just how much people expect the funds to return.The point of the post is hopefully they'll spend it and help normal people. Acting like a dragon hoarding the villager's gold should be much more shameful in the society we've created.Gets weirder. Typically to keep those future losses as theoretically minimal as possible but still have spending money, they take out massive loans at sweetheart rates. Kinda want the Fed to keep raising the rates.Or land, or private businesses, or any other asset really. Investments don\u2019t usually get taxed unless you sell them or if they generate ordinary income.These are people who play the lottery though$3? somebody's going out tonightWell you know how the people of Pacudah are driving a hard bargain.That's why you don't spoil them and make them work for their money at early age. I used to work at Burger King when i was a teen and there was this kid who came from a very wealthy family. He told us his father sent him to work a low income job even if he didn't need to in order to understand the value of work and money.But fuck the government right?! I'm only screwing politicians by not paying my taxes!His logic does seem to imply that \u2018as long as it\u2019s properly managed, my family for generations is set\u2019.\n\nTwo flaws - it likely takes more to remain tax exempt than he thinks.  \n\nHe\u2019s also not accounting for inherent greed.  I am dead certain that organization dies out within two generations after the founder passes.  It\u2019ll survive as his vision while he\u2019s alive.  But after that greed will see embezzlement.\n\nMakes me think of the couple in Bettendorf, IA.  They won, opened a grocery store in town cause there wasn\u2019t one.  Is decent sized, always has necessities, and has a cafe/deli that serves damn good breaded pork tenderloin sandwiches.  (They\u2019re thicker than most and always juicy).  They\u2019re selling it to fareway soon.  It\u2019ll lose that soul it has as a family owned business, and the cafe/deli is going away.But they're also donating to other charities, which yeah some are way better than others. So yeah true ..Mmmm gumjobs.The assumption is that the winner blows the money and spends most of it rather than letting it sit around gathering dust.Google \u201cVelocity of Money\u201d. \n\nA lottery winner will increase the velocity of money.Coke bingesLiving in a dumpster and fighting the cops while binging on heroine.... so hot right now.Nevermind the million of jobs\u2026 or the value it gives to peoples currency\u2026 the technological advances\u2026 quality of life improvements.  \nNo, we must to back to trading carrots for potatoes like the good ol times! No such thing as entrepeneuring!Probably sociopathic to exploit workers to acquire such wealth, lobbying to corrupt the democratic process.It's not wealth hoarding.  Their having stock value in their company does not mean they have taken the same value from others.  The economy is not a pie.Wealth is not a zero sum game.Even if you put money in a savings account it's fairly active in the economy as it's part of the same reserves as anything else.. it's actually pretty hard to remove money from the economy.  Even if you buy gold and bury it in the back yard you still put that amount of currency in the hands of whoever you bought the gold from... It's pretty tough.  I guess withdrawing it in cash and destroying it is the most deflationary thing I can think of.Blowing the money isn't as good for the person, but it is better the economy as it means that money is being cycled into the economy rather than sitting gathering cyber dust in a bank account. The vast majority of billionaires money will never actually be used, it'll be passed down to their kids who will pass it down etc etc until something happens to make the money lose its value or something. Blown money will be spread around to people with less money who will in turn use the money and keep it cycling.\n\nEdit: because people have a habit of hanging onto words literally, when I said bank account I didn't mean they literally hold their cash in a liquid state in a bank account. I used the term for emphasis. As you can see in my other comments I know very much what stocks are.What do you think happens to the money once they spend it? It doesn't just disappear.Exactly this. I drop maybe $5 every other month on a ticket or 2. My husband hates it and feels like it's a waste. I tell him I'm just buying the fantasy of winning for an afternoon. I tell him it's the same concept as a lap dance- she doesn't really like you but you paid for the fantasy for the song duration.It's a really common saying amongst idiots to say that the lottery is only for dumb people when it actually is (apart from extreme cases) pretty low risk, especially compared to betting.> Idiot tax if you buy more than a few tickets.\n\n...except those rare scenarios where the expectation value of a ticket goes above its price (happened a few times in Powerball) - i.e. you could buy *every* ticket, and as long as no one else won, you'd make a profit.It's cheaper than a movie ticket.Only this one you have the privilege of paying for?15 Billions and still worse than VRChatno legs sure, but what about head?But he can throw 15b on stupid shit and still be eternally rich.\n\nMe on the other hand, I calculate how to I spend 15 on basic needs.15 billion and only 8k usersHe didn't even had it. That's why when talking about most millionaires or billionaires they talk about \"their net worth value\" which is the value of their financial and non-financial assets. He still has the assets, is just that their value is way less than before. You don't lose it until you sell it.Problem is anyone who wins over 1m$ statistically end up dead or bankrupt within 5 years.  Their friends and family come running with hands held out and not to mention the million dollar car and house purchases that cost a fortune to maintain.  And when I say friends and family I\u2019m talking third cousin twice removed all the sudden shows up and someone\u2019s cousins cousin by marriage appears.  As for friends everyone you ever went to school with who could even remember they went with you shows up.\n\nThe few who did not give any way usually ended up killing themselves when their friends and family stopped talking to them for being greedy.  \n\nThere were a few that also died in home invasions from robbers looking for valuables or cash.  When caught the robbers expected the person to have a bunch of cash on hand.>I know what makes me happy.\n\n>and the tastiest foods...I love great foods.\n\nThats a lot of goddamn tacos...I would literally disappear on a sail boat. Something about 50-60 feet with beautiful woodwork that would take help to maintain. Sometimes docked in luxury marinas sometimes moored in remote locations. Comfy, under the radar.Make the rent affordable so you don't become asshole greedy landlordIf you're interested in earning money like that, you're probably not gambling the money in a Lottery.with even just 10 million I could live for 80 years as if I were making more than 100k per yearShoot, even if you assume 60% for a lump sum payout, 50% for taxes, you could throw that into a money market account at 2% and earn $1 million a month for the rest of your life.This is the best thread on here. Hahahahttps://youtu.be/ZohXO-WdbLcI saw this somewhere once and it stuck with me: if you made 5000 dollars a day from when Christopher Columbus landed in North America until now...you would not have a billion dollars.Just gimme the money alreadyafter reading your comment I would like to recommend a film.\n\nBrewster's Millions\n\nMight give you some tips on succeeding this challenge\n\n(Using priceless stamps on normal mail is a good one)And then you remember that it's 3M$ off, an amount of money I couldn't even imagine having.And assuming the person who won it isn't stupid (odds are ironically against them there), they'll be an actual billionaire in no time.Nah, the 900 million is how much you get if you take it all at once instead of over 30 years. They tax around 1/3 of the 900 million and then there may be state tax as well depending on the state.  We are still a long way off of billion.Before taxes. In other words, not close at all...And then tax it 40%. They\u2019d be left with $600,000,000. So not really that close.That shit's just going to keep tanking for the foreseeable future.if you round down he\u2019ll have 0 billion!No tres coma club today :(With this simple trick.I'd like to let them win as long as I could go home with a literal suitcase filled to the brim with $10k bricks.\n\nThe dividends alone from investing $800MM in just Coca-cola stocks would be like $20MM/yr at the current price. Capital Gains Tax would leave you with like $14MM/yr, which is $1.16MM/mo or $269k/wk.\n\nIn a single year, I could end poverty in my town singlehandedly and have enough money leftover to do basically anything that money can buy. That's just on dividend payments.60% of the time, they win every time.And putin is betting that the US is going to get tired of shoving money into their pockets. Hahahaha, that's a foolish hope if I ever saw one. Regardless who is in power in Washington, arms gotta flow. And Ukraine is the perfect recipient.Yay defense contractors! /sI'll just have to wipe my tears with these millions upon millions of dollar bills. Hope I have enough.Lots of states have tax brackets as well. I think the top rate is over 13 percent, and if you are in New York City they have a separate city income tax, uncertain of it applies to prize, I would guess so.\n\nAnd if you happen to be travelling and purchase the ticket in another state, they get their share, and your home state also gets a cut. You will get a credit for taxes paid to other states, but this will only save you a few percent off of your home states tax bill most likely.Does the county tax take effect by where you purchase the ticket or by home address of the winner?Could be taxed 99.50% and wouldn\u2019t have to work another day on their lifeThe annuity is taxed exactly the same, as income, you just have to pay it every year instead of once.Nearly ALL winners of Powerball have chosen the cash option, in which you get 50% of the prize pool, and taxes are taken from that remainder. The other option is to receive the entire prize in the form of an annuity which pays out once a year for the following 30 years, and taxes are collected from each annual payment. \n\nUS Federal taxes on large lottery jackpot winnings are 37%, but additional taxes are taken by several states, so the final total depends on where you live. \n\nIn California, there is NO state income tax so the winner, who most likely chose the cash option, will probably net about $642.6 million.If you take the lump sum you can build interest on it and theoretically make more than the static amount per month. In the end it doesn\u2019t really matter, you\u2019re still rich, it\u2019s just about flexibility and potential[deleted]I don't know man, avocado toast and coffee can apparently break any budget.The idea basically comes down to \u201c30 years doesn\u2019t keep up with inflation.\u201d\n\nYes that annuity is also great, but if you take the lump sum and leave it sitting to earn compounding interest over those 30 years\u2026 as I understand it, the math simply cannot compare.The ticket is purchased from a particular state. You could travel to a different state to purchase the ticket but you can't claim in a different place generally.You would have to get a new driver's license in November and wait until January to cash the ticket.  Some states, such as California, are known to be aggressive about going after money, so that might not work.  It can be argued that you earned the money this year even though you waited until next year to cash the ticket.It's not about where YOU live. It's where you bought the ticket. In AZ it's taxable income. In CA it's not.Um... that math is definitely wrong.  57% of 2 billion is more than a billion.... 50% of 2 billion is a billion. Not sure where you got $550M from.Also the shop that sells the ticket gets part of \u201cyour\u201d prize. Also there are smaller winners (the 5 numbers but no powerball etc) that get paid out of the jackpot.The take home was 925, then that gets taxed -AGAIN-The point they're making is that it's always better to take the lump sum.  Even if you barely do any investment with it you're going to do better than taking the annuity.If the villagers didn't want the dragon hoarding the gold then they shouldn't have given him their gold in the first place lolYou don't understand how investments work.\n\nWhen you invest money in a company, they spend that money on salaries, building factories, etc. That stuff generates value over time.\n\nThis is why capitalism works in the first place - investing money means that more value is generated over time, making people richer, which in turn gives them even more money to invest. This all results in society becoming more and more productive over time.IMO, if you're taking out a loan using stock you haven't paid tax on as collateral, that should count as gains on the stock. You've sold it to your creditors at that point.You\u2026.you want teeth?that much money doesnt sit around gathering dust it sits around gathering more money.You...you think billionaires don't put their wealth to productive use?Which doesn't do anything positive for the economy, so what's your point?The older I get, the more I realize that way more people do Coke than I realized.There's a certain segment of Reddit that is *offended* that people have a better life than them. They'll gnash teeth and throw tantrums until the world is brought to the same level of misery as them.Right?  These people think there is a limited amount of wealth to go aroundThe vast majority of billionaires money are in companies not sitting in cash in a vault...>Blowing the money isn't as good for the person, but it is better the economy as it means that money is being cycled into the economy rather than sitting gathering cyber dust in a bank account.\n\nInvestments, where most of the billionaires \"money\" actually is, are not sitting in a bank account.  They are used as the backing to re-generate wealth over and over again, which goes into payroll, vendors, and general expansion of our economy as reflected in GDP.\n\nBlown money goes into the economy once.You know Scrooge McDuck is just a cartoon character right?  \n\nIt is truly scary the extent to which so many redditors (and presumably general population) have absolutely no idea how money and the economy works.Do you think Elon's Musk net worth is liquid cash sitting in a bank or something? Jesus christ, Redditors.Never said it did.  It goes out and pays some companies and taxes.  Maybe even contributes to a small increase in GDP as a result.  But then it doesn't do that the next year.      \nSo I never said it's NO good, I said it isn't as good as repetitive use as a backing for recreating that on a regular basis.You don\u2019t know her!Still less fun than Playstation Home.Just think of what the creators of VR chat could have done with 15 billion.15 billion and still worse than RecRoomAh yes, the entire 15 billion went to only horizon worlds of coursePretty sure 15 billion dollars worth of head leaves you literally sucked inside out.What use is head when you're cut off from the pelvis down?They can't even realize it's full value because starting the liquidation process would tank stock values lolWe also talk about companies as being worth their market cap. Should that change too?Yup. It\u2019s one of those \u201cman behind the curtain\u201d things. A lot of These people are largely *speculative* mil/billionaires.I've spent 40 years teaching people in no uncertain terms that I'm a bit of an asshole, so there should be no surprises when I disappear like a fart in the wind should I win a big lottery.I am so fucking glad in this single instance that I've removed myself on purpose from most of my family and my reactive attachment disorder prevents me from having any friends that I could live comfortably without kms myself.I would follow that one reddit post to a T, set up trusts or something similar that pays regularly to family, but I\u2019d include super small percentages the farther I go down the tree. No stone unturned so they don\u2019t come back legally asking for money. I\u2019m already giving them money.Lol you charge what the market can bear and pay a share of excess profits as bonuses to your employees\n\nSo the employees who make around 50 to 200k per year can use their greed to minimise ur work and maximise ur profits.\n\nWelcome to businessYup 968 millionBut if you had $997m then $3m would be a little over 1 month of interest in a 3% savings account\u2026 so as long as you could spend less than about $1m/mo for the first 2 months then you\u2019d be a billionaire by about Christmashe difference between a million dollars and a billion dollars is about a billion dollars.3 million is enough for me to retire on more than comfortably. And I'm 27. It's a ridiculous amount of money. \n\nWhich makes that jackpot truly insane.With enough inflation we all may become billionaires \ud83d\ude05He has a car whose doors open like this \ud83e\udef2\ud83e\udef1\n\nNOT LIKE THIS \u270b\ud83e\udd1a\n\nNOT LIKE THIS \ud83e\udef1\ud83e\udef1\u201cBe the IRS\u201d\n\nWell shit I should\u2019ve started there.The peasantry *hates* this one simple trickThis guy doesn\u2019t dream. He lottery dreams \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: what I meant to say is you\u2019ve thought this through and I like it.I\u2019m not gonna lie, this smells like pure gasolineMore like 37%your mistake is in assuming the puppet theatre that is globalism has more than a single factionwhile I'm certainly not arguing **for** the winner because fucked if I have a million let alone multi millions, but I will say I'd be upset if I win a thousand dollars and after taxes I'd won $400.\n\nI'm also Canadian so really what I'm saying is I'd be upset my lottery winnings turned out like my average pay cheque.That's also true. People get really fucking stupid when they hear winnings are taxed, as if those enormous payouts aren't an unfathomable amount more than they'd otherwise see in their entire lives.\n\nOne can argue that the average person loses huge amounts of money to gambling, and that is a perfectly valid take. That's rarely what the people who fixate on the taxes ever even begin to consider though, they're usually mentally 13 years old and have never gotten past the \"but it's MINE!\" stage of their lives.Not OP but I always thought that they got Taxed the same amount but if they opted for the cash it all out at once option you get way less than the 2.1bil, aka whoever runs Powerball gives you a lower total amount - I always assumed this is because they can't use it to generate more money\n\nLike ok sure you can either get 2.1 bil over x years at y per week\n\nOr you get 1.4bil all right now because we can't use all that money in the meantime.But you do get less money if you go lump sumYeah sure but would you really? That much money is going to be hard to wrangle either way but even if you don\u2019t invest it yourself taking it in the yearly payments is still so much god damned money that you don\u2019t need to invest it to live like a rich asshole the rest of your life, your kids lives, your grandkids lives, etc. and you\u2019ll still be investing an ass load of money from the yearly payouts you\u2019re just less likely to burn it all within 5 years and be fucked.Lottery recently had a pay freeze in Michigan if I remember correctlyThe lotteries are government run. So you're basically asking \"what if the US government went out of business?\"\nState income taxes for lotteries like Powerball and Megamillions are based on where you buy the ticket, and you have to claim it where you bought it (not that you have a choice\u2026there\u2019s a record of where every ticket is purchased).\n\n[Lottery state tax](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/23/location-matters-tax-wise-when-you-buy-those-powerball-tickets.html)57% is if you take annual payments.  550m if you take a lump sum.2 billion is typically the annuity, so doled out over time, vs taking the lump which is considerably less, then the taxes appply.No they don't. They get paid from the lottery separately depending on state lawsWhat? The US lottery is wild. Do they really take that much for the lump sum option over there? I mean, it\u2019s still a crazy amount of money but damn!Lol why wtf?Its not taxed again, half goes to the lotto, half goes to you, then you get taxed. thats why its 997mil after winning, then the tax around 46% tops if like cali, and end up with around 540 milThat\u2019s not a second tax. The initial drop is taking the cash instead of an annuity. That lump sum is then taxed, leaving you around ~$550 millionI suppose the annual payments may be better if you KNOW you're terrible with $$$ and would blow the lump sum on some dumb investment.Think of it as similar to taking a HELOC on your house\n\nYou haven't really sold the house to the creditors at that point - you retain the risks and rewards of owning the houseGathering money for one person to hoard. Traditional billionaires suck money out of the economy regardless of what the ruling class wants you to believe. There's a reason we produce all the food we need and throw half away or why there are more empty homes in America than homeless people and it's cause money is being hoarded at the top. Billionaires are not generating more valueNah man they don't go to Walmart and buy everything so its a waste!Productive for whom?This is my favorite thing about this thread. Like all these billionaire/millionaires with their wealth tied in assets don\u2019t create thousands of jobs and/or new productsLike 90% of their wealth? No. They uses billions sure but percentage wise bezos donates less than most minimum wage workers.

Liquidation only hurts a stock price if there's no other ostensible reason besides overvaluation.They can do it slowly over years. Bill gates has unloaded most of his MSFT stocks.Yes because it's entirely bullshitToo short of a turnaround, just yolo it on $SPY callsImagine just having to spend less than $1mil per month to be not only set up for life, but keep getting more money, and you still spend it all in less than 5 years.can a bank even insure that amount of money, like would it even be safe to put it all in one accountThe federal tax liability on that is 37% plus whatever your state charges, my state is 7.5% so after tax that's just over 553mil if you averaged 7% for 30 years you'd end up with around 4bil assuming you spent none of it. \n\nIt would take about 10 years at that rate to hit 1bil. And it basically doubles every 10 years after assuming you are reinvesting all the gains and spending nothing...Lottery winners hate this one trickWe really doIt smells like bigfoots dick!It stings the nostrils. In a good way.My brain flooded with dopamine when I read that. Thank you. That movies going on my revisit list. So good.Taxes are a necessary thing, if you want shit like, you know, roads and first responders.\n\nMy *only* complaint in the US is that most of it goes to defense firms instead of public works.Unless you are making more than 170k you can keep 75% or moreSo the annuity is actually an interest bearing trust where they put the same amount in the trust as they would pay you immediately, and the interest is such that you will have received the advertised amount after the 29 years of interest less payments.Up front, sure, but inflation will absolutely destroy any of those perceived gains on installed payouts.Or you can buy $10 million a year in treasury bonds to have a fixed income of millions a month AND not need to touch the principal to get money.\n\nLump sum is *always* better unless you are a complete moron, which to be fair is most winners. People are financially illiterate.I have an ex-colleague that won 4 million in CA and told me this tidbit as he was quitting. His cash take home was 1.8 million. My comment is from what I heard from him. Thanks for the info.They're not taxing the lump sum, it's the fact that you're getting it up front rather than as a 30-year annuity. The advertised winning them out in every major lottery that I'm aware of is paid out over a longer term usually 30 years.The lump sum amount is the actual money you're winning in the lottery.\n\nThe advertised jackpot is what you would get if you decided to take it as an annuity instead.\n\nAnnuities pay out more than you put in, because they invest the money in safe investments while they're waiting for you to take that portion.Yeah, lump sum the take home is *only* $631,615,904.It's not taxed twice they are wrong.  First one is taking the lump sum a cash payment of the actual money on hand.  The advertising for 2 billion is if you take a 30 year annuity payment.\n\nWhich is historically the worse option the annuity is a 1-3% investment and a basic bare bones mutal fund index is a 7% return.  You'll double your wealth in 10 years so by 30 you'd have about double what the annuity would pay.\n\nNow as to the taxes yes you'll pay on it. After taking the cash in hand lump sum you'll pay federal and state taxes figure that works out to about 55% depending on your state.  Some like Wisconsin and Florida have none and other places like California have 13% on high earners. Federal is 47% .Half doesn't go to th lotto it just doesn't exist yet. The jackpot is always listed as the cash payment over 30 years.  Lump sum is taking the cash on hand and walking away today.\n\nThe Lotto pays about 1-3% interest whereas a mutual fund will pay about 7% historically. Take the cash pay the taxes and then earn 2x as much over the same time by leaving it in the market.[deleted]Who said anything about donating?\n\nGod, this thread is depressing, and truly shows how financial illiteracy can perpetuate poverty.Try 99.9%I wanna go on this golf trip.Still less fun than touching grassAnd if someone is willing to buy that much stock at face value.

I'd laugh.Nah you\u2019d definitely spread it out lots of institutions and asset classes, if you had any sense\n\nBut as long as your average return was 3% or higher it would still apply the sameIt may not be 12 inches but it smells like a foot!It\u2019s not most, not by a long shot. Only if you aren\u2019t counting local, state and FICA taxes do you begin to approach \u201cmost\u201d.Sure, but 1 billion (after taxes) spread out over 30 years will still be millions of dollars every year. If inflation gets so bad that even 33 million a year is not enough, you're gonna be fucked anyway. Just because you aren't min/maxing returns doesn't mean the installment plan is a bad option.The only reason i know is because we were looking it up at work today. \n\nLooks like in California stores get between [4.5% & 6% of ticket sales and .5% \\(max 1 M) of the jackpots](https://playport.com/do-stores-make-money-selling-lottery-tickets-how-much/#:~:text=The%20standard%20retailer%20commission%20rate,out%20of%20the%20winner's%20prize.&text=Note%3A%20Occasionally%2C%20there%20will%20be,Retailers%20may%20earn%20extra%20commissions.). So wherever your ex-colleague got the ticket, the store got about $20,000 from the lotteryIf someone dies before the 30 years is up, does it pay out to their estate?Half goes to the lotto company, half to you, that half is taxed. If you want a billion from the lottery the winning amount would have to start at like $3.7+ billionSome banks invest heavily in destructive industries though. I know RBC has been involved with the wetsuweten pipeline in some capacity.Yah same. I'm gonna arrange a coke binge golf weekend with the boys, brb.Wanna know what's even more fun?Of course. It's a fully negotiable instrument and the residual would remain with the estate or their heirs.There are plenty of threads on Reddit about lotto stuff, but basically you\u2019ll want to have a trust hold the money. I\u2019d imagine that since the trust is it\u2019s own entity the payments would continue if the person who won died. \n\nThen you\u2019d just have normal stuff to deal with, like who gets control of the trust\u2026.That's right, however the half of the lottery company isn't really that. Their advertising a $2 billion dollar jackpot but that's the cumulative payout over 30 years. They are buying a 30-year annuity. The cost of that annuity is approximately $929 million dollars which is the jackpot if you want it all up front. It's the same to them either way, but they're not retaining any of the jackpot.Hey, it's me, your boy.Your...I've been in suspense for eight hours. Tell us already!",
